2013-06-21 14:43:55	sabreman	is there any way to get chromium to use the transmission-remote command as the default handler for magnet links?
2013-06-21 14:44:08	sabreman	im running arch with gnome 3.8 as my DE
2013-06-21 14:44:23	sabreman	but would love a general solution that would work everywhere
2013-06-21 14:45:14	smw	sabreman, I use transmission-qt for that

2013-06-21 14:45:24	sabreman	i've tried this one already https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/MagnetLinks (the gnome solution)
2013-06-21 14:45:42	sabreman	smw: well, the qt/gtk version DO work with magnet links 
2013-06-21 14:45:54	sabreman	but i spesificly want the daemon version
2013-06-21 14:46:00	smw	sabreman, yes, I use transmission-qt with a remote session
2013-06-21 14:46:45	smw	sabreman, I am running transmission-daemon. I have transmission-qt connected to the daemon. When I click on a magnet link, it goes to transmission-qt which sends it to transmission-daemon
2013-06-21 14:48:05	sabreman	huh
2013-06-21 14:48:09	sabreman	i didn't notice that

2013-06-21 14:48:28	smw	sabreman, works for torrent files too
2013-06-21 14:48:44	smw	sabreman, and gives you all the features of a transmission gui as an added bonus

2013-06-21 14:48:55	sabreman	i'm looking at the setting right now, i have the webclient enabled, but the torrents currently being downloaded by the daemon aren't showing up in the gtk window
2013-06-21 14:49:09	smw	yeah
2013-06-21 14:49:26	smw	you need to use transmission-qt and set the remote session option
2013-06-21 14:49:41	smw	no transmission-gtk. I ended up uninstalling it so it wouldn't be confusing
2013-06-21 14:54:44	sabreman	huh
2013-06-21 14:55:01	sabreman	appernatly the gtk version doesnt have the "change session" option
2013-06-21 14:55:05	sabreman	interesting

2013-06-21 16:13:02	Lacrocivious	sabreman: Transmission-gtk predates both transmission-daemon and transmission-qt, and would require significant work to be able to talk to the daemon the way transmission-qt does. It is about history and points on the linear timeline, is all
2013-06-21 16:14:07	Lacrocivious	sabreman: Apart from that, the gui clients -- gtk and qt -- are feature identical
