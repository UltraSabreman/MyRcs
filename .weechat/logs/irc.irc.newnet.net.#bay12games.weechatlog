2013-01-31 12:14:55	uristmchambel	Pink Floyd is trippy as heck.
2013-01-31 12:17:07	nuthulu	Also they have loads of songs, that are all like ten minutes long
2013-01-31 12:17:10	AfterShave	I don't know really what this is about
2013-01-31 12:17:13	AfterShave	But Shpongle
2013-01-31 12:17:27	nuthulu	So you get a lot of music on one album
2013-01-31 12:17:32	AfterShave	I'd say that kind of trippy music is better
2013-01-31 12:18:51	Mercy404|Work	Animals was such a good album
2013-01-31 12:19:15	uristmchambel	Yeah concept albums are crazy

2013-01-31 12:20:37	uristmchambel	I dosed on diphenhydramine last night and hallucinated to pink floyd
2013-01-31 12:20:56	uristmchambel	Writing a thesis on delirium.  It wasn't for fun.
2013-01-31 12:21:12	uristmchambel	way different than psychedelic hallucinations.
2013-01-31 12:21:40	AfterShave	Writing a thesis really sounds like the wrong setting for tripping :P
2013-01-31 12:21:49	Afthartos	high fever gives you some weird trips :D
2013-01-31 12:22:12	uristmchambel	Yeah it is just very similar to fever-induced hallucinations.

2013-02-01 00:32:27	Justin	guys
2013-02-01 00:32:30	Justin	how do you think the SHIELD will cost?
2013-02-01 00:32:44	Justin	Project SHIELD, that is
2013-02-01 00:33:15	Sabreman	infinity dollars
2013-02-01 00:33:29	Sabreman	i love how my irc clinet sets almsot everyones name to pink
2013-02-01 00:33:32	Sabreman	it really like pink
2013-02-01 00:33:42	Justin	heh
2013-02-01 00:33:56	Justin	anyway I think we may have a worthy successor to Xperia PLAY
2013-02-01 00:33:57	Justin	:V
2013-02-01 00:34:13	Sabreman	so I'm on my second fort now. I'm so in love with this game I can't belive i took so long to get into it
2013-02-01 00:34:20	Sabreman	ITS SO FREAKING AWESOME
2013-02-01 00:34:22	Justin	But I have a feeling the price will be hiked up for its remote gaming feature
2013-02-01 00:34:35	Justin	But I'm not interested in it since I own a GTX 570
2013-02-01 00:34:41	Justin	not a GTX 6xx
2013-02-01 00:34:48	Justin	which the SHIELD only supports, for some reason
2013-02-01 00:35:01	Sabreman	what is project shiled
2013-02-01 00:35:04	Sabreman	never heard of it.
2013-02-01 00:35:17	Justin	also since it's streaming I need wifi to game on the project shield
2013-02-01 00:35:20	Justin	which is kind of silly
2013-02-01 00:35:26	Justin	Sabreman: A new portable console by NVIDIA
2013-02-01 00:35:46	Justin	anyway if they tack on the remote gaming feature as an extra rather than something they think is worth hiking up the price for
2013-02-01 00:35:49	Justin	I may buy it
2013-02-01 00:35:52	Justin	Because I won't use it anyway
2013-02-01 00:35:55	Justin	other than that it looks solid
2013-02-01 00:36:01	Justin	not sure how it's going to fit into my pockets though
2013-02-01 00:36:22	Sabreman	I'd just carry an powerbook around in my pockets
2013-02-01 00:36:31	Sabreman	althoyh my pockets are fairly huge
2013-02-01 00:36:36	Justin	haha
2013-02-01 00:36:40	Justin	http://www.redmondpie.com/nvidia-shield-announced-a-portable-android-gaming-console-powered-by-tegra-4-with-full-sized-controller/
2013-02-01 00:36:51	Justin	it is around the size of an xbox 360 controller
2013-02-01 00:38:01	Phazorx	games are serious business, you need proper environment which includes comfortable chair, lack on distractions, propper controllers and large screen... you cant take that with you - hence there is no sence in portable gaming platform

2013-02-01 00:39:29	Justin	well there has got to be compromises while you're going out
2013-02-01 00:39:43	Justin	but yes I enjoy a good book more than a portable device, most of  the time
2013-02-01 00:39:53	Phazorx	smart phone actualy is more than necessary as far as that goes
2013-02-01 00:40:07	Justin	???
2013-02-01 00:40:13	Phazorx	and that phone reads books to me aloud not to mention has some games on it
2013-02-01 00:40:22	Trifase	<Justin> but yes I enjoy a good book more than a portable device, most of  the time
2013-02-01 00:40:55	Trifase	Wait, isn't a book a portable device?
2013-02-01 00:41:00	Justin	well
2013-02-01 00:41:02	Justin	electronic device
2013-02-01 00:41:07	Justin	if that clarifies anything
2013-02-01 00:41:07	Justin	:V
2013-02-01 00:42:16	Phazorx	i'm actually yt to find a reader that is comfrotable though
2013-02-01 00:42:20	Sabreman	IDK About you but i'm perfectly happywith my gameboy colors
2013-02-01 00:42:25	Sabreman	it fits all my portable gaming needs perfectly
2013-02-01 00:42:34	Sabreman	no need for these modern doohickies
2013-02-01 00:42:56	Sabreman	WAIT, i don't even need that
2013-02-01 00:43:00	Sabreman	I have my rock and stick
2013-02-01 00:43:06	Sabreman	waaaay better then some stupid computer games.
2013-02-01 00:43:18	Sabreman	I can hit things with a rock, AND with a stick
2013-02-01 00:43:23	Sabreman	ty to do that in your crisys
2013-02-01 00:43:41	Sabreman	well ima go again, glhf
2013-02-01 00:43:49	Phazorx	it's the community that count :)
2013-02-01 00:44:10	Phazorx	you need social media platform to get mob orginized with sticks and stones

2013-02-01 00:48:26	Justin	There's already a cure of AIDS

2013-02-01 05:15:16	uristmchambel	I need a break from df anyways.  all of my fortress designs always look the same.
2013-02-01 05:15:43	kullervo	uristmchambel: build a pyramid on ground level
2013-02-01 05:15:54	kullervo	then build a large magma chamber over that pyramid
2013-02-01 05:16:02	kullervo	the magma must be pressurized
2013-02-01 05:16:27	uristmchambel	kullervo
2013-02-01 05:16:34	uristmchambel	I might just try that
2013-02-01 05:16:48	uristmchambel	I have also never hit candy...
2013-02-01 05:16:53	kullervo	and there must be a trap door you can open at will to pour all that magma over your pyramid, which has the entrance to your base on top of it
2013-02-01 05:17:17	kullervo	there should probably be a ceiling of some sort to avoid the hot stuff from going inside

2013-02-01 05:29:10	uristmchambel	shivering isles was the best dlc on 360 imo
2013-02-01 05:29:34	Soadreqm	The time it came out, I was using a computer literally salvaged from trash, and then I heard of all the diverse issues people had with it.
2013-02-01 05:30:04	sandb0x	don't remember having issues with it
2013-02-01 05:30:24	uristmchambel	haha yeah
2013-02-01 05:30:27	@Makrond	oblivion was okay but it really should have been better
2013-02-01 05:30:40	uristmchambel	now you can play it on a calculator it seems like
2013-02-01 05:30:41	Soadreqm	I meant "issues" as in "I hate this game Morrowind was better Bethesda has too many dicks in its corporate mouth".
2013-02-01 05:31:00	@Makrond	and then for skyrim they finally figured out what visual design is
2013-02-01 05:31:04	@Makrond	but forgot what game design is
2013-02-01 05:31:23	@Makrond	can't make a system work? drop it entirely!
2013-02-01 05:31:31	@Makrond	nobody will know.
2013-02-01 05:31:47	Soadreqm	I think Skyrim is a great game that is tragically crippled by a terrible user interface.

2013-02-01 05:32:07	sandbox	I don't buy incomplete games ;p
2013-02-01 05:32:09	@Makrond	man i dunno i played morrowind
2013-02-01 05:32:32	Soadreqm	The inventory in Morrowind wasn't very pretty or immersive, but it got the job done. The inventory in Skyrim no longer gets the job done.
2013-02-01 05:32:57	@Makrond	i guess the problem is the more they get right in the elder scrolls the more they give up all the cool little shit that actually made the game fun
2013-02-01 05:33:10	@Makrond	it's like the definition of design by committee or some shit
2013-02-01 05:33:11	Soadreqm	Would it really have been so difficult to add the ability to switch weapons without pausing the game? :(
2013-02-01 05:33:27	@Makrond	well you can use hotkeys
2013-02-01 05:33:35	uristmchambel	that is why i like df.  he doesn't sell out
2013-02-01 05:33:51	Soadreqm	Wait, there are hotkeys? :o
2013-02-01 05:33:51	Soadreqm	Oh man.
2013-02-01 05:33:51	@Makrond	even the xbox controller lets you assign something to the left and right dpad
2013-02-01 05:34:01	Afthartos	pr guy from gog.com told me to share this with you guys :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8wyUxIVvcM

2013-02-01 05:34:14	Soadreqm	How do you use them?
2013-02-01 05:34:15	@Makrond	I think there's only 4 on PC? unless they fixed that
2013-02-01 05:34:30	@Makrond	you go into the q menu and hold 1 or 2 or whatever when something is highlighted
2013-02-01 05:34:33	Soadreqm	I specifically looked for hotkeys, but didn't find any.
2013-02-01 05:34:48	@Makrond	it literally doesn't tell you how to use them ever
2013-02-01 05:35:24	Soadreqm	Yeah, this is going to make the game so much better for me.
2013-02-01 05:35:25	sandbox	neither did Fallout3/NV
2013-02-01 05:36:39	@Makrond	i'm a compulsive hoarder so i always have like 20 spells and 5 different weapons
2013-02-01 05:36:45	@Makrond	so there's never enough hotkeys for me :(
2013-02-01 05:36:57	Soadreqm	The main other thing I've been meaning to whine about are the dungeons. They feel like they were specifically designed to be dungeons.
2013-02-01 05:37:04	@Makrond	yeah
2013-02-01 05:37:06	Soadreqm	Which they WERE, but it's not supposed to show.
2013-02-01 05:37:26	@Makrond	it's better than oblivion where most of the dungeons were just designed to be dark caves that served no purpose
2013-02-01 05:37:27	sandbox	some of the info only appeared on the loading screens, which if you have a fast drive then you won't have time to read the tips
2013-02-01 05:37:50	Soadreqm	It gives me this Adventure Time "Look at all these awesome DUNGEONS we got" vibe. :P
2013-02-01 05:38:13	Phazorx	Makrond: amount of light was factored into detection of player by NPCs
2013-02-01 05:38:21	@Makrond	like pretty much every dungeon has some handplaced shit that tells you Shit Happened Here At Some Point
2013-02-01 05:38:34	Soadreqm	Whereas the ones in Morrowind often just looked like random caves that had been haphazardly converted into bandit hideouts with the addition of a few doors and platforms.
2013-02-01 05:39:19	@Makrond	there are a few caves that feel like that in skyrim at least
2013-02-01 05:39:23	@Makrond	like the lost knife hideout
2013-02-01 05:39:39	@Makrond	which incidentally you will probably run through about 6 different times for various sidequests
2013-02-01 05:39:53	@Makrond	the first time it was neat but after a while it just becomes a chore!
2013-02-01 05:39:58	Soadreqm	Are there any caves that don't have those silly exit nodes?
2013-02-01 05:40:06	@Makrond	very few
2013-02-01 05:40:31	@Makrond	I mean if you LIKE running all the way back to the start of the cave then you can do that i guess
2013-02-01 05:40:50	Soadreqm	I can kind of see why they did those. Some caves are really huge, and it would be a chore to trek all the way up once you beat the obligatory boss.
2013-02-01 05:41:24	Soadreqm	But it would have been better if the feature actually made sense. :P
2013-02-01 05:41:28	@Makrond	there's a couple of tiny caves that only have one entrance
2013-02-01 05:41:31	uristmchambel	In skyrim they do a good job of looping them back
2013-02-01 05:41:35	Soadreqm	Or was obviously magical and therefore exempt from sense.
2013-02-01 05:41:45	Soadreqm	Like a spell that teleports you to the entrance.
2013-02-01 05:41:51	@Makrond	oh yeah and there's a bunch that just loop back around instead of having actual separate exits
2013-02-01 05:42:18	uristmchambel	that is my fav
2013-02-01 05:42:37	uristmchambel	secret passage to right back where you started
2013-02-01 05:42:38	uristmchambel	excellent
2013-02-01 05:42:43	uristmchambel	*all the loot*
2013-02-01 05:53:55	FFLaguna	[22:33:12] <@Makrond> it's like the definition of design by committee or some shit
2013-02-01 05:54:04	FFLaguna	The word you were looking for was mainstreamization
2013-02-01 05:54:57	FFLaguna	"design by committee" is "the term used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants, particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge, such as needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision. This
2013-02-01 05:54:57	FFLaguna	democratic design process is in contrast to autocratic design, or design by dictator, where the project leader decides on the design."
2013-02-01 05:56:43	sandbox	aka dumbing down
2013-02-01 05:57:55	@Makrond	FFLaguna: i dunno, i'd say skyrim has plenty of internal inconsistency and banality :V
2013-02-01 05:58:07	@Makrond	but yeah no you're right it's not the term I was looking for
2013-02-01 05:58:23	@Makrond	because it does have a unifying vision at least, that vision just sucks
2013-02-01 05:58:43	uristmchambel	it just feels soul-less
2013-02-01 05:59:03	uristmchambel	df has way more soul
2013-02-01 05:59:09	uristmchambel	which is weird
2013-02-01 06:12:58	GauHelldragon__	yes but you can decapitate people
2013-02-01 06:13:22	GauHelldragon__	also mage/archery is much more viable!
2013-02-01 06:13:41	uristmchambel	Very true
2013-02-01 06:14:01	uristmchambel	I guess it mainly depends on which perspective you feel like being in.  Mer or God.

2013-02-01 06:43:43	Justin	are MBT shoes good?
2013-02-01 06:43:47	Justin	my parents want to buy them for me
2013-02-01 06:43:51	Justin	or are they overpriced junk
2013-02-01 06:43:57	sandbox	never heard of them
2013-02-01 06:44:25	uristmchambel	idk i just wear dress shoes and new balance
2013-02-01 06:44:29	uristmchambel	I'm cheap though
2013-02-01 06:44:36	sandbox	apparently the Chinese go crazy for Clark's shoes
2013-02-01 06:45:06	sandbox	which seems bizarre
2013-02-01 06:45:21	Waywinkle	if parents are buying
2013-02-01 06:45:24	Justin	oh really?
2013-02-01 06:45:24	Waywinkle	then who cares
2013-02-01 06:45:27	Justin	My dad has a Clark sandal
2013-02-01 06:45:34	Justin	Waywinkle: Well, yeah
2013-02-01 06:45:40	Justin	Anyway MBT claims to improve your posture
2013-02-01 06:45:43	Waywinkle	maybe about the junk part
2013-02-01 06:45:47	Justin	and activate "protective muscles"
2013-02-01 06:45:53	Waywinkle	haha
2013-02-01 06:45:57	Waywinkle	sounds like bull to me
2013-02-01 06:45:58	Justin	also I wore it and it feels funny
2013-02-01 06:46:03	Justin	basically it's curved
2013-02-01 06:46:08	Waywinkle	get them to buy some awesome boots
2013-02-01 06:46:19	Justin	the lowest part of the shoe is at the centre
2013-02-01 06:46:26	Justin	so basically you can rock back and forth while wearing MBT shoes
2013-02-01 06:46:37	Waywinkle	that sounds strange
2013-02-01 06:46:39	sandbox	space boots (before my time)
2013-02-01 06:46:50	Justin	Waywinkle: Think of a rocking chair
2013-02-01 06:46:50	Justin	:V
2013-02-01 06:46:52	Waywinkle	if you want weird shoes you should get those ones with toes
2013-02-01 06:47:02	Justin	in its neutral state the front and back part of the shoes don't touch the ground
2013-02-01 06:47:19	Justin	anyway my parents are desperate to improve my body posture
2013-02-01 06:47:19	Waywinkle	seems like being off balance the whole time
2013-02-01 06:47:23	Waywinkle	haha
2013-02-01 06:47:38	Waywinkle	probably more to do with time spent on cimputer + chair

2013-02-01 06:47:43	Justin	yeah
2013-02-01 06:47:43	Justin	:V

2013-02-01 06:48:12	@Makrond	they are overpriced bullshit but they're not complete bullshit
2013-02-01 06:48:23	Justin	Makrond: Have you tried them?
2013-02-01 06:48:29	@Makrond	nah
2013-02-01 06:48:35	@Makrond	well, I wore them for like 30 seconds
2013-02-01 06:48:41	@Makrond	it was weird and kind of awful tbh
2013-02-01 06:48:48	Justin	Also they are like
2013-02-01 06:48:49	@Makrond	I'd rather just go barefoot
2013-02-01 06:48:52	Justin	80% off
2013-02-01 06:48:59	Justin	so yeah
2013-02-01 06:49:10	Justin	it's still very pricey though
2013-02-01 06:49:21	Justin	at its full price, you could net a GTX 670 with the cash
2013-02-01 06:49:21	Justin	:V
2013-02-01 06:49:27	@Makrond	A lot of people swear by them but uh
2013-02-01 06:49:39	Justin	how about skechers
2013-02-01 06:49:39	Justin	the same?
2013-02-01 06:49:41	@Makrond	a lot of people swear by vffs and those are pretty gimmicky
2013-02-01 06:49:51	Justin	yeah I'm worried that this might be a gimmick
2013-02-01 06:49:51	@Makrond	I've never heard of skechers
2013-02-01 06:49:53	Justin	and not actually help
2013-02-01 06:49:55	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-01 06:50:00	Justin	the shoes also feel weird
2013-02-01 06:50:09	Justin	they are like high-heels
2013-02-01 06:50:11	Justin	on a sneaker
2013-02-01 06:50:25	@Makrond	it might help a little if you're really bad at walking
2013-02-01 06:50:28	Justin	anyway the MBT shoes are really, really heavy
2013-02-01 06:51:15	@Makrond	they are
2013-02-01 06:51:19	@Makrond	the soles are pretty thick
2013-02-01 06:52:26	sandbox	Masai Barefoot Technology, that's ironic
2013-02-01 06:53:05	sandbox	"There have also been claims that MBTs can help get rid of cellulite and burn extra calories (although these claims are no longer made by the manufacturers, the rumour persists, which may be why MBTs are predominantly bought and worn by women)."
2013-02-01 06:53:58	sandbox	wearing shoes helps get rid of cellulite - who knew?
2013-02-01 06:55:35	sandbox	so, by the sounds of it you have to use muscles you normally wouldn't use to stay balanced
2013-02-01 06:57:12	@Makrond	basically
2013-02-01 06:57:33	@Makrond	you also have to alter your stride a bit if you tend to stick your feet way out in front
2013-02-01 06:57:41	@Makrond	because you'll just damage your knees
2013-02-01 06:57:53	sandbox	sounds like it would cause more problems
2013-02-01 06:58:31	@Makrond	supposedly it's a self-correcting thing
2013-02-01 06:58:37	@Makrond	because if you walk wrong it just hurts
2013-02-01 06:58:43	@Makrond	and if you walk right it's fine

2013-02-01 07:02:51	uristmchambel	Yeah I guess you are right haha
2013-02-01 07:03:05	uristmchambel	df on shrooms is actually good too
2013-02-01 07:03:32	@Makrond	http://images.mocpages.com/user_images/2228/1199461553_SPLASH.jpg it is indeed important to beware of fake MBTs
2013-02-01 07:03:52	Waywinkle	df with weed is no good
2013-02-01 07:03:58	Waywinkle	i just play paused the entire time
2013-02-01 07:04:01	Waywinkle	and then after two hours
2013-02-01 07:04:15	Waywinkle	I realise I have designated an entire fort
2013-02-01 07:04:18	Kidiri	I just slept the entire time.
2013-02-01 07:04:20	Waywinkle	for 2 minres to mine out
2013-02-01 07:04:31	uristmchambel	that sucks :P
2013-02-01 07:04:34	Kidiri	And then after two hours
2013-02-01 07:04:36	@Makrond	Waywinkle: by the time they're done you'll have more miners :V
2013-02-01 07:04:39	Kidiri	I woke up.
2013-02-01 07:04:43	uristmchambel	it depends if I smoke indica or sativa
2013-02-01 07:04:52	Waywinkle	haha but they don't mine out in the correct priority
2013-02-01 07:05:05	Waywinkle	so i got no bedrooms
2013-02-01 07:05:12	Kidiri	You should play DF while high on mesquite, uristmchambel.
2013-02-01 07:05:12	uristmchambel	oh boy
2013-02-01 07:05:19	Waywinkle	but they are off mining some mega project
2013-02-01 07:05:25	uristmchambel	Kidiri I will do that some day
2013-02-01 07:05:41	uristmchambel	We should all get lsd and start a df commune
2013-02-01 07:06:00	Waywinkle	im in
2013-02-01 07:06:03	uristmchambel	just need to find a bunch of hippie girls
2013-02-01 07:06:32	@Makrond	this is eerily familiar
2013-02-01 07:06:36	Waywinkle	haha
2013-02-01 07:06:53	Kidiri	Makrond was around when they started doing lsd.
2013-02-01 07:07:08	@Makrond	and kidnapping hippie girls to start 'communes'
2013-02-01 07:07:23	@Makrond	well if'n you ask me 'commune' is awfully close to 'communism' and i don't truck with none of that
2013-02-01 07:07:38	uristmchambel	haha
2013-02-01 07:07:47	Waywinkle	they sometimes end up the same way
2013-02-01 07:08:06	Waywinkle	re: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441326/
2013-02-01 07:08:06	uristmchambel	Well if you read about pure marxism, it is identical to pure libertarianism and pure anarchy
2013-02-01 07:08:11	Kidiri	Society, Makrond?
2013-02-01 07:08:25	@Makrond	uristmchambel: doomed to failure? :V
2013-02-01 07:08:26	Kidiri	Or does that resemble scoialism too much for ya?
2013-02-01 07:08:31	Kidiri	*socialism
2013-02-01 07:08:40	uristmchambel	Makrond I would say yes, because it is too idealistic
2013-02-01 07:09:01	uristmchambel	I'm like ethically liberal and fiscally conservative
2013-02-01 07:09:15	@Makrond	although maybe i'm misunderstanding libertarianism but it seems like marxism is the odd one out there
2013-02-01 07:09:34	@Makrond	a government that controls the means of production would be, well, not very libertarian
2013-02-01 07:09:39	@Makrond	or anarchic for that matter
2013-02-01 07:09:59	uristmchambel	Communism, yes, but pure marxism only explored the evils of capitalism i.e. the exploitation of the proletarian class
2013-02-01 07:10:24	uristmchambel	marx spoke little about marxism.  He mostly just hated capitalism.
2013-02-01 07:10:35	uristmchambel	I can see what you are saying though.
2013-02-01 07:10:53	@Makrond	you're probably right, it's a little hard to separate marxism (and leninism and trotskyism) from communism these days
2013-02-01 07:11:24	Kidiri	What about smedingism?
2013-02-01 07:11:26	uristmchambel	plus socialism/marxism/communism are supposed to be split into economic/governmental systems and I can't remember which is which
2013-02-01 07:11:40	uristmchambel	I think socialism is an economic system
2013-02-01 07:12:10	Kidiri	AKA$
2013-02-01 07:12:27	Kidiri	"Fuck y'all, you're on your own, I hate you guys."
2013-02-01 07:12:32	@Makrond	FFLaguna would know this shit better than me
2013-02-01 07:12:34	uristmchambel	Even the soviet union was far from textbook communism though.  it reinvented it.  it was really just a tyrant rulership.
2013-02-01 07:12:43	BW	Kidiri: i thought that was libertarianism ;p
2013-02-01 07:13:00	Kidiri	TIL smeding is a libertarian.
2013-02-01 07:13:12	uristmchambel	Well, I am a registered libertarian
2013-02-01 07:13:17	FFLaguna	The Soviet Union never called themselves a Communist society
2013-02-01 07:13:32	FFLaguna	I don't think there has ever been a single country on the face of the planet in all of history that called themselves a communist society
2013-02-01 07:13:56	Kidiri	China?
2013-02-01 07:13:59	Kidiri	North Korea?
2013-02-01 07:14:01	@Makrond	the soviet union never really had a chance to implement communism/socialism/whatever
2013-02-01 07:14:03	FFLaguna	China has a Communist Party
2013-02-01 07:14:06	FFLaguna	That is not the same thing at all
2013-02-01 07:14:22	@Makrond	they were planning on it after the bolshevik revolution but it all kind of got sidetracked
2013-02-01 07:14:22	FFLaguna	Communism is the utopian endstate that everyone in a socialist economy strives towards
2013-02-01 07:14:44	FFLaguna	No country ever called themselves a communist country
2013-02-01 07:14:52	FFLaguna	But they called themselves socialist
2013-02-01 07:15:07	FFLaguna	And had a Communist Party that would guide the nation towards the eventual endstate of communism
2013-02-01 07:15:15	FFLaguna	We all know how that turned out
2013-02-01 07:15:15	uristmchambel	Right.  I was saying more along the lines of the communist political movement
2013-02-01 07:15:23	uristmchambel	i.e. soviet communist party
2013-02-01 07:16:08	FFLaguna	Well, none of what you're saying really makes any sense
2013-02-01 07:16:21	@Makrond	my favourite part is when people try to say the nazis were socialist
2013-02-01 07:16:29	FFLaguna	It's like you're talking about which forklifts are best for growing apples
2013-02-01 07:16:32	@Makrond	because omg it's right there in the name
2013-02-01 07:17:09	uristmchambel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state
2013-02-01 07:17:20	Justin	back
2013-02-01 07:17:43	Kidiri	So Justin
2013-02-01 07:17:48	FFLaguna	Read what it says, urist
2013-02-01 07:17:54	Kidiri	How's the maths coming?
2013-02-01 07:18:00	FFLaguna	"Communist state, in popular usage, is a state with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist–Leninist communist ideology as the guiding principle of the state."
2013-02-01 07:18:01	uristmchambel	I did, it seems like it is semantics
2013-02-01 07:18:03	BW	FFLaguna: the komatsu 7750, of course
2013-02-01 07:18:17	@Makrond	ah so i guess marxism was the thing i didn't understand :V
2013-02-01 07:18:36	uristmchambel	If you go to the ukraine now they call themselves a communist state
2013-02-01 07:18:48	FFLaguna	To put that quote simple, a "communist state" is what we call a country that has a "Communist party" in dominant power
2013-02-01 07:19:07	FFLaguna	That's not the same as actually being a communist state/society
2013-02-01 07:19:28	FFLaguna	It's clarifying a term that people studying this USE to refer to states that have a Communist party holding sole power over the state
2013-02-01 07:19:40	uristmchambel	That is like saying that the united states is not a capitalist society because we have socialized wellfare
2013-02-01 07:19:55	Kidiri	SEE!
2013-02-01 07:20:00	Kidiri	OBAMA RUINED EVERYHING
2013-02-01 07:20:10	uristmchambel	not what i'm saying :)
2013-02-01 07:20:11	FFLaguna	No, it's like saying the United States isn't a Western Nation because it's not in the west
2013-02-01 07:20:12	Justin	so
2013-02-01 07:20:18	Justin	uristmchambel is a libertarian?
2013-02-01 07:20:18	Justin	:V
2013-02-01 07:20:30	FFLaguna	"Western Nation" is just the term we use to describe the category the US and a host of other nations fall into
2013-02-01 07:20:42	FFLaguna	"Communist State" is this same kind of thing
2013-02-01 07:20:58	Justin	Kidiri: How's the maths coming?
2013-02-01 07:20:58	FFLaguna	It's just a word people studying this use to communicate regarding socialist states
2013-02-01 07:20:58	Kidiri	Also, FFLaguna, the US lies in the west for me...
2013-02-01 07:20:59	Justin	Oh it's okay
2013-02-01 07:21:22	BW	Kidiri: look east a bit
2013-02-01 07:21:32	FFLaguna	From the page you linked "These Communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries; rather, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries."
2013-02-01 07:21:39	Kidiri	There's Asia, BW.
2013-02-01 07:21:44	BW	farther
2013-02-01 07:21:48	Kidiri	First the Middle-East
2013-02-01 07:21:53	Kidiri	Then the Far-East
2013-02-01 07:22:01	uristmchambel	I get that.  because the utopia could not be realized without the total annihilation of capitalism.
2013-02-01 07:22:05	Justin	AFAIK libertarians are basically ethically liberal and fiscally conservative
2013-02-01 07:22:23	Justin	also almost everyone on the internet is ethically liberal, it's the fiscal part that divides us all! :V
2013-02-01 07:22:40	FFLaguna	uristmchambel - I don't think you know the basic information about this subject one needs to know to discuss it intelligently :|
2013-02-01 07:22:47	uristmchambel	except the fundie christians/ muslims
2013-02-01 07:23:00	Kidiri	I don't, FFLaguna
2013-02-01 07:23:06	Kidiri	Tat's why I keep quiet! =D
2013-02-01 07:23:07	FFLaguna	You're a squirrel. You get a pass
2013-02-01 07:23:26	Kidiri	Save for idiot remarks you're all used top anyway.

2013-02-01 07:27:59	@Makrond	and that happened before they became a crazy theocratic cult
2013-02-01 07:28:00	@Makrond	so
2013-02-01 07:28:07	Justin	urist: No we're talking about real politics

2013-02-01 07:29:19	@Makrond	Justin: the fluff is that they want to spread the peaceful space alien religion to all of auraxis

2013-02-01 07:31:03	@Makrond	BW: yeah they are pretty similar to the dudes from SupCom

2013-02-01 07:32:43	Justin	I find it funny that the NC uses magnetic flak, though
2013-02-01 07:32:43	@Makrond	apart from the fact that the rank names are vaguely religious
2013-02-01 07:33:12	Justin	anyway Makrond I'm sure you're a fan of the TR
2013-02-01 07:33:19	GarthAlgar	<Justin> and I'm a sucker for reverse-engineering other people's tech <- you were from the chinese minority in your country, right?

2013-02-01 07:43:27	Justin	it's not like the other leaders are passionate about PS2 or something
2013-02-01 07:44:41	GarthAlgar	that event was such bullshit
2013-02-01 07:44:45	nuthulu	Justin did you see the sort of interview video they did with him
2013-02-01 07:44:53	GarthAlgar	vanu won on most servers due to the amount of players they have
2013-02-01 07:44:56	nuthulu	He looks like he's going to fucking die from lack of sleep
2013-02-01 07:45:03	GarthAlgar	and then it was all about a stupid facebook vote?
2013-02-01 07:45:05	Justin	nuthulu: I didn't
2013-02-01 07:45:16	Justin	GarthAlgar: You mean "who do you think won?"
2013-02-01 07:45:27	Justin	also why was everyone on VS
2013-02-01 07:45:38	GarthAlgar	no idea, people like to play vanu for some reason
2013-02-01 07:45:39	Justin	I'm pretty sure the VS is the least popular faction
2013-02-01 07:45:44	Justin	oh really?
2013-02-01 07:45:54	GarthAlgar	probably cause they have magriders and scythes and shit
2013-02-01 07:45:56	Justin	idk but I find the TR the most populated
2013-02-01 07:45:57	Justin	most of the time
2013-02-01 07:46:16	GarthAlgar	during the event, it was like 52% vanu on amerish on our server
2013-02-01 07:46:18	@Makrond	Vanu has the most people across all servers
2013-02-01 07:46:28	@Makrond	well actually no that's not true
2013-02-01 07:46:30	@Makrond	NC does
2013-02-01 07:46:36	GarthAlgar	and they didn't even reset the damn map
2013-02-01 07:46:39	@Makrond	but the Vanu have the most active playerbase
2013-02-01 07:46:49	GarthAlgar	so it  began with vanu controlling almost everything except one area right next to the TR warpgate

2013-02-01 17:30:37	@Makrond	there's a reason they measure blood alcohol and not breath alcohol :P

2013-02-01 17:31:04	GarthAlgar	and if you fail that test, they go for blood

2013-02-01 17:31:35	GarthAlgar	though they can't really force you to do it, cause of drawing blood and shit
2013-02-01 17:31:45	GarthAlgar	but if you refuse it, you kind of fuck yourself over anyway
2013-02-01 17:31:49	@Makrond	the more accurate test here is just a second breath test
2013-02-01 17:31:53	@Makrond	not a blood test
2013-02-01 17:32:24	@Makrond	because y'know pathology labs have better things to be doing than testing drunk assholes

2013-02-01 17:33:49	BW	naw, they're just short on labs
2013-02-01 17:34:05	@Makrond	my point was just that inhaling alcohol won't change your BAC% after all the alcohol's been absorbed
2013-02-01 17:34:26	@Makrond	GarthAlgar: man we don't even need all that much, it's just that pathology takes ages to get anything done
2013-02-01 17:34:30	@Makrond	so they always have a backlog
2013-02-01 17:35:07	RPharazon|NB	Yes

2013-02-01 17:36:14	RPharazon|NB	Due to quicker alcohol intake
2013-02-01 17:36:16	@Makrond	no sorry, he said it would set them off easier
2013-02-01 17:36:24	BW	well, if you did it immediately before using one, i suppose ;P
2013-02-01 17:36:26	RPharazon|NB	Say if a police car busted through the wall of your meth lab
2013-02-01 17:36:31	RPharazon|NB	And immediately tested your breath
2013-02-01 17:36:44	GarthAlgar	you also set of a breathalyzer quicker if you used mouthwash
2013-02-01 17:36:47	BW	(they actually make you wait a few minutes before having you use one, iirc)
2013-02-01 17:36:53	GarthAlgar	i am not sure this is super relevant x)

2013-02-01 17:37:18	@Makrond	at best
2013-02-01 17:37:48	GarthAlgar	mouthwash still messes with breath alcohol analysis
2013-02-01 17:38:06	@Makrond	hell I'm on a 0-tolerance licence and by the time they'd gotten me into the bus to do the second breath test I'd be 0.00%
2013-02-01 17:38:30	GarthAlgar	well yeah, the effect doesn't last long
2013-02-01 17:38:39	GarthAlgar	but if they had a control point right at your street, it could matter
2013-02-01 17:39:21	Afthartos	Makrond: when i was kid, the driver for school taxi got taken away by police because he blew enough into the analyser. heard later that it was a false positive because of cough medicine. but he still was taken for blood tests. we had to walk rest of the way to school that morning
2013-02-01 17:39:44	GarthAlgar	sounds like a win
2013-02-01 17:39:54	GarthAlgar	unless you didn't miss a shitty class

2013-02-01 17:41:33	@Makrond	I'm not talking about the handheld breathalysers though
2013-02-01 17:41:53	GarthAlgar	it's so rare that you get into a situation where you failed an initial breath test
2013-02-01 17:42:00	GarthAlgar	i don't think blood tests are that bad then
2013-02-01 17:42:06	@Makrond	actually it happens all the time
2013-02-01 17:42:23	@Makrond	at least here
2013-02-01 17:42:34	@Makrond	because y'know your body metabolises alcohol pretty quick
2013-02-01 17:42:52	GarthAlgar	i don't have a drivers license
2013-02-01 17:42:53	GarthAlgar	or a car
2013-02-01 17:42:56	@Makrond	so in the 10-20 minutes between the initial roadside test and the more accurate second test you can fall 2 points
2013-02-01 17:42:57	GarthAlgar	so, it doesn't really matter
2013-02-01 17:43:07	@Makrond	0.02% that is

2013-02-02 01:01:45	Thundercraft	It's been a while since I played DF. Does the recent version still have the same problem with the drop in Framerate in late game?
2013-02-02 01:02:32	Thundercraft	With all the Nightcreatures, towns, and added features, I would suspect that it's worse than ever now...
2013-02-02 01:03:02	Trifase	I thing that depends on your machine.
2013-02-02 01:03:09	Trifase	I never had a framerate problem in my life.
2013-02-02 01:03:51	Thundercraft	It also depends on things like embark size and how much stuff (trade goods, etc) is on your map.

2013-02-02 01:05:04	Thundercraft	I've heard that the it keeps track of everything, even bloodsplatter and grime, FOREVER. That is, even after the stuff is sold or destroyed.
2013-02-02 01:05:17	namad7	yeah really i'd say almost every computer that everyone has in this chatroom can run df, ya know either you have to embark 2x2 or you can embark 8x8
2013-02-02 01:05:31	Trifase	Some say..
2013-02-02 01:05:34	namad7	i'm pretty sure when something is cleaned up it's cleaned up, it's just that things are so rarely cleaned up
2013-02-02 01:06:52	Thundercraft	I don't doubt that DF will run on practically any computer. But, on older machines at least, there are cases where it runs really slow late in a Fortress Mode embark.
2013-02-02 01:07:07	Trifase	That depends on your concept of 'older'
2013-02-02 01:07:16	Thundercraft	I was mostly wondering if the latest release was any worse or better in that regard.
2013-02-02 01:07:31	Essence13	this laptop runs a 2x2 embark, year 5, at 10-40 avg fps
2013-02-02 01:07:31	Trifase	I think it will be always the same
2013-02-02 01:08:34	Thundercraft	Right now i'm using a 7+ year old laptop with a 2 Ghz Centrino. That's kinda "old".
2013-02-02 01:09:02	Essence13	sigh.  crashed. lost tons of work
2013-02-02 01:09:18	Trifase	That's very old.
2013-02-02 01:10:18	Essence13	this laptop is borrowed, so no idea how old. But it's 1.86Ghz celeron with Vista
2013-02-02 01:10:37	Thundercraft	Anyway, I'd definitely consider 10 fps to be pretty darned slow.
2013-02-02 01:11:12	Thundercraft	And a 2x2 embark is quite small.
2013-02-02 01:11:57	Essence13	there's no way I could run bigger and hope to play into a late game on this.
2013-02-02 01:12:15	Trifase	I remember when CPUs had pins on them.
2013-02-02 01:12:21	Thundercraft	Due to the framerate, or due to another reason?
2013-02-02 01:12:25	Trifase	Hell, i even remember when CPUs had slots.
2013-02-02 01:12:31	Essence13	but I just picked up on the game a couple of weeks ago. learning. once my new desktop is running I think I'll be fine
2013-02-02 01:12:50	Trifase	And they were called simply Slot 1.
2013-02-02 01:13:31	FFLaguna	Is that the Trifase from the Legand of Zalda series?
2013-02-02 01:13:47	Essence13	Trifase: hah.  I think I still have a pentium 2 cartridge in a box somewhere.
2013-02-02 01:14:31	Thundercraft	In my basement I have a "Bouroughs" computer that dates to about 1980 or 81. The 40 MB hard drive on this thing is about the size of an average desktop today. And it weighs more than a typical 15" CRT monitor. :D
2013-02-02 01:14:39	Essence13	was it pentium 2?  kinda like a 2/3 size NES game cartridge
2013-02-02 01:15:34	Thundercraft	Oh, and it has a HUGE floppy drive. The disks are about 8.5 or 9 inches across
2013-02-02 01:15:59	Trifase	Yes, the Penium II was slot socket based.
2013-02-02 01:16:02	Trifase	Ehr, PenTium.
2013-02-02 01:16:05	Dasleah	i've got a huge floppy for you right here
2013-02-02 01:16:24	Essence13	I had my 8088s until I recycled them 2 years ago.  5Mb hard drive.  and yeah, huge drives.  the case by itself weighed about 10lbs.
2013-02-02 01:16:30	Essence13	just the metal box
2013-02-02 01:16:56	Trifase	8088s were socket based
2013-02-02 01:17:04	Trifase	PII was slot based, like a PCI card

2013-02-02 05:48:49	Justin	I'm surprised this wasn't taken down yet
2013-02-02 05:49:59	GarthAlgar	nintendo would have to do something about that
2013-02-02 05:50:10	GarthAlgar	and they are extremely clueless about this fancy new internet thing :P
2013-02-02 05:52:16	GarthAlgar	it seems that developer likes making clones in general ._.
2013-02-02 05:52:41	G-Flex	it's kind of hard to go after people for trademark/copyright infringement when it comes to things ilke that
2013-02-02 05:53:12	Justin	and charging for them, too
2013-02-02 05:53:37	Justin	G-Flex: Pretty sure those graphics were ripped off Advance Wars
2013-02-02 05:53:43	Justin	it's not like they made their own versions of the sprites either
2013-02-02 05:54:22	Justin	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.mapp.yushae#
2013-02-02 05:54:42	Justin	I wonder how many of these sprites were ripped off Dragon Quest
2013-02-02 05:55:48	Justin	G-Flex: What's the problem, though?
2013-02-02 05:57:26	G-Flex	oh, if the graphics are ripped off that's another thing
2013-02-02 05:57:37	G-Flex	like, it's a lot easier to sue for that if actual content was ripped
2013-02-02 05:57:50	G-Flex	but it's harder to prosecute based on a game simply being very similar
2013-02-02 06:03:36	Justin	yeah
2013-02-02 06:03:51	Justin	the graphics were ripped off
2013-02-02 06:04:04	Justin	so I was kind of confused by your statement saying that it's hard to sue them at first
2013-02-02 06:04:23	Justin	I don't even think that suing a game being very similar is a good idea, anyway
2013-02-02 06:04:33	Justin	if all the actual work was done by the copycats
2013-02-02 06:04:57	Justin	however if you're able to prove that the copycats directly copied an asset from your game
2013-02-02 06:05:04	Justin	then there shouldn't be any trouble
2013-02-02 06:05:23	Justin	I also love how the link says "warsue"
2013-02-02 06:06:17	G-Flex	define "actual work"
2013-02-02 06:06:22	G-Flex	plenty of work goes into design
2013-02-02 06:06:22	Justin	also the custom-made artwork are also hilariously out of place
2013-02-02 06:06:28	Justin	G-Flex: I mean, work on assets
2013-02-02 06:06:50	Justin	like graphics and code
2013-02-02 06:07:48	Justin	also poor sods are letting apps turning them into spambots on facebook
2013-02-02 06:09:17	Justin	also that national review article slamming obama for calling the holocaust "senseless"
2013-02-02 06:09:34	Justin	well the Great Ronald Ray Gun said

2013-02-02 08:16:44	sandbox	there are no games for it
2013-02-02 08:17:42	BW	ps3 has NO GAEMS
2013-02-02 08:17:45	sandbox	the 3DS had a slow start but recovered
2013-02-02 08:18:06	BW	sandbox: anything on that worth playing yet?
2013-02-02 08:19:04	GarthAlgar	i kinda want one
2013-02-02 08:19:14	GarthAlgar	but i hate the regionlock bullshit, so i still didn't bite
2013-02-02 08:19:24	BW	and by 'anything' i mean ' what is'
2013-02-02 08:19:31	Justin	yeah 3DS had such a slow start that nintendo dropped the price for it so hard
2013-02-02 08:19:43	Justin	even the XL's cheaper than the launch price for the 3DS :V
2013-02-02 08:19:52	GarthAlgar	also, one of the games i kind of care about seems to be better on vita in a few ways... like, not having a critical bug that wipes your savegame
2013-02-02 08:20:05	GarthAlgar	which you only have a single one of on the 3DS, because nintendo is stuck in 1980
2013-02-02 08:20:07	BW	GarthAlgar: mere trivialities!
2013-02-02 08:22:29	Justin	also SEGA Japan is a massive dick
2013-02-02 08:22:35	GarthAlgar	i read that the XL top screen still gets scratched by the lower part of the console? the added bumpers aren't enough? :/
2013-02-02 08:22:37	Justin	and is banning people for Shining Force LPs
2013-02-02 08:22:43	Justin	and taking down their videos
2013-02-02 08:22:59	GarthAlgar	well, technically they are in the right about LP videos
2013-02-02 08:23:09	Justin	I'll probably wait for the next version of the 3DS
2013-02-02 08:23:11	GarthAlgar	but no need to ban people :/
2013-02-02 08:23:35	GarthAlgar	also, sega japan is still infinitely better than sega of america
2013-02-02 08:24:51	Justin	why
2013-02-02 08:24:54	Justin	what did SEGA of America do?
2013-02-02 08:25:06	GarthAlgar	they never do anything for games that aren't sonic
2013-02-02 08:26:01	GarthAlgar	except once, they wasted tons of money on big name voice actors for yakuza 1, that tanked and then they silently released the sequel with zero marketing and used the pretty shitty sales as a reason for ignoring the third for ages
2013-02-02 08:27:18	Justin	I see...
2013-02-02 08:28:48	GarthAlgar	not sure why they thought it was a good idea to do a pretty bad english dub for a game that lives from the whole japanese atmosphere going on :/
2013-02-02 08:29:32	-->	ussdefiant_ (~chatzilla@NewNet-11BD6CBB.ed.shawcable.net) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-02 08:29:49	Justin	I don't understand dubs in general
2013-02-02 08:30:11	Justin	well, for games that rely on the language to add to the setting
2013-02-02 08:30:24	Justin	(for example, an English dub on a Japanese game set in Japan feels really weird)
2013-02-02 08:31:56	GarthAlgar	because americans don't like subtitles
2013-02-02 08:32:07	GarthAlgar	they rather wait for movies to get an US remake than watch it with subs
2013-02-02 08:32:23	GarthAlgar	(generally speaking, obviously not true for every single american... ;)
2013-02-02 08:32:37	BW	americans? read?
2013-02-02 08:32:39	BW	HAH
2013-02-02 08:32:50	Justin	also it doesn't help that handheld console games are also really, really expensive
2013-02-02 08:33:01	sandbox	BW: I dunno I don't have either
2013-02-02 08:33:01	Justin	which might put me off buying an actual handheld console
2013-02-02 08:33:17	GarthAlgar	yeah, kind of sucks that iOS/android games killed the prices people accept
2013-02-02 08:33:19	BW	sandbox: oh :(
2013-02-02 08:33:32	Justin	a 3DS game costs as much as an average home console
2013-02-02 08:33:36	Justin	game
2013-02-02 08:33:43	Justin	GarthAlgar: Indeed
2013-02-02 08:33:50	Justin	I'm way too used to the pricing on android games
2013-02-02 08:33:54	Justin	obviously the quality is lower
2013-02-02 08:33:59	Justin	but the price is just way cheaper
2013-02-02 08:34:10	BW	and the control input is near-universally shit
2013-02-02 08:34:24	Justin	well not if you have physical buttons on a phone
2013-02-02 08:34:31	Justin	but yes, touch controls are almost always shit
2013-02-02 08:35:05	Justin	it's just that I don't think I want to splurge a lot of money on a handheld game
2013-02-02 08:35:15	Justin	I don't see myself spending as much time on a handheld than on my PC
2013-02-02 08:36:10	GarthAlgar	i like how easily you can play DS games in bed, kind of harder with PC games
2013-02-02 08:36:57	sandbox	the PSP was good for when I was on a train 5 hours every a week
2013-02-02 08:37:00	Justin	nah I don't play in bed
2013-02-02 08:37:02	sandbox	-a
2013-02-02 08:37:13	GarthAlgar	hehehehehe
2013-02-02 08:37:22	Justin	also handheld games SHOULD be cheaper anyway
2013-02-02 08:37:24	sandbox	"play in bed" that was the sims
2013-02-02 08:37:28	Justin	lower quality graphics
2013-02-02 08:37:31	Justin	etc
2013-02-02 08:38:00	sandbox	yeah, I object to the insane pricing
2013-02-02 08:38:15	sandbox	£35 for a DS game pffft
2013-02-02 08:38:27	GarthAlgar	let me check 3DS prices on amazon, i have no idea what they go for, tbh
2013-02-02 08:38:49	Justin	yeah at this rate I don't think I'll ever buy a handheld console
2013-02-02 08:39:16	GarthAlgar	okay, they have insane prices o_o
2013-02-02 08:39:20	Justin	I think smartphone gaming will eventually reach the quality of the consoles
2013-02-02 08:39:25	GarthAlgar	50€ for paper mario?
2013-02-02 08:39:45	sandbox	is that what it is?
2013-02-02 08:39:53	GarthAlgar	i don't pay that much for ps3 games, i don't pay that much for PC games, why would i do so for a 3ds game? >_<
2013-02-02 08:40:53	RPharazon|NB	Justin, considering that consoles are using hardware from 2004, I would not be surprised
2013-02-02 08:41:06	RPharazon|NB	With the new batch of consoles, they're using hardware from 2010
2013-02-02 08:41:17	Justin	hell
2013-02-02 08:41:27	Justin	many PC games use cutting edge technology
2013-02-02 08:41:33	Justin	and are priced cheaper than any other console games
2013-02-02 08:41:43	Justin	well perhaps "many" is inaccurate
2013-02-02 08:41:48	Justin	"several" would be better
2013-02-02 08:41:57	Justin	damn multiplatform releases, get out of my lawn!!! D:
2013-02-02 08:42:09	RPharazon|NB	Heh
2013-02-02 08:42:17	GarthAlgar	meh, on PC you also have less costs... no royalties to pay to the platform holder
2013-02-02 08:42:20	RPharazon|NB	I think that Modern Warfare 2 is still like $50 on Steam
2013-02-02 08:42:21	Justin	yeah
2013-02-02 08:42:31	Justin	PC is "pay more upfront, enjoy more for less in the long run"
2013-02-02 08:42:52	GarthAlgar	same paper mario on shopto is 30 pound... still not super cheap, but way more reasonable ._.
2013-02-02 08:43:15	Justin	also smartphones have better hardware than consoles anyway
2013-02-02 08:43:29	Justin	well except for the GPU and CPU
2013-02-02 08:43:36	GarthAlgar	or the whole buttons thing
2013-02-02 08:43:37	RPharazon|NB	Cawd4 is still $20
2013-02-02 08:43:37	Justin	but they're getting there pretty soon
2013-02-02 08:43:46	RPharazon|NB	Cawd4:2 is still $20
2013-02-02 08:43:48	Justin	GarthAlgar: Well buttons can be added any time
2013-02-02 08:43:50	RPharazon|NB	Cawd4:3 is still $60
2013-02-02 08:44:00	Justin	But heh
2013-02-02 08:44:01	Justin	the RAM
2013-02-02 08:44:01	RPharazon|NB	Cawd4:3's DLC packs are still $15/each
2013-02-02 08:44:17	Justin	a smartphone can have 4 times the RAM of the xbox 360 and PS3 consoles
2013-02-02 08:44:20	Justin	what a shame
2013-02-02 08:45:02	Justin	anyway smartphones have a lot of the characteristics of the PC
2013-02-02 08:45:05	Justin	it's more open
2013-02-02 08:45:11	Justin	it's multipurpose
2013-02-02 08:45:15	Justin	games on it are cheap
2013-02-02 08:45:21	Justin	it's more expensive in general
2013-02-02 08:45:24	Justin	hardware's better
2013-02-02 08:45:24	GarthAlgar	sadly enough also cheaply made :P
2013-02-02 08:45:28	Justin	it has variety
2013-02-02 08:45:31	Justin	GarthAlgar: Yeah
2013-02-02 08:45:46	Justin	then again any developer can develop for the android easily enough
2013-02-02 08:45:47	GarthAlgar	and the hardware thing is problematic, because you can't really make use of it... there's too many different devices out there and you don'T wanna lock out anyone
2013-02-02 08:45:52	Justin	yeah
2013-02-02 08:45:57	Justin	the same problem with the PC, basically
2013-02-02 08:46:01	Justin	hence why it's like the PC
2013-02-02 08:46:04	RPharazon|NB	Cheaply made and is largely replaced in a year, Justin
2013-02-02 08:46:07	RPharazon|NB	No modularity either
2013-02-02 08:46:09	Justin	the same problems and benefits of a PC

2013-02-02 08:46:51	RPharazon|NB	Pocket PCs haven't gained traction at all in the past decade or so

2013-02-02 13:55:19	Soadreqm	Boulders are really heavy and hard to carry now, so you'll actually want to use those wheelbarrows.
2013-02-02 13:55:43	bones	minecarts seem pretty complicated
2013-02-02 13:55:50	bones	just judging by the wiki
2013-02-02 13:56:00	Soadreqm	To compensate for the reduced amount of rock and ore you'll have, you now get more bars or blocks per raw stone.
2013-02-02 13:56:58	Soadreqm	Yeah, they have a lot of steps to get them working. I think they're cool, but you won't really need them if you don't feel like bothering with it.

2013-02-02 14:21:52	Soadreqm	And the door is closed so I can't even run away.
2013-02-02 14:21:53	Soadreqm	Thanks, Meridia.
2013-02-02 14:29:33	Soadreqm	I suppose I'll just utilise what tactics are available in this small hallway I have.
2013-02-02 14:30:08	Soadreqm	Snipe the wizard with a bow, sneakily sneak away, wait for him to lose interest, repeat.

2013-02-02 14:33:55	Soadreqm	I hope it's an exhaustible supply of potions, and not a spell he can use forever.
2013-02-02 14:38:47	Soadreqm	YESSS! The wizard crept up to me, but I snuck past it with a potion of invisibility and managed to find a sniper perch in the larger hall.
2013-02-02 14:39:51	Soadreqm	The AI of the ghost things couldn't quite deal with being unable to reach me, so they just flailed about below me and didn't even see me properly.
2013-02-02 14:39:54	Soadreqm	I shot them all to death.
2013-02-02 14:40:03	Soadreqm	Now the mage should be easier to deal with.

2013-02-02 14:47:09	Soadreqm	Well, I killed that too, by flailing at it while popping potions like crazy.
2013-02-02 14:47:21	Soadreqm	His ghost had more money on it than his body.

2013-02-02 16:11:44	RPharazon|NB	It feels like cheating
2013-02-02 16:11:58	RPharazon|NB	At least, when doing things within 0-10

2013-02-02 16:12:52	Kidiri	A wind triangle circular hand calculator?
2013-02-02 16:13:49	RPharazon|NB	Yes
2013-02-02 16:13:58	RPharazon|NB	It's a slide rule
2013-02-02 16:14:06	RPharazon|NB	With a wind triangle apparatus on the opposite side

2013-02-02 16:15:18	RPharazon|NB	One of these
2013-02-02 16:15:23	RPharazon|NB	I have one right next to me
2013-02-02 16:15:25	RPharazon|NB	Insanely handy
2013-02-02 16:15:39	Kidiri	Seems insanely complicated.
2013-02-02 16:15:43	RPharazon|NB	The slide rule face lets you do so many things
2013-02-02 16:15:56	RPharazon|NB	It looks complicated but it's not
2013-02-02 16:16:22	RPharazon|NB	And it's still a logarithmic slide rule so you can quickly multiply, divide, square root, and do logarithmic functions on things
2013-02-02 16:16:27	RPharazon|NB	Within a certain margin of error of course
2013-02-02 16:16:34	RPharazon|NB	And logical thinking about where to apply the decimal point
2013-02-02 16:17:23	Kidiri	I prefer an actual calculator.
2013-02-02 16:17:36	RPharazon|NB	This is a calculator
2013-02-02 16:17:43	Kidiri	But then again, you probably won't have time to do all that shit while in flight.
2013-02-02 16:17:47	RPharazon|NB	It's the standard aviation calculator snice the 30s
2013-02-02 16:17:48	Kidiri	A digital calculator.
2013-02-02 16:17:52	RPharazon|NB	And yes, you do have time to do all that shit in flight
2013-02-02 16:18:09	RPharazon|NB	In fact, using one of these is required for even the most basic pilot's license
2013-02-02 16:18:20	Kidiri	I meant using a digital calculator
2013-02-02 16:18:25	RPharazon|NB	As in, they test you on its use both in the written exams and in the flight tests
2013-02-02 16:18:34	RPharazon|NB	Well
2013-02-02 16:18:39	Kidiri	I can quite understand that you use this tool
2013-02-02 16:18:41	RPharazon|NB	You can bring a digital one to the written exams
2013-02-02 16:18:42	Kidiri	Because it's faster
2013-02-02 16:18:57	RPharazon|NB	And to the basic flight exam, but the commercial level and above requires use of the slide rule
2013-02-02 16:19:40	Dasleah	you know just in case of emp blast or something so you can't use electronic calculators!
2013-02-02 16:19:50	RPharazon|NB	Think more basic
2013-02-02 16:19:54	RPharazon|NB	In case your batteries run out
2013-02-02 16:19:57	Dasleah	whooosh
2013-02-02 16:20:17	RPharazon|NB	My old flight instructor always made his students tape a spare set of batteries to the digital calculator case for written exams
2013-02-02 16:20:34	RPharazon|NB	If he didn't see those spare batteries, he'd take your calculator away for the exam
2013-02-02 16:22:27	RPharazon|NB	The best thing about circular (and regular) slide rules is that they make certain equations really easy
2013-02-02 16:22:36	RPharazon|NB	Usually in the format of x/y = m/n
2013-02-02 16:22:51	RPharazon|NB	Usually you'd write it out and simplify, then calculate
2013-02-02 16:23:11	RPharazon|NB	Here you simply match up x and y on the slide rule circles, find m, and get n directly opposite m
2013-02-02 16:24:00	RPharazon|NB	Like, for example, 30/2 = 60/x
2013-02-02 16:24:31	RPharazon|NB	Match up 30 with a 2 or 20, then find 60 on the 30 circle, you see a 40
2013-02-02 16:24:37	RPharazon|NB	Use your brain a bit and you get 4
2013-02-02 16:24:46	RPharazon|NB	Simple example, but you get my point
2013-02-02 16:25:28	RPharazon|NB	A lot of equations are in that x/y = m/n format, at least in aviation
2013-02-02 16:25:52	RPharazon|NB	Such as weight shifts, wind shifts, finding the point of no return, your bingo fuel point, etc
2013-02-02 16:31:27	Kidiri	Oh damn
2013-02-02 16:31:34	Kidiri	My cat is going insane again.

2013-02-02 17:34:45	Spekkio	well I just googled irssi and glanced at the page and the top post included the phrase "windows installer"
2013-02-02 17:34:53	Spekkio	so I have 0 information on shitosity
2013-02-02 17:35:08	GarthAlgar	it's IRC in your terminal

2013-02-02 17:35:23	heph	Instasll irsi on a server (or you fritzbox) and then use putty to use it :P
2013-02-02 17:35:25	GarthAlgar	which explains the shittyness of it on windows
2013-02-02 17:35:43	GarthAlgar	i contemplated switching to irssi after flashing my router

2013-02-02 17:53:24	Boometh	Instantbird is good for students, anyways. :P
2013-02-02 17:53:48	Boometh	It's a program that was meant to be used as a messenger for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, MSN, etc. But it has IRC capabilities.
2013-02-02 17:54:28	TWA	the website says it connects to MSN Messenger (instantbird) which doesn't exist anymore, so thats cool? haha
2013-02-02 17:54:44	Boometh	Isn't it, like, Windows Live or something now?
2013-02-02 17:54:52	TWA	Its skype
2013-02-02 17:54:54	Boometh	I figured everyone just used Skype at this point.
2013-02-02 17:55:40	TWA	yeah, MSN was discontented , those who didn't have Skype were told to get it, and login (MSN names work on Skype or some madness, idk)

2013-02-02 18:26:04	TWA	I have, but to a dwarf, I feel like that would be considered a waste of alcohol, as it takes the 'alcohol' out of it?
2013-02-02 18:26:20	Boometh	Maybe the wine is the sauce?
2013-02-02 18:27:08	TWA	haha, not cooked, just like, a  pot filled with wine and some elk steak in it
2013-02-02 18:29:49	Boometh	Or maybe it's alcohol soup.

2013-02-02 20:23:19	Spekkio	I would explain it
2013-02-02 20:23:27	Spekkio	but it's kinda hard to sum up
2013-02-02 20:23:52	Boometh	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichamber <-- This?
2013-02-02 20:24:08	Spekkio	yes
2013-02-02 20:24:58	Spekkio	Some reviews talk about it screwing with your head and taking you out of your comfort zone, but that's just not my experience. I guess I don't have so much of a problem with non-euclidean space?
2013-02-02 20:26:39	RPharazon|NB	We live in non-euclidian space
2013-02-02 20:26:46	RPharazon|NB	We live on an oblate spheroid
2013-02-02 20:26:56	RPharazon|NB	We can draw a triangle with three right angles upon the surface of the earth
2013-02-02 20:27:06	Boometh	I don't know what that is, and the Wikipedia article for that is confusing and has stuffy language.
2013-02-02 20:28:34	Spekkio	Basically the game is about using all the tools at your disposal to solve a large number of puzzles which vary in form. For example pretty early in the game there's a number of pits
2013-02-02 20:28:45	Spekkio	and it suggests you jump over one
2013-02-02 20:28:48	Spekkio	and if you do, you fall.
2013-02-02 20:29:06	Spekkio	when you try again, if you just walk, blocks appear under your feet
2013-02-02 20:29:23	Boometh	 That's beautiful level design there. >_>
2013-02-02 20:30:02	Spekkio	it would be a pain if that kind of thing was an unexpected obstacle between you and some other, stated challenge of the game
2013-02-02 20:30:53	Spekkio	but that's basically what the game is about. Rise above the strange complex that you're in for no apparent reason

2013-02-02 20:38:16	Spekkio	Have beds before bedrooms, everything inside before distinct stockpiles. Farms just need to be producing food before other sources run out, so the real question is... how much did you pack?
2013-02-02 20:39:19	Boometh	Well to be honest, the real problem here is that there's piles of various stones lying around that my dwarves won't clean up very quickly.

2013-02-02 20:50:32	TWA	just make stockpiles for them if they are specific, and you need them close at hand, like marble, or other flux materials

2013-02-02 20:55:51	TWA	in this case, a decorated bolt
2013-02-02 20:56:44	TWA	but you can decorate bolts, though it is profitable
2013-02-02 20:58:29	Spekkio	The onnly reason I'd decorate a bolt is to sell it

2013-02-02 20:59:04	TWA	right, but I didn't decorate this one, the caravan accompanying my liaison to the mountain homes did
2013-02-02 20:59:13	TWA	no goblins on this map

2013-02-02 21:02:06	Spekkio	At first it used to be stone crafts, then I went to stone mugs (but they're too cheap hauled individually and too heavy when filling a barrel, and also useless), then most recently it's stone mechanisms
2013-02-02 21:02:10	Spekkio	At least mechanisms have a use.
2013-02-02 21:02:36	Spekkio	only problem there is that I need to hide my mechanic's workshop from the traders

2013-02-03 06:36:54	sandbox	just curious
2013-02-03 06:37:12	sandbox	do things look blown-up?
2013-02-03 06:37:18	Justin	Now I need to find out how to have Big Picture on the TV
2013-02-03 06:37:19	Justin	no
2013-02-03 06:37:24	Justin	the video's pretty crisp, actually
2013-02-03 06:37:49	Justin	it's not pixelated at all
2013-02-03 06:37:49	sandbox	don't you just press "Big Picture"?
2013-02-03 06:37:53	Justin	yeah
2013-02-03 06:37:57	Justin	but it shows up ON MY MONITOR
2013-02-03 06:38:13	sandbox	you know they made the Big Picture button smaller
2013-02-03 06:38:24	Justin	yeah
2013-02-03 06:38:26	Justin	I noticed that
2013-02-03 06:38:27	Justin	http://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture/setup
2013-02-03 06:38:37	Justin	according to this the HDMI cable carries both audio and video
2013-02-03 06:39:11	Justin	well that definitely saves on cost and space :D
2013-02-03 06:39:42	sandbox	we've only got an old vga cable and separate audio cables but it gets the job done for hooking up our laptops
2013-02-03 06:40:30	Justin	"Razers Onza is also one that works well with Steam."
2013-02-03 06:40:34	Justin	This is the controller I use :D
2013-02-03 06:40:34	Justin	:)
2013-02-03 06:40:53	Justin	sandbox: But it doesn't look as crisp as mine, I'll bet
2013-02-03 06:41:48	sandbox	I've always thought crisp was a strange word for describing picture quality ;p
2013-02-03 06:41:50	Justin	holy shit

2013-02-03 09:32:07	Malachite	i havent checked yet
2013-02-03 09:32:41	Malachite	Theodore Beale
2013-02-03 09:33:36	Malachite	im just glad someone important is winning
2013-02-03 09:33:56	AfterShave	I knew who neither of those are actually
2013-02-03 09:34:10	AfterShave	I'm looking up this Beale person's blog right now
2013-02-03 09:35:47	AfterShave	" Science, the profession, is increasingly at war with the evidence presented by science, the method. It is not religion that poses a dire threat to science, but rather the dogmatic pseudo-science of academia and the media, which is more authoritarian, more close-minded, more sensitive and more dangerous than any religious leader, past or present."
2013-02-03 09:36:46	AfterShave	Science isn't open minded now? I thought it usually is
2013-02-03 09:41:34	Calzu	there have always been real problems in academia about new inventions vs oldshcool dogmatic approach.  but really far from stupid religious bullshit still
2013-02-03 09:42:17	Malachite	i told my mom i wanted to do science
2013-02-03 09:42:19	AfterShave	I mean, at first stuff is opposed
2013-02-03 09:42:27	Malachite	and that was the explanation i used to tell her why i couldn't
2013-02-03 09:42:30	AfterShave	"That shit can't be true!" *gump*
2013-02-03 09:42:39	AfterShave	But then a while after they test it and see it's actually true
2013-02-03 09:42:42	AfterShave	Or not
2013-02-03 09:42:53	RPharazon|NB	Dude
2013-02-03 09:43:00	Malachite	anything can be true, but only after rigorous investigation
2013-02-03 09:43:01	AfterShave	I mean *grump*
2013-02-03 09:43:04	RPharazon|NB	It can take decades before a scientific theory can be accepted
2013-02-03 09:43:10	AfterShave	"a while"
2013-02-03 09:43:13	RPharazon|NB	Plate tectonics took about 40 years to be accepted
2013-02-03 09:43:55	AfterShave	See, just one generation
2013-02-03 09:44:01	AfterShave	I'd say in technology that's just a while :P
2013-02-03 09:44:05	RPharazon|NB	The competing theory at the time was land bridges between continents, even though those land bridges had to cover the entire ocean, and didn't explain anything about earthquakes or tectonic faults
2013-02-03 09:44:15	RPharazon|NB	40 years against a stupid, inane idea
2013-02-03 09:44:29	RPharazon|NB	And you know when that was?
2013-02-03 09:44:42	RPharazon|NB	Plate tectonics was only really accepted in the late 60s
2013-02-03 09:45:39	AfterShave	I was going to guess late 19th century
2013-02-03 09:48:00	RPharazon|NB	The big problem is that academia -eventually- sees reason
2013-02-03 09:48:09	RPharazon|NB	But it's not overnight and it's not even on the scale of years
2013-02-03 09:48:15	RPharazon|NB	It's on the scale of decades
2013-02-03 09:49:34	Malachite	but that could be a good thing, because then every idea is subjected to the scrutiny that it may or may not deserve
2013-02-03 09:50:12	RPharazon|NB	It could be a very bad thing because it holds back scientific progress by decades.
2013-02-03 09:50:25	Calzu	a real trategy for some great minds. only getting their due respect after being dead for a long while
2013-02-03 09:50:52	RPharazon|NB	Like people who never win the Nobel Prize because they died a few years or even a few decades after their breakthroughs
2013-02-03 09:50:55	Malachite	i should probably give this topic a great deal more thought before i dive right in
2013-02-03 09:51:00	RPharazon|NB	Yes
2013-02-03 09:51:02	RPharazon|NB	You should.

2013-02-03 09:56:46	AfterShave	I'm actually almost reading what I should study right now
2013-02-03 09:56:48	AfterShave	Almost
2013-02-03 09:57:07	RPharazon|NB	By most historical accounts of the era, even anti-Nero ones, he actually helped organize a lot of the firefighting efforts
2013-02-03 09:57:30	sandbox	and the fiddle hadn't been invented at the time
2013-02-03 09:57:37	 *	AfterShave can not history
2013-02-03 09:57:39	RPharazon|NB	The idea that Nero fiddled while Rome burned was due largely to a poem or play in the late 19th century, I believe
2013-02-03 09:57:51	RPharazon|NB	Either that or something by Shakespeare
2013-02-03 09:57:54	RPharazon|NB	It's always Shakespeare
2013-02-03 09:57:56	RPharazon|NB	That looter of history
2013-02-03 09:58:00	 *	Malachite can not history either
2013-02-03 09:58:17	AfterShave	I know like, there lived vikings here once upon a time
2013-02-03 09:58:24	AfterShave	And they had merchants
2013-02-03 09:58:26	AfterShave	:P
2013-02-03 09:59:24	RPharazon|NB	Russia got its name from the viking merchants who lived along Russia's rivers and traded with the Byzantine Empire around the 900s and 1000s
2013-02-03 09:59:39	Malachite	yea, i definately wouldnt have known that
2013-02-03 09:59:42	RPharazon|NB	It was quite lucrative and you could even join the Varangian Guard if you got bored
2013-02-03 10:01:04	AfterShave	I remember reading that the varangian guard was basically the emperor's personal drunks
2013-02-03 10:01:07	AfterShave	For how much they drank
2013-02-03 10:01:17	AfterShave	I don't know if this is true, but considering northerners. Probably is
2013-02-03 10:01:35	RPharazon|NB	They were basically elite Viking guardsmen for the Byzantine Emperor
2013-02-03 10:01:38	Malachite	AfterShave: i could probably apply. someone introduced me to vodka just recently
2013-02-03 10:01:54	AfterShave	Vodka, I hope you're not drinking it neat
2013-02-03 10:01:58	RPharazon|NB	There was actually a quota on how many there were because they had tons of Vikings going down to Constantinople trying to join up
2013-02-03 10:01:59	AfterShave	It tastes oh so bad
2013-02-03 10:02:11	Malachite	it does. until you cant taste it anymore
2013-02-03 10:02:19	RPharazon|NB	Vikings were actually quite numerous around the Aegean and Black Sea from the 800s-1100s
2013-02-03 10:02:22	AfterShave	Make russians out of it
2013-02-03 10:02:28	AfterShave	And then it becomes tasty
2013-02-03 10:02:30	Malachite	it was apparently a straight vertical climb through drunkenness levels when i got to that point
2013-02-03 10:03:19	AfterShave	I have a severe aversion to bad tastes. I need something tasty, at least at the start :P

2013-02-03 10:04:27	AfterShave	That's almost decent
2013-02-03 10:04:39	AfterShave	I mean, it's tasty for beer. But I do not like the general taste of beer
2013-02-03 10:04:43	AfterShave	Hälsinge Rököl
2013-02-03 10:04:46	RPharazon|NB	You are probably drinking the cheapo lite beers made by the hundreds of thousands of gallons that taste like piss and dirt
2013-02-03 10:05:03	Malachite	rpharazon didnt i already say i was in america

2013-02-03 10:05:31	AfterShave	I've tasted rather many kinds of beer. And the main thing keeping me from them all is that they taste like beer :P
2013-02-03 10:05:46	AfterShave	The rököl (smoke beer) however is still the best

2013-02-03 10:19:41	RPharazon|NB	More cutscene
2013-02-03 10:20:11	AfterShave	Because MC is somewhat inspired by DF I heard
2013-02-03 10:20:16	AfterShave	Obviously relevant
2013-02-03 10:21:39	AfterShave	Not that DF seems to be discussed often here anyway
2013-02-03 10:22:04	Malachite	its more a chan for people smart enough to play DF
2013-02-03 10:22:30	AfterShave	Speaking of which, does anyone know how to make rabbits give like, one meat?
2013-02-03 10:22:48	sandbox	sounds kinky

2013-02-03 10:26:42	AfterShave	I guess what my real question here is. How to I alter butchering returns in Dwarf Fortress
2013-02-03 10:27:35	Malachite	raw edits?

2013-02-03 10:31:31	Malachite	i thought it would be the raw for the rabbit
2013-02-03 10:31:58	AfterShave	So did I at first
2013-02-03 10:32:12	AfterShave	I'm looking at how pigs work to see the difference
2013-02-03 10:33:00	sandbox	you'd have to increase their size I think
2013-02-03 10:33:30	AfterShave	But, I want rabbits that are rabbit sized
2013-02-03 10:33:37	AfterShave	Not like, pig sized rabbits
2013-02-03 10:34:20	AfterShave	And geese who are about 1/13th the size of a pig still give about the same amount of meat
2013-02-03 10:34:24	AfterShave	So I'm not too sure if it's just size
2013-02-03 10:36:04	sandbox	and I'm not sure if they were bigger if they'd need to eat more
2013-02-03 10:36:26	AfterShave	I'm pretty sure that's just the [grazer] tag

2013-02-03 12:41:45	Soadreqm	Damnit. The cheapest shipping is like twenty bucks.

2013-02-03 12:42:24	Soadreqm	And the next option is forty bucks. :/
2013-02-03 12:42:42	RPharazon|NB	2% failure rate is lots

2013-02-03 16:11:49	Energiya	yeah you dont really want a "really low dose" with shrooms, need a just right dose...which takes a couple times ti find

2013-02-04 03:33:54	Spekkio	So I play PF with some guys at the university of sydney, where I am not a student, but the gamers guild there doesn't discriminate on that basis. Last week they announced on their page that the regular room would be closed after 6:30pm on the day that we usually play.
2013-02-04 03:34:44	Spekkio	Since the stated game time was 3pm, I dutifully turned up. The GM was late by hours, as  usual, and then when about 6pm rolled around I was informed that I would not be able to come with them to the student housing, which is where they would be playing.
2013-02-04 03:34:48	Justin	hoo boy
2013-02-04 03:35:39	Spekkio	Because, despite being able to come with them last time (which I remember as mostly a non-event but they remember as a major fuck-around) they apparently pre-notified security of how many students and non-students would be there.
2013-02-04 03:35:57	Spekkio	And apparently I was not taken into account for the allotment of non-students.
2013-02-04 03:36:47	Spekkio	So I'm voicing my annoyance that I basically spent 2 hours in transit or transit-related acitivity on that day and I'm getting BILE in return from the freaking GM

2013-02-04 03:43:44	Phazorx	Spekkio: major point was to make it possible to retrieve broken part w/o redownloading whoel thing
2013-02-04 03:43:54	Phazorx	and thanks to this mechanic now we have torrents
2013-02-04 03:44:03	Phazorx	which actually work exactly the same as ancient scene packers
2013-02-04 03:44:36	Phazorx	none of these archives are actualy do any cind of compression
2013-02-04 03:44:59	Phazorx	rar's are actualy usualy larger due to added error correction routnes even

2013-02-04 04:44:43	@Makrond	ohhh i've played the demo of antichamber
2013-02-04 04:44:50	@Makrond	it was pretty great
2013-02-04 04:46:46	@Makrond	there were some mind-bendingly fiendish puzzles in the demo alone though
2013-02-04 04:46:58	@Makrond	some of them i wasn't even sure if they were supposed to be possible with the equipment i had available
2013-02-04 04:51:41	Phazorx	has it been released yet?
2013-02-04 04:59:24	Spekkio	Yeah, I have the full version
2013-02-04 04:59:33	Spekkio	I feel like I'm nearly done
2013-02-04 04:59:53	Spekkio	though tracking down the last few blackboard entries may take longer for each one.

2013-02-04 05:01:41	Spekkio	like, where you see a kind of "2" path just randomly in a wall
2013-02-04 05:06:22	Phazorx	is there a notion of walkthough ot is it procedural?
2013-02-04 05:07:58	Spekkio	A walkthrough is surely possible, but it's rather open-ended so pinning the player down to a single path seems a little odd
2013-02-04 05:08:05	Spekkio	speedruns also exist
2013-02-04 05:08:19	Spekkio	Maybe I'll watch one after I feel that I've basically plateaued in progress
2013-02-04 05:09:10	Phazorx	hmm... i was under imression the game was trying to be original in ways of presenting player with set of challengies each being uniquely generated based on previous choices
2013-02-04 05:09:16	Phazorx	which sounds procedural to me
2013-02-04 05:09:37	Phazorx	perhaps that can be taken advantage of, by exploring same choice patter, hence speedrun
2013-02-04 05:11:34	Spekkio	The game isn't procedural AFAIK
2013-02-04 05:11:43	Spekkio	but certainly there are some puzzles presented
2013-02-04 05:11:53	Spekkio	and depending on how you approach them you will get to a different part of the complex
2013-02-04 05:12:03	Spekkio	e.g. if you fall down the fucking pit because you followed instructions. Like an idiot.
2013-02-04 05:12:14	Phazorx	like totally different or just not in same order?
2013-02-04 05:12:29	Spekkio	totally different. The layout of the whole place is static
2013-02-04 05:12:36	Spekkio	if you fall down the pit you'll go down a different corridor
2013-02-04 05:12:41	Phazorx	so it's just branchign a lot then
2013-02-04 05:12:52	Spekkio	to me it seems more... sprawling
2013-02-04 05:13:07	Phazorx	well i mean from graph-theory level
2013-02-04 05:13:11	Spekkio	since you have the map in the Antechamber
2013-02-04 05:13:14	Spekkio	oh. yeah.
2013-02-04 05:13:25	Spekkio	and you can use the map to go to any main place you've been to before
2013-02-04 05:14:20	Phazorx	hmm... and if you make differnt choices at that time does 'map' update with new nodes forgetting old route?
2013-02-04 05:14:40	Spekkio	I'd say it's a "pretty good" game and worth it if you can get it cheap, but I'm not sure if it's worth about $10. $5, definitely. $15, I think not. Note that I think, philosohically, that basically all games should be cheap
2013-02-04 05:15:44	Phazorx	a gauge i use often for games is it should eb priced between trip to museum/art gallery and decent book :)
2013-02-04 05:18:17	Spekkio	There are a lot of rave reviews saying how it gets into your head and breaks the laws of nature and all that. Frankly I don't think I saw anything like that - to me, there's a large collection of varied and challenging puzzles. Many of them are about block manipulation. Others are more around just performing the "right" action.
2013-02-04 05:19:01	Spekkio	Anyway I am not officially retreating from the world for the night

2013-02-04 11:12:51	heph	so mainly china and russia and speceX

2013-02-04 11:20:22	@Makrond	well
2013-02-04 11:20:26	heph	and the "regulations" arent that great.
2013-02-04 11:20:28	sandbox	so did everyone else
2013-02-04 11:20:30	@Makrond	i don't think you really shoot things down when they're in space
2013-02-04 11:20:32	@Makrond	you just kind of
2013-02-04 11:20:33	@Makrond	shoot them
2013-02-04 11:22:06	BW	well…did the bits deorbit?
2013-02-04 11:22:09	heph	Makrond: ;) figure of speech
2013-02-04 11:22:33	@Makrond	BW: iirc it was a kinetic kill weapon so... no, not really

2013-02-04 11:23:02	@Makrond	hell even if it was just a big rocket/missile/whatever it's unlikely the bits would deorbit
2013-02-04 11:23:23	NEO|Phyte	said this in a different channel that linked that news thing, saying it here now
2013-02-04 11:23:25	@Makrond	the only way to actually bring a satellite down would be to send up a giant claw attached to a rocket (or maybe some kind of shuttle???)
2013-02-04 11:23:27	NEO|Phyte	rods from allah
2013-02-04 11:23:40	BW	if you hit it just right at a slow enough speed....
2013-02-04 11:23:56	BW	(so that it didn't disintegrate)
2013-02-04 11:23:56	@Makrond	reliably bring a satellite down that is
2013-02-04 11:24:12	@Makrond	slight problem
2013-02-04 11:24:24	@Makrond	it's travelling at 6,000m/s
2013-02-04 11:24:47	BW	relative speed, of course
2013-02-04 11:25:09	BW	a grapple would be the best way to keep it attached
2013-02-04 11:25:11	@Makrond	you'd basically have to send up a missile that rendezvous with it in orbit then turns around and decelerates both
2013-02-04 11:25:19	BW	yeah
2013-02-04 11:25:22	@Makrond	at which point, just send up a fuckin rocket with a claw on it
2013-02-04 11:25:25	sandbox	send Jeb up
2013-02-04 11:25:30	@Makrond	so much easier

2013-02-04 11:26:37	sandbox	I read all about it last week ;p
2013-02-04 11:26:42	@Makrond	replace that functionality, they don't need to replace the entire space shuttle program :V
2013-02-04 11:28:48	@Makrond	the kinds of missions the space shuttle was designed to do but never actually did because they are silly and unnecessary in a post-cold-war world are incredible
2013-02-04 11:28:58	Kidiri	Jeb? :D
2013-02-04 11:29:13	@smeding	Makrond: what kind of things would that be
2013-02-04 11:29:19	@Makrond	hell the only reason it exists at all is because the military wanted something with a ridiculous cross-range capability
2013-02-04 11:29:27	@Makrond	so they could fly it back over russia if they wanted
2013-02-04 11:29:39	@Makrond	well, deorbit it over russia
2013-02-04 11:29:47	@Makrond	then glide it back to america
2013-02-04 11:31:18	@Makrond	(this is why edwards afb has a huge runway)
2013-02-04 11:32:25	@Makrond	well also because kennedy didn't have a runway big enough for a long time, and all the testing at dryden
2013-02-04 11:32:51	@Makrond	but it sure was convenient to be able to land the shuttle on the west coast after flying over russia
2013-02-04 11:38:29	sandbox	weird http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/STS-131_afterglow.jpg
2013-02-04 11:40:51	sandbox	also, they would fly the shuttle backwards so any debris would hit it in the rear

2013-02-05 03:02:49	Essence13	So there's this caravan at the edge of the map.  They had no access because I tried putting doors in my depot room.  I fixed that, but they're still standing around.  I  tried removing/unremoving depot to reset, but no go.  Built second depot, but no go.
2013-02-05 03:03:01	Essence13	any ideas how to get them to come in before spring is over?

2013-02-05 06:49:49	AfterShave	My memories have been shattered!
2013-02-05 06:50:08	namad7	anyways the point i was making was that US5 isn't a game really (although that wikipedia page says there is a ps1 version in english)
2013-02-05 06:50:09	AfterShave	Not that they weren't a bit broken in the first place
2013-02-05 06:50:19	namad7	basically only us2 and us3 exist as slang terms
2013-02-05 06:50:31	namad7	there's no reason to refer to any other final fantasy games with the term "us"
2013-02-05 06:50:41	namad7	because those are the only us ports that were intentionally "misnumbered"
2013-02-05 06:50:41	AfterShave	Well, I was misinformed
2013-02-05 06:50:43	AfterShave	So I did :P
2013-02-05 06:50:51	Justin	yeah
2013-02-05 06:51:00	Justin	There is an English version of FF5 for the GBA and the PSX
2013-02-05 06:51:25	Justin	which was FF1 for the US?
2013-02-05 06:51:31	sandbox	why do you have to make this sound so complicated
2013-02-05 06:51:32	namad7	basically people don't say us-number because they mean the us version of the game, but just to clarify because for the numbers 2 and 3 two totally different games exist with the same number
2013-02-05 06:51:57	namad7	with j2 and j3 being fairly unpopular somewhat awful nes games and us2 and us3 being the most popular early final fantasy games there were, which is why those were the ones they bothered to port
2013-02-05 06:52:40	Justin	anyway it's weird to release a game starting with "Final Fantasy 4" anyway without releasing the first one in English during the era in which the internet was still not widely used yet
2013-02-05 06:52:47	sandbox	the rotw didn't get 1,2,3
2013-02-05 06:52:59	Justin	sandbox: Rotw sounds familiar

2013-02-05 06:54:10	Justin	no

2013-02-05 06:54:44	Justin	oh
2013-02-05 06:54:50	sandbox	they decided to drop the number system for the first game to be released
2013-02-05 06:54:57	Justin	so they released J1 to the US
2013-02-05 06:55:17	Justin	but then Square decided to go and forgo 2 and 3
2013-02-05 06:55:25	Justin	and proceeded to port 4 to the US
2013-02-05 06:55:28	Justin	naming it "2" for the US
2013-02-05 06:56:13	Justin	Then skipped porting FF5 to the US
2013-02-05 06:56:21	Justin	then decided to port FF6 to the US
2013-02-05 06:56:29	Justin	Naming it "3"
2013-02-05 06:56:41	sandbox	the first 3 were NES games
2013-02-05 06:56:46	Justin	Then Square decided to stop with the bullshit and named "Final Fantasy 7" as "Final Fantasy 7"

2013-02-05 06:57:01	sandbox	indeed
2013-02-05 06:57:07	Justin	while clueless Americans were wondering "THEN WHERE IS 4,5,6???"
2013-02-05 06:57:22	Justin	so in a nutshell
2013-02-05 06:57:41	Justin	1 was ported to the US, 2&3 were not, 4 was ported to the US, 5 was not, 6 was ported to the US
2013-02-05 06:57:46	sandbox	and people are still having to explain this 20 years later
2013-02-05 06:57:55	Justin	and uh
2013-02-05 06:58:10	Justin	They decided to name their US releases incrementally until 3
2013-02-05 06:58:15	Justin	OKAY
2013-02-05 06:58:18	Justin	I UNDERSTAND NOW

2013-02-05 06:58:45	Justin	We're talking about the original releases
2013-02-05 06:58:58	Justin	Everyone rejoiced when they dropped the bullshit and named the remakes the actual number

2013-02-05 06:59:44	sandbox	and none of them were released here until 7
2013-02-05 07:00:10	Justin	well that was a mouthful
2013-02-05 07:00:24	Justin	Unfortunately I have a compulsion to restate everything in a nutshell over and over again
2013-02-05 07:00:27	Justin	just to make sure I get it right :(

2013-02-05 09:03:40	Raziel	It's not progress
2013-02-05 09:03:42	Raziel	Since they're shit
2013-02-05 09:03:50	Raziel	Yeah, what BW said
2013-02-05 09:03:53	Raziel	The improvement part is missing
2013-02-05 09:04:26	GauHelldragon	well just by the fact that these clones have actual graphics and gui makes them improvements
2013-02-05 09:05:17	GauHelldragon	but if you're going to begrudge them the fact that they don't have the complexity or features of dwarf fortress
2013-02-05 09:05:17	Raziel	So if I take a supercomputer and add a user-friendly UI to it but make it 100 times slower, it'll be an improvement?
2013-02-05 09:05:30	GauHelldragon	then you're never going to find a game that you think is an imporvement to df
2013-02-05 09:05:35	BW	yep. an improvement with tradeoffs
2013-02-05 09:06:13	GauHelldragon	gnomoria for example is going a whole other direction than df
2013-02-05 09:06:30	GauHelldragon	and they obviously have other shit that's improved beyond just graphics and GUI
2013-02-05 09:06:56	GauHelldragon	Raziel : depends on what you mean by improvement
2013-02-05 09:07:04	GauHelldragon	if it's a product that you are selling, then yes
2013-02-05 09:07:33	GauHelldragon	if you compare say, a home pc to a buisness server
2013-02-05 09:07:54	GauHelldragon	one is really powerful and fast and one is easy to use
2013-02-05 09:08:30	GauHelldragon	well, actually i don't know which market is more profitable/successful
2013-02-05 09:08:43	Raziel	But why can't we just have both >:
2013-02-05 09:09:11	GauHelldragon	the only way you're going to have a game with all the stuff DF has but also a gui is if toady adds it himself
2013-02-05 09:09:26	GauHelldragon	that's on the 'to-do list'
2013-02-05 09:09:27	BW	because things cost
2013-02-05 09:09:36	BW	money, time, materials, somehow, they cost
2013-02-05 09:09:43	GauHelldragon	yeah

2013-02-05 09:15:34	GarthAlgar	i hope it isn't very similar to terraria, the fluff around it seems nice, but i hate the gameplay of terraria :o
2013-02-05 09:17:02	Raziel	why
2013-02-05 09:18:01	GarthAlgar	because it's bad
2013-02-05 09:18:55	GarthAlgar	i heard the combat gets more fun with later weapons, but i never endured it long enough to get any
2013-02-05 09:19:14	GarthAlgar	and the digging around and building stuff is way too fiddly to be fun
2013-02-05 09:19:51	NEO|Phyte	yeah, terraria is pretty slow until you get to about gold-level gear
2013-02-05 09:20:05	NEO|Phyte	then it starts to pick up a bit, especially once you start taking down bosses

2013-02-05 13:23:04	nuthulu	Keep in mind, I haven't beat the entire wii u version yet, but i'd say nifflas games and eversion come to mind

2013-02-05 15:20:50	AfterShave	red
2013-02-05 15:21:02	@Makrond	you gotta do more puzzles basically
2013-02-05 15:21:09	AfterShave	Is going through blocks from behind a seam in the geometry used anywhere?
2013-02-05 15:21:12	AfterShave	Or is it just, a bug
2013-02-05 15:21:20	AfterShave	It changes the look of things
2013-02-05 15:21:21	@Makrond	i don't believe so
2013-02-05 15:21:57	@Makrond	but yeah have you climbed the tower yet
2013-02-05 15:22:00	AfterShave	apo! Get to the art gallery and the tunnel at the back. Place blocks on the outside to cover half, enter the tunnel and then go back out the blocks
2013-02-05 15:22:15	apo	... art gallery?
2013-02-05 15:22:16	AfterShave	Look at the disconnected chunk
2013-02-05 15:22:27	AfterShave	The place with 9 cubes with stuff in them
2013-02-05 15:22:27	AfterShave	Art gallery
2013-02-05 15:22:43	AfterShave	I've climbed A tower
2013-02-05 15:22:46	AfterShave	But not THE tower
2013-02-05 15:22:47	AfterShave	So to say
2013-02-05 15:23:10	@Makrond	everything leads to the art gallery eventually
2013-02-05 15:23:15	@Makrond	it's actually quite frustrating
2013-02-05 15:23:17	AfterShave	So I've seen
2013-02-05 15:23:27	AfterShave	Which is good in a way, because it means you'll have blocks when you get there
2013-02-05 15:23:31	@Makrond	because there's nowhere really to go from the art gallery
2013-02-05 15:23:44	AfterShave	There is, the place I asked apo to go :P
2013-02-05 15:23:52	@Makrond	well
2013-02-05 15:24:01	AfterShave	If you place blocks in this alternate art gallery. It looks odd through the windows
2013-02-05 15:24:03	@Makrond	after a certain point there isn't

2013-02-05 15:25:45	AfterShave	You just need some blocks

2013-02-05 15:29:47	@Makrond	but yeah fly??? is easy to get across with any gun because you can use the blocks that make up fly??? to build a bridge

2013-02-05 18:31:22	SL	They've saturated the market.

2013-02-05 18:32:16	SL	right
2013-02-05 18:32:27	RPharazon|NB	Yeah, Peak Zombie in 2008
2013-02-05 18:32:30	 *	SL nods
2013-02-05 18:32:34	RPharazon|NB	Everything after that was just capitalizing on the zombie fad
2013-02-05 18:32:40	RPharazon|NB	Now every other game is a zombie game
2013-02-05 18:32:43	RPharazon|NB	For better or for worse
2013-02-05 18:33:07	SL	Master of Magic let you raise zombie armies, and it was actually fun at the time
2013-02-05 18:33:13	SL	but that was the 90s
2013-02-05 18:33:17	SL	and we were nowhere near peak zombie
2013-02-05 18:35:28	RPharazon|NB	I miss space games with 6DOF
2013-02-05 18:35:31	RPharazon|NB	Or space RTS games
2013-02-05 18:35:42	RPharazon|NB	Freespace 2 and IWar 2 and Homeworld 2 were the last
2013-02-05 18:35:47	RPharazon|NB	Then the games just died
2013-02-05 18:36:11	RPharazon|NB	Hot damn
2013-02-05 18:36:16	RPharazon|NB	I love the ending to The Atomic Cafe
2013-02-05 18:36:20	RPharazon|NB	Best ending to any documentary ever
2013-02-05 18:36:24	SL	Star Ruler is pretty fun still
2013-02-05 18:36:29	SL	and that's a kind of space rts
2013-02-05 18:37:40	RPharazon|NB	A montage of a lot of duck and cover footage
2013-02-05 18:37:43	RPharazon|NB	And nuclear explosions

2013-02-05 18:38:26	SL	Ever seen Dr. Strangelove?
2013-02-05 18:39:18	RPharazon|NB	Yes
2013-02-05 18:39:20	RPharazon|NB	Many times
2013-02-05 18:39:36	RPharazon|NB	They went for a "this was a silly movie so have a silly montage"
2013-02-05 18:39:49	SL	ah, so you're familiar with the ending to that as well then :P
2013-02-05 18:40:01	RPharazon|NB	The Atomic Cafe went for "this is a silly movie because of the things people took seriously and at face value so this is an unintentionally silly montage"
2013-02-05 18:40:44	RPharazon|NB	Dr. Strangelove was a silly movie because it treated serious things in a very satirical and over-the-top manner
2013-02-05 18:41:10	RPharazon|NB	The Atomic Cafe was a silly movie because it simply presented things as they were which were inherently silly using hindsight and knowledge we now have
2013-02-05 18:41:48	FFLaguna	Dr. Strangelove was only silly in a _good_ sense
2013-02-05 18:42:08	RPharazon|NB	Like the entire Red Scare or the army tests with soldiers running into the areas where an atomic blast had just taken place or people thinking that hiding under a desk would do anything meaningful (apart from giving people a sense of purpose or safety in their last moments)
2013-02-05 18:42:48	RPharazon|NB	It has footage of a family in a Duck and Cover PSA using a picnic blanket as protection against an atomic blast
2013-02-05 18:43:49	SL	If you were far enough, firefighters have some blankets for providing protection from fire
2013-02-05 18:44:09	RPharazon|NB	From fire yes
2013-02-05 18:44:13	SL	yes
2013-02-05 18:44:20	RPharazon|NB	Not from the shock wave, radiation, or heat wave of an atomic blast
2013-02-05 18:44:22	SL	kinda useless against radiation, blast, overpressure, etc
2013-02-05 18:44:37	RPharazon|NB	And I don't think families carried around firefighter-grade blankets to picnics
2013-02-05 18:44:44	SL	but if it JUST HAPPENS to cause a forest fire...
2013-02-05 18:44:46	RPharazon|NB	Especially with those lovely patterns

2013-02-05 23:55:56	Spekkio	I got laid off today due to the company not catching enough new projects

2013-02-05 23:57:23	Spekkio	I admit I felt a little suspicious when my boss asked me to basically get everything on my big project all finished off, followed by specifically not including me in a planned site visit to a client on the following day

2013-02-07 03:12:34	namad7	they just do bad stuff, they'll write articles about things without knowing anything about them at all, and their only real goal is to get views not provide actual news
2013-02-07 03:12:52	namad7	i've always hated how they'll just pay one guy to write a review of one version of a game and then copy paste it for all the other versions of the game
2013-02-07 03:13:12	namad7	why not just link to the article so if you want the ps3 review and you are linked to the pc review you'll at least realize it wasn't written on the ps3 version
2013-02-07 03:13:22	namad7	or you know why not devote 1paragraph or 1sentence to differences in versions?
2013-02-07 03:13:32	namad7	copy/pasting content is just a waste of bandwidth and server storage

2013-02-08 06:32:05	Dhrakon	hey question...
2013-02-08 06:33:44	Dhrakon	if i need flux for steel, and there's none on the map i'll have to import it, does it matter the wiegth of the stone that i ask to import. Meaning, if i ask for a lighter stone the caravan will bring in more?
2013-02-08 06:34:05	Dhrakon	or should i just not worry about producing it and only importing steel bars

2013-02-08 06:38:49	Dhrakon	i've checked the numbers with dfhack i didnt see any flux
2013-02-08 06:39:48	@Makrond	if it's valid flux stone then it doesn't matter how much it weighs
2013-02-08 06:40:18	@Makrond	in theory they might bring more if it's lighter but they also might use a bunch of anvils to fill up the extra weight too

2013-02-08 07:11:55	veryinky	Dhrakon: If you want flux stone, ask for every flux stone at maximum to maximize the chances they'll bring some
2013-02-08 07:12:49	Dhrakon	I see, I guess I'll need to up production to be able to pay for it all, I've been making a crap top of stone crafts, is there a better way to make money you think?
2013-02-08 07:13:10	veryinky	Prepared meals have excellent export value
2013-02-08 07:14:18	veryinky	Personally, I like selling exceptional/masterwork iron weapons and shields that I use to train up my weapon and armor smiths.

2013-02-08 07:15:59	veryinky	Heh
2013-02-08 07:16:04	Dhrakon	i used herbalism a lot, dunno if that's available for you

2013-02-08 07:46:24	nuthulu	I find quite a few German minecraft playthroughs when randomly browsing
2013-02-08 07:46:51	nuthulu	Although a lot of English/British ones are probably people who say syndicate/yogscast and are trying to be them
2013-02-08 07:47:30	Manicmonkey	just thought it would be amusing if it had a very similar demographic to DF, where there are a disproportionate amount of Australians/New zealander/Finns
2013-02-08 07:48:14	Manicmonkey	messing around with tekkit
2013-02-08 07:48:19	nuthulu	Well that's because Australia is a scorching terrifying wasteland

2013-02-08 07:49:30	Manicmonkey	like the sims but hardcore
2013-02-08 07:49:47	nuthulu	Yeah, to Australians/Finnish, the sims is a fantasy game
2013-02-08 07:49:55	Manicmonkey	but for the real finnish experience you would need to be able to craft booze
2013-02-08 07:50:03	Manicmonkey	well..same for .AU really
2013-02-08 07:50:09	Manicmonkey	ALL PEOPLE DO HERE IS DRINK

2013-02-08 07:50:18	Manicmonkey	as a non drinkjer, it makes things boring
2013-02-08 07:51:00	RPharazon	We need sewage and waste management in DF
2013-02-08 07:51:13	RPharazon	Just so people can make elaborate sewage systems that are overengineered

2013-02-08 07:51:45	RPharazon	Yes
2013-02-08 07:51:49	RPharazon	It'd add nothing meaningful to the game
2013-02-08 07:51:57	RPharazon	But at least the megaprojects would be interesting
2013-02-08 07:52:03	Manicmonkey	of course, with those two elements in play its only a matter of time to dorfs with scat fetiches show up

2013-02-08 14:30:24	AfterShave	Works for me
2013-02-08 14:30:54	@smeding	a password has less information content if you know its length up front
2013-02-08 14:31:04	sandbox	sorry, I was too busy guesstabating
2013-02-08 14:31:13	AfterShave	And if you know the first character
2013-02-08 14:31:20	AfterShave	The first character is really important it seems
2013-02-08 14:31:27	@smeding	wat
2013-02-08 14:32:22	Kidiri	AfterShave, so is the second.

2013-02-08 14:34:28	@Makrond	well for the purposes of dictionary attacks knowing the first letter dramatically reduces the number of words it could be
2013-02-08 14:34:41	AfterShave	I'm almost correct
2013-02-08 14:34:42	AfterShave	For once
2013-02-08 14:34:43	AfterShave	yay
2013-02-08 14:34:48	@Makrond	moreso than knowing that the sixth letter is 'i' or something
2013-02-08 14:36:04	Dhrakon	doesn't matter if you use more than one dictionary word
2013-02-08 14:36:10	G-Flex	how are you going to know the first letter
2013-02-08 14:36:15	Dhrakon	because then you need to  know the first letter, and the first position
2013-02-08 14:36:19	Dhrakon	of every word
2013-02-08 14:36:32	G-Flex	it's a password, you can't just figure out individual characters separately
2013-02-08 14:36:35	Dhrakon	but if you have a keylogger, all these assumptions fly out the window
2013-02-08 14:36:49	Kidiri	Of course you can, G-Flex.
2013-02-08 14:36:53	AfterShave	Keylogger is the boss

2013-02-08 14:38:49	@Makrond	if you have a keylogger or a stolen hash or anything like that then yeah obviously the security of the password doesn't matter at all

2013-02-08 14:39:39	Dhrakon	so we can assume that length & complexity (more so length i'd think) compbat brute force better
2013-02-08 14:39:53	Caveswallowman	I just put a Garbagedump on a (retractable) bridge, and set a stone to be dumped

2013-02-09 01:15:00	Captain	I haven't read the Buffy comics ye
2013-02-09 01:15:01	Captain	yet

2013-02-09 01:15:16	b_boy_212	ok anyhow buffy sleeps with a slayer
2013-02-09 01:15:32	Captain	that seems oddly out of character
2013-02-09 01:15:35	b_boy_212	for no real reason other than hey guys look how far out we are
2013-02-09 01:15:52	Captain	she's never been gay before.
2013-02-09 01:16:02	Captain	or showed any signs of being that way inclined.
2013-02-09 01:16:09	b_boy_212	theres a whole thing with "the slayers pure love" bringing her back from some sort of sleep spell
2013-02-09 01:16:16	b_boy_212	exactly
2013-02-09 01:16:52	b_boy_212	im not here to judge homosexuals (we all know how much fun that is on the internet) but it makes no sense
2013-02-09 01:17:21	b_boy_212	also alot of other things were pretty dumb in my opinion but the angel/spike comics are pretty great
2013-02-09 01:17:32	Captain	I've read those
2013-02-09 01:17:35	Captain	they are great.
2013-02-09 01:17:57	b_boy_212	nice to see some character development for illyria
2013-02-09 01:18:07	Captain	Wesley being a ghost is pretty cool, too

2013-02-09 06:07:39	Bones	stupid question, could I use minecarts are a ambulance system to my medical wards?
2013-02-09 06:13:34	AfterShave	I'd say probably not
2013-02-09 06:13:48	AfterShave	Do you mean for recovering wounded people?
2013-02-09 06:14:18	Bones	aye
2013-02-09 06:14:52	AfterShave	Then no, they would have the "recover wounded" job and walk to the wounded and carry him back
2013-02-09 06:15:15	AfterShave	Rather than push minecarts job
2013-02-09 06:15:17	Bones	like "urist! your missing a leg, instead of carrying you all the way up several levels I'll put you in this handy minecart and push you up this convient minecart track directly the the medical ward
2013-02-09 06:15:39	Raziel	you're*
2013-02-09 06:15:40	Raziel	hehehhehe
2013-02-09 06:16:04	AfterShave	Hmm, do creatures falling into a minecart's tile go inside it?
2013-02-09 06:16:40	AfterShave	Because if that's the case, you could probably make some complex system that drops the wounded and rescuer into a minecart that shoots off into the hospital

2013-02-09 08:11:48	FFLaguna	Prolly not your fault
2013-02-09 08:11:51	GauHelldragon	i think the reactor crashed it!!!
2013-02-09 08:11:53	FFLaguna	Although you may be the first nuke reactor
2013-02-09 08:12:00	FFLaguna	I've never heard of anyone operating a nuke reactor yet
2013-02-09 08:12:04	FFLaguna	Well
2013-02-09 08:12:08	FFLaguna	I'm pinging the server now
2013-02-09 08:12:19	GauHelldragon	i placed the block next to a mfsu

2013-02-09 15:18:08	nuthulu	Then again my computer is rather weird (it runs Dawn of war 2 fine, yet has trouble with empire total war :\)
2013-02-09 15:18:23	TWA	but Ive had it get up to 20Mbs before
2013-02-09 15:18:50	b_boy_212	your not trying to get rid of me are you?

2013-02-09 15:18:58	TWA	haha
2013-02-09 15:19:41	b_boy_212	hows icewind dale
2013-02-09 15:20:08	Zackariah	Is path of exile multiplayer?
2013-02-09 15:20:28	b_boy_212	mmo i believe
2013-02-09 15:21:01	nuthulu	Well you can play it singleplayer
2013-02-09 15:21:10	b_boy_212	is it any good?
2013-02-09 15:21:25	b_boy_212	it was my understanding it was purely mmo but if theres good singleplayer
2013-02-09 15:21:29	nuthulu	It's pretty good, similar to diablo 2
2013-02-09 15:21:40	nuthulu	The game does have a bit of a difficulty ramp though
2013-02-09 15:21:47	b_boy_212	exile or icewind dale?
2013-02-09 15:21:53	Zackariah	How is it compared to torchlight 2 or diablo 3?
2013-02-09 15:21:55	nuthulu	And certain builds/classes are really overpowered or underpowered
2013-02-09 15:22:44	nuthulu	Zackariah i'd say it's more hardcore than torchlight 2 and I haven't played diablo 3
2013-02-09 15:23:00	b_boy_212	so icewind this is?
2013-02-09 15:24:28	nuthulu	I've never played icewind dale, although you could probably play like half the game in the time it takes PoE to download xD
2013-02-09 15:24:59	b_boy_212	how do you make xchat start on startup?
2013-02-09 15:25:03	b_boy_212	im looking but

2013-02-09 17:36:11	TWA	So after losing a good deal of my military against a poisonous pink scale with wings (that was drooling), the other militiaa members are sad. Recommendations?
2013-02-09 17:38:00	RaidSoft	immediate mass executions
2013-02-09 17:38:42	TWA	of those who are sad?
2013-02-09 17:38:53	GauHelldragon	:x ???
2013-02-09 17:39:01	RaidSoft	of random people, so they know not to mess with you
2013-02-09 17:39:18	RaidSoft	also this may or may not be good advice
2013-02-09 17:39:31	TWA	lol
2013-02-09 17:39:34	TWA	it definitely isnt
2013-02-09 17:39:48	AfterShave	If only you were able to sentence people manually
2013-02-09 17:40:09	TWA	for being sad?
2013-02-09 17:40:13	RaidSoft	meh, burrow them to an atom smasher, problem solved
2013-02-09 17:40:27	TWA	why is killing them the answer!?
2013-02-09 17:40:31	AfterShave	Exactly
2013-02-09 17:40:39	AfterShave	Why couldn't it be fifteen years in the dungeon
2013-02-09 17:40:43	RaidSoft	Killing someone or something is always the answer
2013-02-09 17:41:25	AfterShave	That will NOT I repeat NOT be a gilded palace to keep them from becoming more miserable
2013-02-09 17:42:07	AfterShave	Don't gild your dungeons folk, a tether and a door is exactly what criminals need
2013-02-09 17:42:15	TWA	If I put more gold statues in the barracks will that help?
2013-02-09 17:42:28	AfterShave	Probably
2013-02-09 17:42:33	TWA	k
2013-02-09 17:43:45	TWA	Well, only the champion is till sad apparently
2013-02-09 17:43:51	TWA	so they got over that quickly….
2013-02-09 17:44:10	TWA	though he is the one that killed said snail, so i figured he should've been all set from the start
2013-02-09 17:47:03	TWA	Im just making floors out of gold at this point
2013-02-09 17:47:20	TWA	I have about 1Mil in crafts stored up and 524 bars just sitting in a stockpile...
2013-02-09 17:47:40	AfterShave	I hope you're making paved roads and not per tile
2013-02-09 17:48:00	TWA	!
2013-02-09 17:48:01	TWA	explain
2013-02-09 17:48:18	AfterShave	Paved roads require very little material, and still makes a floor of said material
2013-02-09 17:48:32	AfterShave	You'll save around two thirds of gold
2013-02-09 17:48:36	TWA	does it give the same value towards happy thoughts or whatever?
2013-02-09 17:48:47	AfterShave	Well, it's a golden road
2013-02-09 17:48:50	AfterShave	Probably
2013-02-09 17:49:04	RaidSoft	engraved walls/floors are much more valuable I believe
2013-02-09 17:49:26	TWA	right, but you can't engrave constructions
2013-02-09 17:49:45	AfterShave	That's what he means
2013-02-09 17:49:46	RaidSoft	which is why you try and have your important areas in rock and then engrave that
2013-02-09 17:49:50	AfterShave	Engrave instead of make golden walls
2013-02-09 17:50:18	TWA	Right, but my barracks are on the top level, no rock. So they are constucted
2013-02-09 17:50:29	TWA	top level so my militia can get at whatever it needs to quickly
2013-02-09 17:50:46	AfterShave	Quickly to like, the dungeons where beasts enter?
2013-02-09 17:51:17	TWA	My path down to the adamantine mins is outside my fort for…safety reasons
2013-02-09 17:51:39	AfterShave	Eeeeww, you have to go in the sun first?
2013-02-09 17:51:44	TWA	so as things gnome up the stairs, like troglodytes, they need to go take care of that, or poison flying pink snails/etc
2013-02-09 17:51:46	AfterShave	How undwarven of you!
2013-02-09 17:52:02	TWA	haha, one of my other forts, is all silver and above ground

2013-02-09 18:09:03	Malicus	Yeah, mud is not a very strong material. Though snow is the standard "what a joke of a FB" material.
2013-02-09 18:10:00	AfterShave	I assume it melts?

2013-02-09 18:24:32	GauHelldragon	1 ran like crap
2013-02-09 18:24:37	GauHelldragon	1 ran like super crap
2013-02-09 18:24:52	AfterShave	Might it be your, computer?
2013-02-09 18:24:53	GauHelldragon	and 1 required a mimum screen resolution of 6000x4000
2013-02-09 18:25:01	G-Flex	which games
2013-02-09 18:25:05	AfterShave	Sounds like Aurora the last one
2013-02-09 18:25:06	GauHelldragon	no it ran at lik 2 FPS on the title screen
2013-02-09 18:25:09	TWA	This map is so rich! and sans-goblin and VERY volcano!
2013-02-09 18:25:16	GauHelldragon	it wasn't even fucking rendering anything
2013-02-09 18:25:30	AfterShave	Actually it just need like at least 1200x1080 or something
2013-02-09 18:25:44	RPharazon|NB	It's designed for his monitor
2013-02-09 18:25:50	AfterShave	Which my LAST screen couldn't handle

2013-02-09 18:26:03	AfterShave	So I'll have to return that
2013-02-09 18:26:06	GauHelldragon	yeah i mean that'sf ine but at least add some fucking scroll bars
2013-02-09 18:26:06	GauHelldragon	or something
2013-02-09 18:26:15	GauHelldragon	is it really that hard

2013-02-09 18:26:23	AfterShave	I mean, it has three splotches that kinda shine through black colors
2013-02-09 18:26:23	GauHelldragon	or maybe it is. i don't know GUIs
2013-02-09 18:26:24	RPharazon|NB	Adding a scroll bar using that programming language and framework
2013-02-09 18:26:26	RPharazon|NB	To the entire thing
2013-02-09 18:26:29	RPharazon|NB	Yeah, it's hard

2013-02-09 22:27:15	fcrick	he seems to be making them slowly
2013-02-09 22:27:22	fcrick	but i get a lot of spam :
2013-02-09 22:27:27	Hollywars	um you want them to be in large stacks
2013-02-09 22:27:30	Hollywars	because he can only brew a stack at once
2013-02-09 22:28:34	fcrick	would it speed up if i had another still or something?
2013-02-09 22:28:46	Zackariah	It happens when one person picks up the entire barrel of plump helmets and then another person tries to pick up another and brew it and cant find the barrel
2013-02-09 22:29:12	fcrick	i see so if i had a ton of them it wouldn't be an issue

2013-02-10 04:34:35	veryinky	It is. We're talking about HP ink cartridges, the have chips on them to enforce lock in. HP uses copyright laws to prevent tampering or circumvention of it's "drm".
2013-02-10 04:35:47	sandbox	unrelated to inks but it annoys me that all printers are black now
2013-02-10 04:35:52	veryinky	When you buy an HP printer and HP ink cartridge, you're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use the ink. The chip on the cartridge will shut off the flow at a predetermined time forcing you to buy new ink cartridges.

2013-02-10 04:48:10	G-Flex	Spekkio: why
2013-02-10 04:49:12	Spekkio	because it's using the volume of liquid in each bar to represent the value of each one

2013-02-10 04:49:47	sandbox	firmware hacks too
2013-02-10 04:49:50	Spekkio	when really it would be more meaningful to show the amount of liquid you get for a constant amount of cash
2013-02-10 04:49:56	Spekkio	or just a normal bar graph

2013-02-10 04:52:59	Spekkio	it's like trying to communicate the relative value of rocks, gold, and diamonds

2013-02-10 04:53:19	Spekkio	and you do this with one little pebble, a small pile of gold, and a bigger pile of diamonds

2013-02-10 06:10:24	GauHelldragon	easy
2013-02-10 06:10:30	GauHelldragon	you do it "the walden way"

2013-02-10 06:10:55	FFLaguna	I have no idea how they do it.
2013-02-10 06:11:04	GauHelldragon	they use splenda instead of sugar
2013-02-10 06:11:11	FFLaguna	I think a lot of their stuff uses some sort of "base", I forget
2013-02-10 06:11:14	G-Flex	lmao it's because it's all fake
2013-02-10 06:11:18	FFLaguna	Like the same thing for a line of their products
2013-02-10 06:11:19	G-Flex	look at their strawberry fruit spread
2013-02-10 06:11:22	G-Flex	no actual strawberry to be found

2013-02-10 06:11:50	FFLaguna	Of course, strawberries have calories :P
2013-02-10 06:11:54	G-Flex	yeah it's basically all fake
2013-02-10 06:12:02	GauHelldragon	they make fuckin the best apple juice

2013-02-10 06:12:19	FFLaguna	What is wrong with fake food?
2013-02-10 06:12:22	G-Flex	the way to eat healthy is to actually change your habits and learn to like healthy food

2013-02-10 06:12:34	FFLaguna	What is "healthy food"
2013-02-10 06:12:35	G-Flex	not to trick your mind and body into thinking you're eating something when you're basically ingesting rubber cement

2013-02-10 06:12:54	GauHelldragon	"healthy food" is fresh fruit and vegetables
2013-02-10 06:13:00	GauHelldragon	more or less
2013-02-10 06:13:07	G-Flex	healthy food is not "stuff that seems like X but is actually not X"
2013-02-10 06:13:16	FFLaguna	To lose fat you need to eat less calories than your body burns in a day
2013-02-10 06:13:21	G-Flex	artificial sweeteners are not a great idea except in contrast to eating poorly in the first place
2013-02-10 06:13:26	G-Flex	FFLaguna: then eat less fattening foods
2013-02-10 06:13:29	FFLaguna	If you can eat food that tastes like high-calorie food but with way less calories, that's a GREAT way to meet that goal
2013-02-10 06:13:29	G-Flex	eat /less/ mayo, not /fake/ mayo
2013-02-10 06:13:29	FFLaguna	Yes
2013-02-10 06:13:36	GauHelldragon	honestly friuits and vegetables is like 90% of healthy diet
2013-02-10 06:13:43	FFLaguna	Or you can still enjoy GOOD TASTING FOOD with fake mayo
2013-02-10 06:13:49	FFLaguna	Instead of just going cold turkey and losing that flavor
2013-02-10 06:13:52	GauHelldragon	if you do that much, you're off to a good start
2013-02-10 06:13:52	G-Flex	"good tasting food" is not like
2013-02-10 06:13:54	G-Flex	a cosmological constant

2013-02-10 06:14:06	FFLaguna	I don't know what you're not getting
2013-02-10 06:14:06	G-Flex	you can actually learn to enjoy things based on what your body actually requires, as opposed to reinforcing bad habits via fake food
2013-02-10 06:14:14	GauHelldragon	anyway
2013-02-10 06:14:17	FFLaguna	It's miserable to just diet by simply EATING LESS
2013-02-10 06:14:18	FFLaguna	Really miserable
2013-02-10 06:14:23	G-Flex	then eat differently

2013-02-10 06:14:29	FFLaguna	You have to find a lot of tricks and stuff to successfully diet
2013-02-10 06:14:34	FFLaguna	That is eating differently
2013-02-10 06:14:35	G-Flex	then don't "diet"
2013-02-10 06:14:39	GauHelldragon	you can have a healthy diet with all the real versions of those foods
2013-02-10 06:14:44	G-Flex	eat differently in a way that does not involve eating pretend food
2013-02-10 06:15:00	FFLaguna	G-Flex, there's nothing wrong with fake food other than the word "fake" in it that you seem to have an issue with
2013-02-10 06:15:01	G-Flex	I'm also not entirely convinced that eating food pretending to be something it isn't doesn't fuck with your body's response to it, and metabolism, and your conditioned responses to said foods
2013-02-10 06:15:07	G-Flex	if you eat something sweet your body kind of expects sugar
2013-02-10 06:15:08	FFLaguna	What's wrong with making an ENJOYABLE low-calorie substitute?
2013-02-10 06:15:13	FFLaguna	What's wrong with making an ENJOYABLE low-calorie substitute? It's wrong because it's fake?
2013-02-10 06:15:13	GauHelldragon	you don't have to stop eating chocolate syrup to be healthy. just eat it for desert along with a balanced diet and it's 100% fine
2013-02-10 06:15:15	G-Flex	FFLaguna: I've been explaining what is
2013-02-10 06:15:17	G-Flex	no
2013-02-10 06:15:33	G-Flex	it's wrong because you could be choosing an actually-healthy alternative instead of a non-nutritive alternative that still pretends it's the real deal
2013-02-10 06:15:45	G-Flex	eating fake shit reinforces bad habits and discourages forming better ones
2013-02-10 06:15:52	FFLaguna	That
2013-02-10 06:15:55	FFLaguna	Is so wrong
2013-02-10 06:15:58	G-Flex	drinking a shit ton of diet coke just reinforces the bad habit of drinking a shit ton of coke
2013-02-10 06:15:59	FFLaguna	Your'e literally fixing a bad habit
2013-02-10 06:16:01	FFLaguna	Eating high calorie foods
2013-02-10 06:16:03	FFLaguna	Like mayonnaise
2013-02-10 06:16:04	FFLaguna	You're fixing that
2013-02-10 06:16:07	FFLaguna	It's a GOOD thing
2013-02-10 06:16:14	G-Flex	not really, because you still have the habit of eating a lot of mayo
2013-02-10 06:16:18	FFLaguna	Yet you don't have to go without tasting mayonnaise
2013-02-10 06:16:18	G-Flex	except you're just ingesting mayo substitute instead
2013-02-10 06:16:23	FFLaguna	Yes

2013-02-10 06:16:30	G-Flex	not really
2013-02-10 06:16:33	G-Flex	for the reasons I've already specified
2013-02-10 06:16:34	FFLaguna	Eating fake mayonnaise doesn't hurt your body
2013-02-10 06:16:45	FFLaguna	Eating real mayonnaise is calories
2013-02-10 06:16:47	G-Flex	you don't actually break your habit of eating mayo; you still /want/ it
2013-02-10 06:16:55	G-Flex	it's far better to encourage better eating habits
2013-02-10 06:16:56	G-Flex	like
2013-02-10 06:16:57	FFLaguna	And you can HAVE IT
2013-02-10 06:17:04	FFLaguna	That doesn't change that you want it :|
2013-02-10 06:17:10	G-Flex	except in doing that, you don't have something better, and don't train yourself to /enjoy/ things that are better
2013-02-10 06:17:12	FFLaguna	You can't suddenly not want ice cream or pizza
2013-02-10 06:17:18	FFLaguna	Dieting is hard as shit for a lot of people
2013-02-10 06:17:33	G-Flex	sure you can't, not suddenly, but you can change your tastes and habits if you actually care about the results and what food actually is and not just what it tastes like
2013-02-10 06:17:35	FFLaguna	It's reallly not the easy, unfortunately
2013-02-10 06:17:37	GauHelldragon	also
2013-02-10 06:17:41	G-Flex	of course it's not that easy
2013-02-10 06:17:49	GauHelldragon	unrelated who put all this lava and sheep in my base
2013-02-10 06:17:51	G-Flex	if someone needs to do this shit to get healthier, then fine, it's just not the optimal solution at all
2013-02-10 06:17:52	FFLaguna	G-Flex, I think you're pretty nuts about this issue, in a weird way
2013-02-10 06:17:53	GauHelldragon	:|
2013-02-10 06:18:13	FFLaguna	Well I can go with that then
2013-02-10 06:18:16	G-Flex	eating artificial mayo filled with artificial sweeteners and preservatives instead of something that could actually have a positive health benefit
2013-02-10 06:18:20	G-Flex	is very very fucking far from optimal
2013-02-10 06:18:31	FFLaguna	[23:18:18] <G-Flex> eating artificial mayo filled with artificial sweeteners and preservatives instead of something that could actually have a positive health benefit
2013-02-10 06:18:38	FFLaguna	I think this sentence is filled with a lot of popsci bunk :|
2013-02-10 06:18:40	G-Flex	I feel that part of the reason dieting is so hard is because shit like this prevents people from actually changing their habits!
2013-02-10 06:18:48	G-Flex	what popsci bunk
2013-02-10 06:19:00	FFLaguna	There's nothign wrong with artificial sweeteners and preservatives, and "positive health benefit" is all relative to everything
2013-02-10 06:19:17	FFLaguna	G-Flex - Dieting is hard becaus eyou have to eat less
2013-02-10 06:19:20	G-Flex	you're saying there's absolutely zero potential negative health effects from artificial sweeteners and preservatives
2013-02-10 06:19:28	G-Flex	eat less in terms of calories, sure, sorta
2013-02-10 06:19:29	FFLaguna	It's really hard to change the amount you eat
2013-02-10 06:19:35	G-Flex	of course it is
2013-02-10 06:19:43	FFLaguna	It's hard to substitute in healthier foods and stuff
2013-02-10 06:19:47	FFLaguna	Because you really want to eat the good tasting stuff
2013-02-10 06:19:49	G-Flex	but you don't get there by eating a weird simulacrum of the stuff you /already/ eat
2013-02-10 06:20:01	FFLaguna	Yes you do
2013-02-10 06:20:02	FFLaguna	It's less calories
2013-02-10 06:20:02	G-Flex	then learn to fucking re-educate your taste buds
2013-02-10 06:20:04	FFLaguna	And burns fat
2013-02-10 06:20:07	FFLaguna	You're still eating other food
2013-02-10 06:20:13	FFLaguna	You're not eating 100% pure zero-calorie food all day
2013-02-10 06:20:26	FFLaguna	You're still eating 1500-2000 calories a day of real food
2013-02-10 06:20:49	G-Flex	replacing X amount of food per day with a similar amount of fake food is not going to encourage better eating habits, it's just a crutch
2013-02-10 06:20:52	G-Flex	sometimes people need crutches
2013-02-10 06:20:54	G-Flex	but they are still crutches
2013-02-10 06:21:02	FFLaguna	What is a "good eating habit" and a "bad eating habit" ??
2013-02-10 06:21:19	G-Flex	a much better approach is to actually examine your dietary habits and try to adapt to a diet that suits your needs better, whatever those needs are
2013-02-10 06:21:23	FFLaguna	Good eating habits are eating a proper spread of fat, carbohydrates, and protein while keeping your overall caloric intake where you want it
2013-02-10 06:21:25	G-Flex	if you need more fiber, learn to like shit with fiber in it
2013-02-10 06:21:33	FFLaguna	Eating a variety of foods to get the required micronutrients as well
2013-02-10 06:21:48	G-Flex	eating fake mayo does not exactly help you get a significant "variety of foods"
2013-02-10 06:21:58	FFLaguna	Nope
2013-02-10 06:22:01	FFLaguna	It just adds taste
2013-02-10 06:22:04	G-Flex	these are just replacements for the apparently unhealthy crap you're already eating
2013-02-10 06:22:09	FFLaguna	You eat other food to meet those requirements
2013-02-10 06:22:13	FFLaguna	WHIC IS A GOOD THING
2013-02-10 06:22:21	FFLaguna	A healthy replacement for an unhealthy thing is GOOD
2013-02-10 06:22:26	G-Flex	"take X amount of the food you eat and make it non-nutritive" is not in any way the best way to form a better diet for yourself
2013-02-10 06:22:34	G-Flex	this isn't a "healthy replacement"
2013-02-10 06:22:45	G-Flex	it's a totally neutral replacement at absolute best
2013-02-10 06:22:54	G-Flex	and still doesn't allow you to break your bad habits
2013-02-10 06:22:56	FFLaguna	And a relative PLUS
2013-02-10 06:23:09	FFLaguna	Your bad habit isn't "eating mayonnaise or somethign that tastes like mayonnaise"
2013-02-10 06:23:14	G-Flex	if you crave fatty foods too much, that is a bad habit, and eating a bunch of food that tastes fatty but isn't will still have you craving fatty foods too much and can easily fuck you over in the future
2013-02-10 06:23:20	FFLaguna	It's eating way too many calories so your body keeps piling on fat until it hits an equilibrium
2013-02-10 06:23:25	G-Flex	and will prevent you from learning to like other, better foods
2013-02-10 06:23:25	FFLaguna	That's what your bad habit is
2013-02-10 06:23:47	FFLaguna	You can fix your bad habit by cutting out calories from your day, SUCH AS by substituting pickles for mayonnaise, or fake mayonnaise for mayonnaise
2013-02-10 06:24:00	G-Flex	I've already explained the flaw in that
2013-02-10 06:24:11	FFLaguna	There's no flaw
2013-02-10 06:24:17	FFLaguna	You want your proper spread of fat, carbs, and protein
2013-02-10 06:24:21	G-Flex	you admitted it's not optimal, yet there's no flaw???
2013-02-10 06:24:30	G-Flex	man diet is a lot more complicated than "the proper spread of fat, carbs, and protein"
2013-02-10 06:24:35	G-Flex	and a person's tastes and overall habits have a lot to do with it
2013-02-10 06:24:39	FFLaguna	With a caloric intake limit, and within that limit you want to eat a variety of foods to get the most micronutrients possible
2013-02-10 06:24:49	G-Flex	a much better approach is to train yourself to eat actual, nutritive food that is more healthy for you according to your needs
2013-02-10 06:25:01	G-Flex	you don't do that by eating a bunch of fake mayonaisse and diet coke
2013-02-10 06:25:12	G-Flex	you do it by, say, finding other condiments
2013-02-10 06:25:13	G-Flex	or other drinks
2013-02-10 06:25:13	FFLaguna	That isn't a truth at all
2013-02-10 06:25:15	G-Flex	or other foods
2013-02-10 06:25:21	FFLaguna	That's really silly
2013-02-10 06:25:21	G-Flex	that suit your needs better
2013-02-10 06:25:44	G-Flex	"drink healthier drinks instead of sugary soda" is a better solution than "drink non-nutritive soda instead of sugary soda"
2013-02-10 06:25:48	FFLaguna	If a person is eating way too many calories, and has way more fat, carbs, protein than he needs a day, it's ONLY GOOD to substitute some of the foods he's eating for other alternatives
2013-02-10 06:26:03	FFLaguna	And drink non-nutritive soda is a BETTER solution than drink sugary soda
2013-02-10 06:26:09	G-Flex	of course it is
2013-02-10 06:26:18	FFLaguna	I already said I could agree with that above
2013-02-10 06:26:19	G-Flex	because the latter isn't a solution at all??
2013-02-10 06:26:28	FFLaguna	It is a solution you nincompoop
2013-02-10 06:26:32	FFLaguna	What's the problem?
2013-02-10 06:26:32	G-Flex	...
2013-02-10 06:26:41	FFLaguna	What's the problem we're trying to solve?
2013-02-10 06:26:41	G-Flex	"drink sugary soda" is not a solution to "drinking sugary soda", no
2013-02-10 06:26:50	FFLaguna	What?
2013-02-10 06:26:51	FFLaguna	I didn't say that
2013-02-10 06:26:58	G-Flex	<FFLaguna> And drink non-nutritive soda is a BETTER solution than drink sugary soda
2013-02-10 06:27:02	G-Flex	anyway
2013-02-10 06:27:08	FFLaguna	non-nutritive soda is non-sugary soda
2013-02-10 06:27:14	FFLaguna	aka diet soda aka zero caloria soda
2013-02-10 06:27:24	G-Flex	I already agreed that if people need to do this stuff to get healthier, then that's great, but that there are much better solutions in the long term
2013-02-10 06:27:54	FFLaguna	Okay, that's fine. I don't think it's really a super practical solution for most people though
2013-02-10 06:27:54	sandbox	I always find it amusing when obese people have diet coke
2013-02-10 06:28:55	G-Flex	I believe part of the reasons diets tend to fail is because people /don't/ actually change their tastes or habits, they just expect to be able to eat the same shit except in magical non-fattening form, so they end up eating the same crap they always eat except with fewer calories, leading to a diet that is still probably not very healthy despite having fewer calories, and causing problems
2013-02-10 06:28:56	G-Flex	in the long term because they don't learn to eat food that's healthy for them in the first place, leading to more likely backsliding
2013-02-10 06:29:08	G-Flex	it's probably not super-practical for most people because most people don't want to fucking change or improve
2013-02-10 06:29:17	G-Flex	they want pills and cure-all solutions because that's what is promised to them

2013-02-10 06:30:07	FFLaguna	I think part of the reasons diets fail is because people lack the proper knowledge, and have 1) inappropriate expectations regarding timeframe, and 2) no way of objectively tracking their progress before results appear in the mirror
2013-02-10 06:30:10	FFLaguna	And that kills motivation
2013-02-10 06:30:27	G-Flex	sure
2013-02-10 06:30:39	FFLaguna	Most people who diet don't even know what a carb is or what calories come from
2013-02-10 06:30:44	FFLaguna	Or even what calories mean :|
2013-02-10 06:31:01	G-Flex	I just don't see what's thaaat hard about actually retraining your diet, I think it's largely a matter of listening to your body and realizing that you /should/ care about what you eat, and being open-minded toward alternatives
2013-02-10 06:31:18	G-Flex	I like a lot of food now that I didn't years ago, and there are actually reasons for that
2013-02-10 06:31:22	FFLaguna	Because I like vanilla ice cream with fudge on top
2013-02-10 06:31:38	FFLaguna	Now I can enjoy a 900-calorie dish every once in a while except it's only 700 calories now because the fudge is 0-calorie
2013-02-10 06:31:42	G-Flex	we are basically trained to treat food like it's candy, based purely on taste, which is a really silly way to approach your diet
2013-02-10 06:31:52	FFLaguna	Well
2013-02-10 06:31:56	FFLaguna	We make some tasty foods :|
2013-02-10 06:32:02	FFLaguna	Compared to other countries like Korea
2013-02-10 06:32:05	FFLaguna	They don't really use a lot of sugar in stuff
2013-02-10 06:32:05	G-Flex	I'm not saying zero/low-calorie substitutes are the devil, just that there are better approaches to this sort of thing
2013-02-10 06:32:20	FFLaguna	It seemed that way at first
2013-02-10 06:32:21	G-Flex	maybe it's possible the US has a shitty attitude toward food?
2013-02-10 06:32:26	FFLaguna	Like you were attacking it simply because it was fake
2013-02-10 06:32:34	FFLaguna	Because of the word "fake" and fake is bad
2013-02-10 06:33:19	FFLaguna	Oh, I got a six-pack BTW :D It's faint but there, and feelable~ I am the diet master
2013-02-10 06:33:55	FFLaguna	Without losing essentially any lean mass or dropping down in the weight I'm lifting in the gym
2013-02-10 06:35:45	G-Flex	well I think fake food is a bad thing, sure, but a little bit of a bad thing sometimes isn't horrible, especially when it's like
2013-02-10 06:35:47	G-Flex	mostly neutral in effect

2013-02-10 06:36:14	FFLaguna	Well, like, I love soda. I drink a lot of it
2013-02-10 06:36:43	FFLaguna	And especially when dieting, you do get hungry and it really has a nice effect on your appetite to put something tasty in your mouth and stomach, yet it's zero calories
2013-02-10 06:36:57	FFLaguna	I can still meet my dietary goals without cutting out something I enjoy
2013-02-10 06:37:06	FFLaguna	Just drinking water isn't as enjoyable?
2013-02-10 06:37:27	G-Flex	well it's not just about calories anyway, it's about where the calories come from
2013-02-10 06:37:55	G-Flex	300 calories of oatmeal fills you up for a hell of a lot longer than 300 calories of <insert extremely sugary breakfast cereal here> does, in my experience
2013-02-10 06:38:20	RavingManiac	Calorie-volume ratio

2013-02-10 06:39:09	FFLaguna	And everyone has different opinions as to whether proteins fill you up more, or fat fills you up more
2013-02-10 06:39:25	FFLaguna	And there are opposing academic papers on the subject as well

2013-02-10 06:45:36	G-Flex	I thought it would at least contain peanut protein
2013-02-10 06:45:37	G-Flex	it doesn't
2013-02-10 06:46:00	G-Flex	I honestly have to wonder what fake peanut butter made out of water, vegetable fiber, and thickening agents is like
2013-02-10 06:46:02	G-Flex	it sounds scary

2013-02-10 06:46:41	G-Flex	if I drink something with sucralose, it's okay for the first few sips
2013-02-10 06:46:44	G-Flex	but gets progressively worse and worse
2013-02-10 06:46:59	G-Flex	after I've drunk half a bottle of something it's progressed to this godawful chlorine-ish aftertaste
2013-02-10 06:47:11	G-Flex	not even an aftertaste, more of a weird back-of-the-throat taste thing
2013-02-10 06:48:52	FFLaguna	It can't contain peanut protein if it's 0 calories
2013-02-10 06:49:20	FFLaguna	And I don't think your body can assemble its own proteins from 0-calorie protein remnant amino acids or whatever

2013-02-10 08:52:53	Kidiri	My guess is that they'll kill Clara in every episode.
2013-02-10 08:53:00	Kidiri	So far, I've been correct.
2013-02-10 08:53:10	nuthulu	"Oh my god they killed Clara!" "You bastards!"
2013-02-10 08:55:40	nuthulu	Also kidiri I just watched the "coming soon" looks like there's sontarans

2013-02-10 08:56:10	Kidiri	I thought Rory offed them all.

2013-02-10 11:16:50	Hollywars	chemistry
2013-02-10 11:17:01	AfterShave	I actually almost wanted to do that
2013-02-10 11:17:09	Hollywars	its all i want to do
2013-02-10 11:17:15	AfterShave	But then I had the lower CCNA course in, whatever comes before university
2013-02-10 11:17:23	AfterShave	And fell in love with networks as a subject
2013-02-10 11:17:34	Hollywars	oh i just love molecules and whatnot so much
2013-02-10 11:17:44	AfterShave	I was thinking pharmacology
2013-02-10 11:17:50	AfterShave	Or something along those lines, when I was considering it
2013-02-10 11:18:13	Hollywars	oh
2013-02-10 11:18:19	Hollywars	nah i dont like bio enough
2013-02-10 11:18:22	Hollywars	too much memorization
2013-02-10 11:18:32	Hollywars	chem is just so beautiful
2013-02-10 11:18:36	AfterShave	I don't really LIKE chemistry and physics
2013-02-10 11:18:38	AfterShave	It's interesting
2013-02-10 11:18:40	Hollywars	and i got a B+ on my midterm <3333
2013-02-10 11:18:43	Hollywars	oh physics is awful haha
2013-02-10 11:18:55	AfterShave	But, yeah. I was thinking about medicines and drugs rather than whatever else
2013-02-10 11:19:00	AfterShave	Not plastics, that's for sure :P
2013-02-10 11:19:08	Hollywars	thats not really how it works though
2013-02-10 11:19:10	Hollywars	like
2013-02-10 11:19:12	Hollywars	pharmaceutical chemistry is huge
2013-02-10 11:19:28	Hollywars	almost as big as materials if not bigger
2013-02-10 11:19:39	AfterShave	It's still the kind that interested me more
2013-02-10 11:19:44	Hollywars	plastics?
2013-02-10 11:19:50	AfterShave	No, medicines
2013-02-10 11:19:56	Hollywars	oh yeah medicine is cool
2013-02-10 11:20:06	Hollywars	but my dad is a doctor and its just such a sacrifice :(
2013-02-10 11:20:22	Hollywars	and my grades werent great last semester so i wouldn't be getting in to med school afaik
2013-02-10 11:20:57	AfterShave	I have a friend who's dad is a nurse. He was studying to become a nurse as well
2013-02-10 11:21:08	AfterShave	He changed it to some kind of medical engineer after a year
2013-02-10 11:21:32	AfterShave	What's it called when you work, but in school?
2013-02-10 11:21:32	Hollywars	i dunno
2013-02-10 11:21:38	Hollywars	work-study?
2013-02-10 11:21:50	AfterShave	Going to the hospital and well, be a nurse but not full nurse
2013-02-10 11:21:55	AfterShave	I can't remember the name for that word at all
2013-02-10 11:22:02	Hollywars	internship?
2013-02-10 11:22:06	AfterShave	Yes
2013-02-10 11:22:13	Hollywars	I'm pretty sure i have a lab position this summer
2013-02-10 11:22:15	Hollywars	i'm so excited
2013-02-10 11:22:19	sandbox	student nurse ;p
2013-02-10 11:22:20	AfterShave	He left after his second internship. He talked about he was probably going to see people die before it
2013-02-10 11:22:29	AfterShave	And announced changing his studies after that
2013-02-10 11:22:31	Hollywars	i mean yeah my dad has had people die in his arms...
2013-02-10 11:22:33	AfterShave	So I guess it sucked
2013-02-10 11:22:34	Hollywars	and like
2013-02-10 11:22:40	Hollywars	bleed to death all over him
2013-02-10 11:22:47	Hollywars	yeah its pretty fucking awful
2013-02-10 11:23:04	AfterShave	Helping sick people is awful yes
2013-02-10 11:23:06	sandbox	your dad's a murderer?
2013-02-10 11:23:08	AfterShave	But sick people want care
2013-02-10 11:23:30	AfterShave	A much safer option is obviously to administer networks :P
2013-02-10 11:23:31	Hollywars	generally how it works is
2013-02-10 11:23:39	Hollywars	you either really really really want to be a doctor
2013-02-10 11:23:40	Hollywars	or don't
2013-02-10 11:24:02	AfterShave	I believe he wanted to become a psychologist by going the nurse route

2013-02-10 19:58:27	BlackGyver	I, for one, kind of wonders where the money actually went
2013-02-10 19:58:39	TWA	making things is expensive
2013-02-10 19:58:54	TWA	if its an internal team, just consider payroll, and 73k is gone in a flash
2013-02-10 19:58:56	BlackGyver	I've seen more content with a WC3 mod with ships (same gameplay)
2013-02-10 19:59:42	BlackGyver	The concept was pretty nice, but there wasn't just much to do
2013-02-10 19:59:58	BlackGyver	And most of the game consisted of grinding against bots
2013-02-10 20:01:21	BlackGyver	You can't just expect to see your game flourish amongst gamers when the features are close to nil

2013-02-10 20:35:26	TWA	So I get an abnormal amount of migrants to this fort. Like they come ALL the time. is it because I keep making more bedrooms?
2013-02-10 20:35:52	Spekkio	Do you have a lot of wealth on display to traders?

2013-02-10 21:05:32	TWA	So, it was my first time, in a haunted biome. and a sparrow (or something)
2013-02-10 21:05:54	TWA	was killed, and eventually its zombie killed like a dig or something…and well, there you go. FUN ensued
2013-02-10 21:06:35	therealfakemoot	TWA: yes, and they'll be completely useless
2013-02-10 21:06:41	therealfakemoot	TWA: Against anything with clothing
2013-02-10 21:06:58	Methodeux	Surely someone has survived in a Terrifying biome long enough to have some /real/ fun.
2013-02-10 21:07:00	TWA	haha, thanks
2013-02-10 21:07:07	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: I have
2013-02-10 21:07:20	Methodeux	I'd like to read about others escapades before I try it out myself.
2013-02-10 21:07:25	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: I acutlaly had a fort where I conducted a fair amount of science with the evil thralls
2013-02-10 21:07:29	therealfakemoot	that come from the evil dust
2013-02-10 21:07:45	TWA	Yeah I did well in a desert haunted biome once. Key is isolation. Ignore migrants, wall yourself in. Survival mode!
2013-02-10 21:07:50	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: The trick is that you get underground and completely seal yourself off immediately.
2013-02-10 21:08:17	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: you have to be prepared to accept loss of 100% of your immigrants
2013-02-10 21:08:30	TWA	haha, I win, I said all this first. haha
2013-02-10 21:08:30	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: A particularly bad evil biome will have evil dusts and rains
2013-02-10 21:08:46	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: So you have to get EVERYTHING underground RIGHT away
2013-02-10 21:09:06	Methodeux	So, the surface is perpetual suicide, eh?
2013-02-10 21:09:12	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: Not always
2013-02-10 21:09:17	TWA	its super fun watching the migrants run from the zombies though
2013-02-10 21:09:30	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: But if you have evil dusts or rains, wild animals or migrants will mostly likely be zombieified/trhalled immediately
2013-02-10 21:09:34	therealfakemoot	And they hang out on the map
2013-02-10 21:09:36	therealfakemoot	Forever
2013-02-10 21:09:42	therealfakemoot	Thralls and zombies don't migrate away like wild animals
2013-02-10 21:09:43	Methodeux	Nice.
2013-02-10 21:09:56	therealfakemoot	So isolation is the key.
2013-02-10 21:10:01	Methodeux	So, it's DF: L4D.
2013-02-10 21:10:09	therealfakemoot	Thralls are not immune to weapon traps
2013-02-10 21:10:13	therealfakemoot	Anything that will bisect them
2013-02-10 21:10:17	therealfakemoot	i.e. disc traps
2013-02-10 21:10:27	therealfakemoot	lower and upper body parts must be completely separated
2013-02-10 21:10:30	Methodeux	I'm still a newb at trapping.
2013-02-10 21:10:34	therealfakemoot	That's death for a thrall.
2013-02-10 21:10:42	therealfakemoot	and htat's it
2013-02-10 21:11:13	Methodeux	I suppose I'll make another regular fortress and be more innovative with traps.
2013-02-10 21:11:45	Methodeux	It seems like traps > military in most scenarios.
2013-02-10 21:11:46	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: The trick to good traps is a two tile wide corridor
2013-02-10 21:11:59	therealfakemoot	Methodeux: Mostly because the miltary system is clunky/incomplete
2013-02-10 21:12:03	therealfakemoot	Training is tricky
2013-02-10 21:12:14	therealfakemoot	Getting dwarves to equip the proper armor is trick
2013-02-10 21:12:20	Methodeux	Yeah.  No kidding.
2013-02-10 21:12:21	therealfakemoot	y
2013-02-10 21:12:25	therealfakemoot	Traps are easy
2013-02-10 21:12:27	Methodeux	Let alone archery training.  o.o
2013-02-10 21:12:38	therealfakemoot	And you can easily line up hundreds of rows of traps
2013-02-10 21:13:07	Methodeux	A goblin siege took down my last fort because I'd weakass military and no real traps.
2013-02-10 21:13:25	Methodeux	I'd a moat/drawbridge system which kept them out, but my dwarves had no access to water and were dying of thirst.
2013-02-10 21:13:29	TWA	cage traps.
2013-02-10 21:13:58	TWA	and bridges, make bridges so you can close yourself off as needed.
2013-02-10 21:14:30	therealfakemoot	Yup
2013-02-10 21:14:37	therealfakemoot	Bridges are perfect for isolating safely
2013-02-10 21:14:42	Methodeux	I'd rather mow them down in a hailstorm of blood and arrows than haul stuff off in cages.  It's undignified for a dwarf to pass up an opportunity to reduce an opponent to a more glorious stature.
2013-02-10 21:15:06	TWA	cage->strip->colloseum

2013-02-11 17:54:01	Zackariah	Oh i see
2013-02-11 17:54:05	Zackariah	I really like jolly bastion

2013-02-11 17:54:49	Spekkio	one of them stood in the water cistern for months and then died of THIRST.
2013-02-11 17:54:53	Zackariah	It's pretty much pretty ascii, but with pretty solid color tiles. (floor, wall, bridge, ect)
2013-02-11 17:55:10	Zackariah	most other items are just custom ascii
2013-02-11 17:55:12	BlackGyver	Joshiraku (じょしらく?, lit. Rakugo Girls) is a comedy manga series written by Kōji Kumeta and illustrated by Yasu, telling the everyday lives of five young female rakugo comedians.

2013-02-11 17:55:49	RPharazon|NB	The first two episodes are kind of odd but the rest are pretty golden
2013-02-11 17:56:01	Zackariah	My favorite all graphics tileset would be taking the tiles from phoebus and the graphics (dwarfs, golbins, ect) from ironhand. Which is simply a matter of replacing a folder if youre using lazy newb pack
2013-02-11 17:56:18	Spekkio	Hm. Jolly bastion DOES look good
2013-02-11 17:56:41	Spekkio	I notice that it's marked 34.10, but the latest DF is 34.11 - are they going to cooperate?
2013-02-11 17:56:47	Zackariah	Yeah
2013-02-11 17:56:56	Zackariah	I think it was some changes to minecarts
2013-02-11 17:56:59	Zackariah	Which i havnt used
2013-02-11 17:57:53	Zackariah	oh and if youre using lnp to install it
2013-02-11 17:58:12	Zackariah	youre going to have to grab the graphics folder out of the default ascii and put it into the jolly bastion foler
2013-02-11 17:58:22	Zackariah	otherwise lnp will get an error because it tries to find a graphics folder
2013-02-11 17:59:19	Spekkio	Maybe I'll just crap 34.10 to make sure
2013-02-11 17:59:21	Zackariah	Blacgyver: What shows are you interested in?
2013-02-11 17:59:24	Spekkio	....grab* 34.10
2013-02-11 17:59:32	Spekkio	I couldn't crap that if I tried
2013-02-11 17:59:52	Zackariah	Well it will still work
2013-02-11 18:00:01	Zackariah	Minecarts just may or may not have a correct texture
2013-02-11 18:00:36	Zackariah	I use 34.11

2013-02-11 21:21:42	Justin	Guys
2013-02-11 21:21:47	Justin	This is the best voting system ever
2013-02-11 21:24:16	Justin	Everyone country should have this system
2013-02-11 21:24:22	Justin	This is the best thing to come out of Australia
2013-02-11 21:24:24	Justin	other than roos
2013-02-11 21:25:21	@Makrond	all of the parties in australia are the conservative party
2013-02-11 21:25:28	Hollywars	lolol
2013-02-11 21:25:29	@Makrond	they just differ in degree
2013-02-11 21:26:38	Justin	how about this: http://i.imgur.com/HOtz9eH.gif
2013-02-11 21:26:44	@Makrond	but yeah preferential voting is pretty neat
2013-02-11 21:27:02	Justin	So your country is just as backwards as Malaysia, then?
2013-02-11 21:27:45	@Makrond	the green party here managed to get a decent chunk of votes by saying "hey you know if you vote us one and whatever party you actually want in power two, they still get your vote but you get to say 'i'm unsatisfied with the way you want to run the country'"
2013-02-11 21:28:18	Justin	heh
2013-02-11 21:28:34	@Makrond	the greens also aren't on the ballot in enough seats to form government iirc
2013-02-11 21:28:48	@Makrond	or if they are they'd need to win literally every seat
2013-02-11 21:29:00	@Makrond	that they contest
2013-02-11 21:29:22	@Makrond	and that's never happening
2013-02-11 21:29:41	Justin	so even the Greens are conservative?
2013-02-11 21:29:41	Justin	:V
2013-02-11 21:29:52	@Makrond	sure why not
2013-02-11 21:30:20	@Makrond	they don't have much of a social policy so it's a little hard to say
2013-02-11 21:31:08	@Makrond	I'm sure if they ever got a decent chunk of power they'd be socially liberal
2013-02-11 21:31:48	Justin	hah
2013-02-11 21:31:57	Justin	Apparently they are your typical anti-science hippies though?
2013-02-11 21:33:00	@Makrond	not... really?
2013-02-11 21:34:56	@Makrond	they're anti-industry and anti-nuclear but that's because industry doesn't give a shit about cleaning up their act and nuclear power's been turned into some kind of weird emotional moral issue instead of an actual discussion of the benefits, disadvantages and risks
2013-02-11 21:35:23	Justin	yeah nuclear power debates are more like something else these days
2013-02-11 21:35:24	@Makrond	and that's the same the world over
2013-02-11 21:35:43	Justin	so I suppose you vote for the Greens?

2013-02-11 21:36:09	@Makrond	seemed like the cool thing to do
2013-02-11 21:36:15	fcrick	heh i killed my miner he cut out the last thing supporting the ground above him :o
2013-02-11 21:36:15	@Makrond	this year? three years ago
2013-02-11 21:36:27	Justin	I see
2013-02-11 21:36:37	Justin	fcrick: Tis' not Minecraft
2013-02-11 21:37:17	fcrick	i wanted it to collapse...just not with him under it
2013-02-11 21:38:00	fcrick	hmm i guess i was supposed to build a channel into the aquifer first
2013-02-11 21:38:34	Justin	http://i.imgur.com/P0vljt7.jpg
2013-02-11 21:38:35	Justin	man
2013-02-11 21:39:19	Justin	I'm getting the feeling that the person who made this image is pointing the finger at the wrong thing
2013-02-11 21:39:38	Hollywars	haha
2013-02-11 21:39:45	Hollywars	no one has ever said women are brave if they hit men
2013-02-11 21:39:59	Hollywars	and women don't say "help me" unless they need help
2013-02-11 21:40:04	@Makrond	yeah p much all of that comes down to rigidly-defined gender roles in society that say men are X and women are Y and NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET
2013-02-11 21:40:06	fcrick	carbon credits are just this century's indulge scam
2013-02-11 21:40:48	@Makrond	shockingly feminism is more interested in breaking down those gender roles than some dickhead making stupid image macros in his basement
2013-02-11 21:41:05	Justin	the moment men give women true equality is the day where all sane women give true equality to man too :V
2013-02-11 21:41:49	@Makrond	it's more a case of fixing society than one group giving equality to another group
2013-02-11 21:42:25	@Makrond	the only thing is men will probably have to give up a bunch of good things that they enjoy as a result of being a privileged group in western society
2013-02-11 21:43:40	Justin	well I mean
2013-02-11 21:44:13	Justin	Yeah I suppose you're right
2013-02-11 21:44:14	Justin	:V
2013-02-11 21:44:28	Hollywars	like what Makrond
2013-02-11 21:44:49	Justin	but have you seen the short-lived femitheist blog
2013-02-11 21:45:05	@Makrond	the the ability to be a shitheel in public without significant repercussions
2013-02-11 21:46:08	Hollywars	shitheel?

2013-02-11 21:47:28	@Makrond	you know when a guy does something that makes you think "i'm going to fucking punch this dude right in his stupid face" but then you don't
2013-02-11 21:47:36	@Makrond	chances are he's being a shitheel
2013-02-11 21:47:40	Justin	also the whole "
2013-02-11 21:47:45	Justin	men having to pay the bills thing
2013-02-11 21:48:05	Justin	stems from the fact that, y'know, men used to be the one with the money
2013-02-11 21:48:09	Hollywars	i mean
2013-02-11 21:48:12	Hollywars	im all for the whole
2013-02-11 21:48:13	Justin	of course now it's changing, women work too
2013-02-11 21:48:14	Hollywars	marry a rich montreal heiress
2013-02-11 21:48:19	Hollywars	have her pay for my education and life
2013-02-11 21:48:23	Justin	also coincidentally many women pay the bills now
2013-02-11 21:48:25	@Makrond	yeah that has a lot more to do with the fact that society says true men are the sole breadwinners
2013-02-11 21:48:33	Justin	instead this guy is saying
2013-02-11 21:48:46	Justin	"waaaaah waaaaah WOMEN EXPECT MEN TO PAY FOR THE BILLS"
2013-02-11 21:48:48	fcrick	so how would you get water if you only have salt water?
2013-02-11 21:48:54	Justin	fcrick: build a well
2013-02-11 21:48:56	Hollywars	pump
2013-02-11 21:48:56	Justin	or pump
2013-02-11 21:49:05	Hollywars	but also women make less money for the same work
2013-02-11 21:49:22	Justin	yes
2013-02-11 21:49:30	Justin	and instead of analysing the whole situation
2013-02-11 21:49:40	@Makrond	my dad often has to compete with the women he dates over who's going to pay the bill :V
2013-02-11 21:49:40	Justin	they just take things at face value and say "hear the plight of males"
2013-02-11 21:49:56	Justin	yeah in places where women are paid fairly I'm pretty sure many women pay the bills too
2013-02-11 21:50:19	Justin	hell
2013-02-11 21:50:30	Justin	my sister was eating dinner with me and my parents
2013-02-11 21:50:38	Justin	and instead of the waiter giving the bill to my dad
2013-02-11 21:50:42	Justin	the waiter gave it to my sister
2013-02-11 21:51:12	fcrick	if i melt ocean ice does it give salt water?
2013-02-11 21:52:15	@Makrond	the waiter SHOULD give the bill to whoever asks for it
2013-02-11 21:52:24	@Makrond	assuming someone does ask
2013-02-11 21:52:28	fcrick	meh what difference does it make
2013-02-11 21:52:36	@Makrond	or else put it in a neutral position on the table
2013-02-11 21:52:37	fcrick	bill gets paid who cares
2013-02-11 21:52:44	Justin	I forgot who asked for the bill
2013-02-11 21:52:55	Justin	but tradition in ye olde days says that you give it to the elderly man
2013-02-11 21:53:04	@Makrond	eh it's got more to do with serving etiquette than equality
2013-02-11 21:53:12	Justin	yeah
2013-02-11 21:53:20	fcrick	all this hubbub about the bill all you'll do is offend snooty ppl
2013-02-11 21:53:26	@Makrond	same as how you put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork
2013-02-11 21:53:29	Methodeux	Damn.  A seriously epic event went down for my newbie stonekeep.
2013-02-11 21:53:36	Justin	I've heard that some places give the menu with the price only to the "man of the house"
2013-02-11 21:53:44	Justin	and for the rest they give the menu without the price
2013-02-11 21:53:57	Justin	but no one does that anymore
2013-02-11 21:53:57	@Makrond	fcrick: actually I'm pointing out how to least offend snooty people :P
2013-02-11 21:54:00	Methodeux	Goblins ambushed my place.  No one was around to pull the lever for the front gate.
2013-02-11 21:54:11	Methodeux	Blood and guts..  everywhere..
2013-02-11 21:54:11	Justin	what's a snooty person again
2013-02-11 21:54:12	fcrick	man i'm glad i'm not a waiter
2013-02-11 21:54:24	fcrick	ppl just find any excuse to just be a total dick
2013-02-11 21:55:02	Methodeux	Iron gear is useless.  :|
2013-02-11 21:55:08	Justin	also I love how people scream at waiters when they're supposed to scream at the management
2013-02-11 21:55:17	Justin	Methodeux: Welcome to DF
2013-02-11 21:55:45	@Makrond	always remember to tip your serving staff (unless you live in a country where serving staff get paid a fair wage instead of having to rely on tips for a good 50% of their income)
2013-02-11 21:55:50	fcrick	woah a Raven Woman
2013-02-11 21:55:57	@Makrond	(in which case tipping is optional)
2013-02-11 21:56:06	Methodeux	I think I managed to avoid a fatal tantrum spiral, though.
2013-02-11 21:56:13	Methodeux	I just had to kill a few berserking children.  x.x
2013-02-11 21:56:33	Justin	Tips aren't a thing here
2013-02-11 21:56:34	Justin	at all
2013-02-11 21:56:37	Justin	No one leaves tips,ever
2013-02-11 21:57:02	Justin	that's because there's a service charge
2013-02-11 21:57:09	@Makrond	well to be fair that's because /everyone/ is woefully underpaid
2013-02-11 21:57:10	@Makrond	:V
2013-02-11 21:57:36	Justin	even you
2013-02-11 21:57:42	Justin	:>V
2013-02-11 21:58:51	@Makrond	that was supposed to be everyone in malaysia but oh wel
2013-02-11 21:59:08	Justin	yeah I could infer that

2013-02-11 22:00:32	fcrick	so how do i keep my livestock alive when there's no grass?
2013-02-11 22:00:43	Justin	they die
2013-02-11 22:00:44	Justin	I suppose
2013-02-11 22:03:11	therealfakemoot	fcrick: There's quite a few animals that are physically impossible to keep alive
2013-02-11 22:03:23	therealfakemoot	fcrick: They have hunger rates that increase faster than it's physically possible for them to eat

2013-02-11 22:29:20	Hollywars	GauHelldragon thats it?
2013-02-11 22:29:24	Justin	I've always been wanting to return to Runescape for nostalgia reasons
2013-02-11 22:29:29	Justin	as it's the first MMORPG I've ever played
2013-02-11 22:29:39	Justin	and it's the only MMORPG in which I've invested a lot of time into it
2013-02-11 22:29:40	GauHelldragon	it's the 4th most abundent
2013-02-11 22:29:42	Justin	as well as money
2013-02-11 22:29:50	Hollywars	GauHelldragon ok that makes more sense
2013-02-11 22:29:52	Justin	I've built myself a nice house and all
2013-02-11 22:29:56	Justin	got some nice equipment
2013-02-11 22:30:07	Justin	But I return to Runescape.com and all I see is terrible shit
2013-02-11 22:30:13	GauHelldragon	if i had to guess, i'd say the 3 most common are
2013-02-11 22:30:20	GauHelldragon	oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
2013-02-11 22:30:20	Hollywars	hydrogen and carbon
2013-02-11 22:30:22	Justin	microtransactions and membership price hike

2013-02-11 22:30:39	Hollywars	eh its really hard to say GauHelldragon
2013-02-11 22:30:42	Justin	anyway uh
2013-02-11 22:30:42	GauHelldragon	since human is what like 70% water
2013-02-11 22:30:44	Methodeux	They moved it all to my hospital
2013-02-11 22:30:49	Justin	Runescape hiked up the price of its membership
2013-02-11 22:30:50	GauHelldragon	and water has twice as much oxygen
2013-02-11 22:30:53	GauHelldragon	wait
2013-02-11 22:30:53	Methodeux	I'm guessing it's a bug related to stocking hospital chests.

2013-02-11 22:30:55	Justin	whyy
2013-02-11 22:30:56	GauHelldragon	twice as much hydrogen

2013-02-11 22:30:59	Hollywars	lol
2013-02-11 22:30:59	GauHelldragon	yes so
2013-02-11 22:31:04	GauHelldragon	well
2013-02-11 22:31:11	GauHelldragon	oxygen also weighs more than hydrogen
2013-02-11 22:31:13	GauHelldragon	by a lot!
2013-02-11 22:31:20	Hollywars	are we talking by weight or by lik
2013-02-11 22:31:21	Hollywars	like amount
2013-02-11 22:31:32	GauHelldragon	weight
2013-02-11 22:31:36	Hollywars	o
2013-02-11 22:31:38	Justin	everyone knows H2O is HYDROGEN
2013-02-11 22:31:53	Hollywars	and actually i read that the body is not actually 70% water

2013-02-11 22:32:29	Justin	and 50% black hole
2013-02-11 22:32:31	Justin	it's true
2013-02-11 22:32:33	Hollywars	i just dont believe it
2013-02-11 22:32:35	Justin	there are studies on this
2013-02-11 22:32:41	GauHelldragon	it looks like it's more like 60^

2013-02-11 22:37:52	Hollywars	but there is just so much bullshit floating around
2013-02-11 22:38:00	Justin	man
2013-02-11 22:38:06	Hollywars	like i can't not be skeptical
2013-02-11 22:38:10	Hollywars	about anything involving chemistry lol
2013-02-11 22:38:11	Justin	RuneScape is so depressing I think I'm going to cry
2013-02-11 22:38:19	Hollywars	its ok Justin
2013-02-11 22:39:00	Hollywars	"When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things."
2013-02-11 22:39:24	Justin	I mean
2013-02-11 22:39:34	Justin	I still want to go back to RuneScape every now and again
2013-02-11 22:39:36	Justin	and enjoy some nostalgia
2013-02-11 22:39:40	Justin	especially the music and all
2013-02-11 22:39:48	Hollywars	Justin its ok
2013-02-11 22:39:50	Hollywars	things change
2013-02-11 22:39:50	Hollywars	we change
2013-02-11 22:39:56	Justin	also just spend time in my own home in which I have invested a great deal in
2013-02-11 22:40:06	Justin	I remember reading a ton of guides and trying to optimize my money-making methods
2013-02-11 22:40:06	Justin	:V
2013-02-11 22:40:11	Justin	and doing some farming
2013-02-11 22:40:18	Justin	the quests in RuneScape were pretty great for an MMO
2013-02-11 22:40:30	Justin	but now RuneScape is so genuinely shitty that I can't even log in anymore
2013-02-11 22:40:30	Justin	:(
2013-02-11 22:40:41	fcrick	anyone play GW2?
2013-02-11 22:41:03	Justin	I still have a ton of quests I haven't finished in RuneScape yet
2013-02-11 22:41:07	Justin	I was looking forward to finishing them
2013-02-11 22:41:21	Justin	But it appears that now I can't
2013-02-11 22:41:39	Justin	Also it appears that the amount of players in RuneScape has dropped tremendously
2013-02-11 22:41:51	Justin	anyway the new combat system in RuneScape was rather interesting
2013-02-11 22:41:55	Justin	is*
2013-02-11 22:41:59	Justin	but I don't think I'll ever try it
2013-02-11 22:42:10	Hollywars	goodnight
2013-02-11 22:42:21	Justin	okay
2013-02-11 22:42:29	Justin	yeah I'm going to have to say goodbye to RuneScape
2013-02-11 22:42:41	Justin	I really hope the number of players in RuneScape dwindle to the point where Jagex takes a hint
2013-02-11 22:42:49	Justin	and removes all the bullshit that they've done to the same
2013-02-11 22:42:51	Justin	and lower the price
2013-02-11 22:42:53	Hollywars	Justin its ok
2013-02-11 22:42:56	Justin	I might be happy then :D

2013-02-11 22:51:51	Justin	oh
2013-02-11 22:51:53	Justin	so the pope did resign
2013-02-11 22:51:54	Justin	that's strange

2013-02-12 08:15:03	Justin	I really wonder why people are saying that even high-end PCs are having trouble emulating the PS2
2013-02-12 08:15:17	Justin	My computer is medium-high end at most
2013-02-12 08:15:20	Kidiri	Because people are idiots.
2013-02-12 08:15:24	Justin	and it runs PS2 games almost smoothly
2013-02-12 08:15:32	Justin	A few hiccups when you start it but once it's running it goes smooth
2013-02-12 08:15:50	RPharazon|NB	It depends on the game sometimes
2013-02-12 08:15:52	Spekkio	wake me when we can emulate all the n64 stuff properly

2013-02-12 08:16:10	RPharazon|NB	It's hard to emulate the Ratchet and Clank games as well as the Jak games thanks to the way the devs handled textures

2013-02-12 08:16:25	RPharazon|NB	To the point where you can either have wonky textures or poor performance

2013-02-12 08:17:28	Spekkio	This makes me laugh pretty hard
2013-02-12 08:17:39	Justin	but that's a problem with the devs using a rather unique way of handling things
2013-02-12 08:17:43	Justin	rather than total emulation failure

2013-02-12 10:01:12	therealfakemoot	Yeah
2013-02-12 10:01:16	therealfakemoot	your manager should have zero labours enabled
2013-02-12 10:01:19	AfterShave	Maybe he's partying hard in the statue room?
2013-02-12 10:01:28	Methodeux	I'll doublecheck the new guy
2013-02-12 10:01:30	AfterShave	That's the best "job" by the way

2013-02-12 10:02:34	therealfakemoot	I do
2013-02-12 10:02:38	therealfakemoot	Eventually
2013-02-12 10:02:47	AfterShave	Like, make a small "common room" in each neighborhood of rooms
2013-02-12 10:02:52	therealfakemoot	AfterShave: The way I do it is I've got a drone class with almost every single labour enabled

2013-02-12 10:03:16	AfterShave	I only segregate into nobles and non nobles
2013-02-12 10:03:34	therealfakemoot	and then...a farmer class that has ALL farming labours enabled

2013-02-12 10:03:44	AfterShave	No, I do not kill my nobles with accidents. I pamper them and give them gem windows to look down at the filthy peasants from their balconines

2013-02-12 10:07:12	therealfakemoot	I believe so
2013-02-12 10:07:12	Kidiri	In an ideal case, you'd be using slade statues.
2013-02-12 10:07:16	therealfakemoot	hah
2013-02-12 10:07:19	AfterShave	Meaning I could make a pyramid shaped room that would be covered in death
2013-02-12 10:07:22	therealfakemoot	I wouldn't use slade
2013-02-12 10:07:35	therealfakemoot	my dwarves would take a hundred years to move one

2013-02-12 10:24:13	AfterShave	Not many?
2013-02-12 10:24:15	therealfakemoot	Depends on CPU speed and goblin speed
2013-02-12 10:24:27	AfterShave	Why would it depend on cpu
2013-02-12 10:24:36	Kidiri	Depends on goblin speed alone.
2013-02-12 10:24:45	Methodeux	I suppose I'll just calculate using one-step increments
2013-02-12 10:24:49	Kidiri	FPS isn't the FPS you'd expect.
2013-02-12 10:25:39	Methodeux	Probably about 10 steps, judging by the average walking speed of the unladen non-African dwarf.

2013-02-12 22:47:42	Spekkio	The simplest possible one - without an E2 chip - can be thrown together in a few minutes and is perfectly effective, but it can only go between two pre-set points and can be easily interfered with
2013-02-12 22:47:43	Retro	with a keyboard, i assume
2013-02-12 22:49:06	Spekkio	...actually I think I know how to do this
2013-02-12 22:49:35	Spekkio	I need to write a function that, when run, will get a list of all of a particular prop in the world (and save a list of the location of each one)
2013-02-12 22:49:45	Spekkio	then iterate through the list for each teleport.
2013-02-12 22:50:05	Spekkio	Then it won't matter if someone moves the props.
2013-02-12 22:50:20	Spekkio	or puts down extra ones

2013-02-13 04:52:22	Spekkio	As I understand it they DID deploy tear gas... particularly a kind of tear gas grenade that is known to be capable of starting fires
2013-02-13 04:52:39	Spekkio	so of course they throw SEVEN of them into a wood cabin.
2013-02-13 04:54:05	AfterShave	Because that's not excessive at all, even if they didn't start fires

2013-02-13 05:10:55	Justin|2	guys
2013-02-13 05:10:56	Justin|2	the OUYA
2013-02-13 05:11:03	Justin|2	a new version of the OUYA will be released every year
2013-02-13 05:11:11	Justin|2	SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN
2013-02-13 05:14:16	sandbox	heard that last week
2013-02-13 05:14:28	Justin|2	OUYA OUYA OUYA!!!!
2013-02-13 05:14:39	Justin|2	also the GameKlip looks really cool
2013-02-13 05:14:46	Justin|2	Too bad it only works for overpriced PS3 controllers :(
2013-02-13 05:14:46	sandbox	you must be in a lot of pain
2013-02-13 05:14:52	Justin|2	why?
2013-02-13 05:14:58	sandbox	OUYA OUYA OUYA!!!!
2013-02-13 05:15:07	Justin|2	Well
2013-02-13 05:15:13	Justin|2	It's half pain and half enjoyment
2013-02-13 05:15:18	Justin|2	Anyway
2013-02-13 05:15:37	Justin|2	I really hope there are GameKlip models that support logitech gamepads
2013-02-13 05:15:52	Justin|2	Logitech gamepads are almost the same as PS3 controllers
2013-02-13 05:16:00	Justin|2	And are much, much cheaper than the DualShock controllers
2013-02-13 05:16:01	Justin|2	:)
2013-02-13 05:16:02	gargantuan	i don't get the ouya
2013-02-13 05:16:06	gargantuan	like the point of it
2013-02-13 05:16:07	Justin|2	Neither do we
2013-02-13 05:16:13	crowe	marketing
2013-02-13 05:16:20	Justin|2	Guys
2013-02-13 05:16:24	Justin|2	The gameklip looks great though
2013-02-13 05:16:40	sandbox	EA says that the PS4 and nextbox are gen 4...
2013-02-13 05:16:41	Justin|2	you guys should petition the creator to make a version for logitech controllers though
2013-02-13 05:16:42	crowe	i'd rather just have a computer
2013-02-13 05:16:48	Justin|2	crowe: Yeah
2013-02-13 05:16:49	AfterShave	The OUYA is a cheap console for 99$, a year if you want to update of course
2013-02-13 05:16:55	sandbox	and that the Wii U is gen 3
2013-02-13 05:16:57	Justin|2	It's trying to be a consolized computer running on a smartphone system
2013-02-13 05:16:58	crowe	no
2013-02-13 05:17:00	crowe	it's a phone
2013-02-13 05:17:06	crowe	my phone can already attach to a tv
2013-02-13 05:17:10	crowe	and is as powerful as the ouya
2013-02-13 05:17:13	crowe	also it's a phone
2013-02-13 05:17:17	Justin|2	Well, I said it's trying to
2013-02-13 05:17:23	Justin|2	also supposedly the main point is the price
2013-02-13 05:17:24	crowe	it will never be one
2013-02-13 05:17:25	crowe	ever
2013-02-13 05:17:30	sandbox	and that the snes was before time itself
2013-02-13 05:17:33	Justin|2	How much is your phone? :V
2013-02-13 05:17:37	crowe	same price
2013-02-13 05:17:38	crowe	as an ouya
2013-02-13 05:17:39	crowe	B)
2013-02-13 05:17:45	Justin|2	Oooh
2013-02-13 05:17:47	Justin|2	Haha
2013-02-13 05:17:50	Justin|2	BUT DOES IT COME WITH A CONTROLLER???
2013-02-13 05:17:53	Justin|2	AHA!
2013-02-13 05:17:55	 *	Justin|2 cornered
2013-02-13 05:18:11	crowe	also modern smartphones are MORE powerful i think
2013-02-13 05:18:15	crowe	so it won't be able to run
2013-02-13 05:18:15	Justin|2	out of curiousity, what is your phone?
2013-02-13 05:18:21	crowe	all the stuff on the app store
2013-02-13 05:18:24	crowe	which will be hilarious
2013-02-13 05:18:29	Justin|2	did you just say "app store"
2013-02-13 05:18:30	Justin|2	nonononono
2013-02-13 05:18:32	gargantuan	newest ipad is the best thing around in terms of chip and screen
2013-02-13 05:18:32	crowe	b)
2013-02-13 05:18:33	Justin|2	it's the OUYA's store
2013-02-13 05:18:38	crowe	no, it's the google market
2013-02-13 05:18:42	crowe	:V
2013-02-13 05:18:42	Justin|2	no
2013-02-13 05:18:42	gargantuan	i have one for testing and only use it to read books on
2013-02-13 05:18:44	Justin|2	it's OUYA's store
2013-02-13 05:18:45	Justin|2	:(
2013-02-13 05:18:48	Justin|2	also
2013-02-13 05:18:49	crowe	no, it's the amazon app store
2013-02-13 05:18:50	Justin|2	it's Play Store
2013-02-13 05:18:52	Justin|2	:V
2013-02-13 05:18:55	crowe	:A
2013-02-13 05:19:01	Justin|2	Hah!
2013-02-13 05:19:07	Justin|2	so what is your phone?
2013-02-13 05:19:13	Justin|2	I really want to know
2013-02-13 05:19:17	crowe	a nice older model droid
2013-02-13 05:19:22	crowe	they're pretty cheap now
2013-02-13 05:19:26	Justin|2	I see
2013-02-13 05:19:29	Justin|2	so hardware's the same as an OUYA?
2013-02-13 05:19:35	crowe	somewhat
2013-02-13 05:19:40	gargantuan	i have a galaxy s2, there is nothing really around to replace it with :( and it's ancient and wearing out
2013-02-13 05:19:41	crowe	not the same things, but it's about as powerful
2013-02-13 05:19:43	gargantuan	which sucks
2013-02-13 05:19:47	Justin|2	also doesn't the 100 USD price point for the OUYA incldue the controller?
2013-02-13 05:19:58	crowe	yes, except that
2013-02-13 05:20:01	crowe	it runs android
2013-02-13 05:20:07	crowe	i.e. touchscreen games
2013-02-13 05:20:07	Justin|2	include*
2013-02-13 05:20:09	crowe	mostly
2013-02-13 05:20:10	Justin|2	Yeah
2013-02-13 05:20:17	Justin|2	I could see a use for emulation though
2013-02-13 05:20:27	Justin|2	and the more "hardcore" games
2013-02-13 05:20:30	crowe	i'd rather have
2013-02-13 05:20:32	crowe	a small linux systemj
2013-02-13 05:20:37	crowe	so it'd be a good emulator instead of a bad one
2013-02-13 05:20:43	Justin|2	Well I hooked up my PC to the TV
2013-02-13 05:20:54	Justin|2	and I can run Steam's Big Screen right now
2013-02-13 05:21:04	crowe	i'
2013-02-13 05:21:04	Justin|2	idk but Android's emulators are pretty robust
2013-02-13 05:21:06	crowe	i'm saying
2013-02-13 05:21:10	crowe	why isn't the ouya linux instead
2013-02-13 05:21:13	crowe	that'd be much better
2013-02-13 05:21:20	Justin|2	because lol linux!!!!111
2013-02-13 05:21:21	Spekkio	There
2013-02-13 05:21:25	Spekkio	I'm a freakin genius
2013-02-13 05:21:28	Justin|2	also the OUYA is a gimmick
2013-02-13 05:21:33	crowe	it'd support more things and you could, assume it was x86
2013-02-13 05:21:34	Justin|2	it needs all the fancy stuff
2013-02-13 05:21:36	Justin|2	Android's fancy
2013-02-13 05:21:36	crowe	run wine and thus windows games
2013-02-13 05:21:37	Justin|2	THERE YOU GO
2013-02-13 05:21:39	Spekkio	I found out what the problem with findByModel() is
2013-02-13 05:21:58	Spekkio	Basically, if you give it a string like "ar2_grenade" it won't find shit
2013-02-13 05:21:58	Justin|2	for some reason I don't think a linux gaming system is as marketable as an Android one
2013-02-13 05:22:06	crowe	that's stupid
2013-02-13 05:22:15	crowe	it's easier
2013-02-13 05:22:17	Spekkio	it requires a string such as "models/items/ar2_grenade.mdl"
2013-02-13 05:22:20	crowe	steam is on linux now
2013-02-13 05:22:22	Justin|2	the OUYA is pretty pointless as it is
2013-02-13 05:22:22	crowe	voila
2013-02-13 05:22:30	Spekkio	viola
2013-02-13 05:22:31	Justin|2	crowe: It wasn't when the OUYA was announced though :V
2013-02-13 05:22:36	Justin|2	violin
2013-02-13 05:22:50	crowe	there's still more "hardcore" things for linux
2013-02-13 05:22:50	Justin|2	anyway the OUYA has always been gimmicky
2013-02-13 05:22:51	crowe	CELLO
2013-02-13 05:23:03	Spekkio	KAZOO!
2013-02-13 05:23:11	Spekkio	bzzzz bzzz bzzzzzzz
2013-02-13 05:23:12	AfterShave	That's not a string instrument!
2013-02-13 05:23:24	Justin|2	anyway given how the OUYA is, it's only fitting it's using android
2013-02-13 05:23:24	Justin|2	:V
2013-02-13 05:23:34	Justin|2	also I must say that I got an Android phone before it became cool
2013-02-13 05:24:05	gargantuan	i fucking hate canadians, but GRIMES is awesome
2013-02-13 05:24:43	Spekkio	What I want right now
2013-02-13 05:24:48	Spekkio	well actually
2013-02-13 05:24:51	Spekkio	what I  need to check right now
2013-02-13 05:25:00	Spekkio	is if there's a way to make my E2 chip speak globally
2013-02-13 05:25:07	Justin|2	anyway
2013-02-13 05:25:13	Spekkio	because right now I'm pretty sure it speaks only in my personal charbox.
2013-02-13 05:25:16	Spekkio	chatbox.
2013-02-13 05:25:18	Justin|2	Releasing an OUYA every year is hilarious
2013-02-13 05:25:22	--	CaptainQ is now known as Tetrominon
2013-02-13 05:25:30	Justin|2	It's just bad ideas built onto more bad ideas
2013-02-13 05:25:36	Spekkio	if I can make it global, I'm adding Buttbot functionality
2013-02-13 05:25:52	Justin|2	Spekkio: Sounds like SS13
2013-02-13 05:25:58	AfterShave	IT does
2013-02-13 05:26:11	Justin|2	Anyway I'm surprised that the OUYA was even kickstarted to begin with
2013-02-13 05:26:12	Spekkio	buttbot: the heart and soul of ss13

2013-02-13 05:29:39	Justin|2	for some reason I read your sentences as a ballad
2013-02-13 05:29:47	crowe	i read it as bakelite

2013-02-13 05:30:30	Spekkio	what do you mean "still remember"
2013-02-13 05:30:33	Spekkio	it wasn't THAT long ago
2013-02-13 05:31:03	Justin|2	"but Uhrman said Ouya would provide the only TV experience for the game. You'll also be able to play it on Android and iOS devices as well as PC, Mac and Linux."
2013-02-13 05:31:11	Justin|2	Valve would be mad
2013-02-13 05:31:12	Justin|2	So mad
2013-02-13 05:31:56	sandbox	do you remember when the economy actually worked?
2013-02-13 05:32:01	sandbox	and in the game
2013-02-13 05:32:59	Justin|2	anyway uh
2013-02-13 05:33:09	Justin|2	the PR for OUYA is really dumb
2013-02-13 05:33:22	Justin|2	it's going to be released on Android and iOS
2013-02-13 05:33:24	Justin|2	too
2013-02-13 05:33:28	Justin|2	as well as the PC
2013-02-13 05:33:40	Justin|2	so there are 3 other platforms that you can play on the TV

2013-02-13 06:11:32	nuthulu	So you know how the Vatican was struck by lightning, then one day later the pope resigned?
2013-02-13 06:11:38	nuthulu	This gives me an idea
2013-02-13 06:12:10	nuthulu	The Vatican was using it's wealth and power to gather the corpses of famous kings,warriors, other popes etc, the last they got was Richard the third
2013-02-13 06:12:55	nuthulu	The lightning strike gave birth to their most powerful creation, an undead being with all the greatest traits of mankinds leaders, the ambition of Napoleon, the will of Alexander
2013-02-13 06:13:57	nuthulu	This new undead superbeing will be used by the catholic church to conquer the world..although there is only one way to stop him. Nuclear North Korean man, who was given superpowers in the nuclear tests

2013-02-13 07:04:12	Spekkio	When I place it, it returns an error because I'm trying to refer to the possible occupant of a pod which would be giving instructions to the chip through wires
2013-02-13 07:04:22	Spekkio	but those wires can't be connected until the chip is placed.
2013-02-13 07:05:08	Spekkio	anyway I think I've found a better solution to teach the chip what  pods it's listening to

2013-02-13 20:35:39	Zackariah	Reading throught he list of things toady wants to add to adventure mode looks amazing. If all of this stuff ever gets added the game would be amazing
2013-02-13 20:35:53	Zackariah	We can only dream :'(
2013-02-13 20:36:13	TWA	Anything on the horizon for Fortress mode?
2013-02-13 20:37:10	Zackariah	So far all iv seen is lighting and adding artifacts to world gen
2013-02-13 20:37:25	TWA	lighting?
2013-02-13 20:37:36	Zackariah	Coming up with histories for night creatures, such as why or how they were cursed
2013-02-13 20:38:01	Zackariah	Lighting    Proper environmental lighting    Construction and use of torches    Candles/lamps/lanterns
2013-02-13 20:38:13	TWA	oh, thats cool
2013-02-13 20:38:35	TWA	It would be heat to see torches/fire used in a weapon/ trap-like manner
2013-02-13 20:38:40	Zackariah	Thats one just of the ones he just would like to add though
2013-02-13 20:38:49	Zackariah	the night creatures is in development
2013-02-13 20:39:12	Zackariah	Most stuff is focused on adventure mode
2013-02-13 20:39:29	Zackariah	but if stuff like this gets added to adventure mode i wouldnt mind
2013-02-13 20:39:35	Zackariah	it would be as engaging as fotress mode
2013-02-13 20:39:54	Spekkio	on thatnote I think I'm going to try to get back into fortress mode
2013-02-13 20:40:27	TWA	I haven't even touched adventure yet

2013-02-13 20:40:41	Zackariah	he really wants to make the perfect rpg. A huge persisting world with a rich history to explore. And he wants to add in depth interactions with other towns. With each of them having thier own nobles and wars and trading and as an adventurer you can take a part in all of it
2013-02-13 20:40:44	Zackariah	Neither have i
2013-02-13 20:40:51	TWA	because it sounds like so much is in the works, and I enjoyy fortress enough to wait out the next update
2013-02-13 20:40:55	Zackariah	It seems so interesting but I tried it and just couldnt figure it out
2013-02-13 20:41:02	Zackariah	Thats what I keep thinking too
2013-02-13 20:41:39	Zackariah	I think adventure mode would work will with a ss13 kind of gui
2013-02-13 20:41:52	Zackariah	For easily choosing intents and aiming at body parts
2013-02-13 20:43:47	Spekkio	These worlds have too much civilisation!
2013-02-13 20:43:48	Zackariah	He wants to add huge army battles to fortress mode
2013-02-13 20:44:09	Zackariah	And improve sieges a lot
2013-02-13 20:44:46	Zackariah	Guilds and cliques in fortress mode
2013-02-13 20:45:06	Zackariah	and when two dwarves have a bif rivalry have a possiblity of dragging thier groups into it and starting fights
2013-02-13 20:46:07	Zackariah	Ability to order construction of items in detail with chosen materials, engravings, and gems
2013-02-13 20:46:12	Zackariah	That sounds cool

2013-02-13 22:52:05	@Makrond	presumably an xbox controller or something
2013-02-13 22:52:18	@Makrond	Justin: without context i would assume a third-party controller yeah
2013-02-13 22:52:25	@Makrond	like a madcatz or razer controller or whatever
2013-02-13 22:52:39	Justin	nah it's a PS3 controller

2013-02-13 22:53:01	Justin	controller*
2013-02-13 22:53:37	@Makrond	oh they're using the other definition of OEM which means 'included with the hardware' i guess
2013-02-13 22:53:44	Justin	okay
2013-02-13 22:53:48	Justin	so this is an official controller?
2013-02-13 22:54:02	@Makrond	looks like one
2013-02-13 22:54:46	@Makrond	box checks out, doesn't look like an obvious ripoff
2013-02-13 22:55:14	@Makrond	so yeah I guess they just mean it's a controller you can buy separately from a PS3
2013-02-13 22:55:48	@Makrond	really though if you have any reason not to trust it I'd go somewhere else
2013-02-13 22:55:54	Justin	Well
2013-02-13 22:56:02	Justin	The reason why I'm looking at this is because it's rather cheap
2013-02-13 22:56:08	Justin	not ripoff level cheap
2013-02-13 22:56:17	Justin	but it isn't exactly the usual price
2013-02-13 22:56:30	Justin	he's ordering in bulk and will ship once 5 people have signed up for the purchase

2013-02-13 23:01:22	Justin	"It is compatible one ... or you can call it AAA class."
2013-02-13 23:01:28	Justin	so this is probably fake?

2013-02-13 23:02:39	@Makrond	AAA class is apparently some indonesian/malaysian thing that means 'fake but 100% compatible'

2013-02-13 23:03:14	Justin	Well you see I'm thinking of using GameKlip

2013-02-13 23:03:32	Justin	and only a few ripoffs work
2013-02-13 23:04:06	@Makrond	yeah i'd look somewhere else then
2013-02-13 23:04:42	Justin	mmmhmm
2013-02-13 23:04:51	BlackGyver	When it comes to controllers, it's not always wise to look for mucl lower prices

2013-02-14 00:37:40	namad7	justin, what do you mean actual thing?
2013-02-14 00:37:49	namad7	0.99999... repeating being the same thing as 1 is a thing
2013-02-14 00:38:08	namad7	oh whoos that was a comment from 2hours ago, but no one seems to talk here anymore? so it's just a few sentences ago?

2013-02-14 00:39:11	Justin	someone on the bay12forums insists that 0.999...1
2013-02-14 00:39:16	Justin	is possible
2013-02-14 00:39:29	Justin	we all know that 0.999=1
2013-02-14 00:39:36	Justin	okay maybe I'm not clear enough
2013-02-14 00:39:49	Justin	someone thinks that putting a 1 after 0.999... is possible
2013-02-14 00:42:14	Energiya	0.999 is not 1, its 0.999. 0.999... effectivelly is 1, but not really its till 0.999...
2013-02-14 00:42:21	Energiya	still
2013-02-14 00:42:48	Justin	what's the difference between 1 and 0.999...

2013-02-14 00:43:00	Justin	(you can't find it)
2013-02-14 00:43:17	Justin	also no one said that 0.999=1
2013-02-14 00:43:19	Justin	woops
2013-02-14 00:43:21	Justin	just noticed my error
2013-02-14 00:43:24	Justin	haha silly me
2013-02-14 00:43:26	Energiya	no oyu cant, its effectively 1 but its still not really 1
2013-02-14 00:43:35	Justin	[16:39:21] <Justin> we all know that 0.999=1
2013-02-14 00:43:36	Justin	ignore that
2013-02-14 00:43:39	Justin	I forgot the ellipse
2013-02-14 00:43:39	Energiya	for all intents and purposes you can call it 1
2013-02-14 00:43:54	Justin	well there's some pretty big evidence that 0.999... DOES equal 1
2013-02-14 00:44:22	Energiya	got a link? (actualyl curious)
2013-02-14 00:44:23	namad7	in regards to 0.9999... it's not effectively but not really 1, nor is it for all intents and purposes 1, it's literally 1, it's defined to be the same number
2013-02-14 00:44:25	namad7	lol
2013-02-14 00:44:28	namad7	it's not evidence
2013-02-14 00:44:30	namad7	it's defined that way
2013-02-14 00:44:37	Justin	namad7: Okay, not evidence
2013-02-14 00:44:37	Justin	proof
2013-02-14 00:44:37	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 00:44:49	Justin	Energiya: Let me see
2013-02-14 00:44:52	namad7	basically in real number theory numbers are all defined as infinite sequences
2013-02-14 00:44:56	Justin	Also for even more stupidity
2013-02-14 00:44:57	namad7	in binary it's very easy to see
2013-02-14 00:45:00	Energiya	sorry, i'm a bit drunk, but i would love to see some proof for it
2013-02-14 00:45:05	Energiya	true
2013-02-14 00:45:23	Justin	a dude said that humans are terrible at understanding the infinity
2013-02-14 00:45:23	namad7	that .10000000000000000000000... and .011111111111111111111... are the same and it's only by convention that we choose one
2013-02-14 00:45:34	Justin	and a guy said "nope I can understand it 0.999...1 exists"
2013-02-14 00:45:43	namad7	so it's only convention that 1 is referred to as 1, instead of 0.9999... (mostly because writing an infinite number of 9's would be insanely stupid)
2013-02-14 00:45:53	namad7	it's googable
2013-02-14 00:46:01	Energiya	thats not true, ... indicates  the 9 goes on for infinity right?
2013-02-14 00:46:09	namad7	it's in a lot of textbooks about topology or number theory or real numbers or whatever
2013-02-14 00:46:11	Energiya	(that was in reply to justin
2013-02-14 00:46:19	Justin	yes
2013-02-14 00:46:29	Justin	because I can't type infinite numbers you see
2013-02-14 00:46:31	namad7	err what that guy was saying is true, in that he properly understood infinity
2013-02-14 00:46:32	Justin	neither can you
2013-02-14 00:46:35	Energiya	hehe
2013-02-14 00:46:44	Justin	namad7: ???
2013-02-14 00:46:53	namad7	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...
2013-02-14 00:46:53	Justin	You can't place a 1 after 0.999...
2013-02-14 00:47:02	Energiya	^
2013-02-14 00:47:11	namad7	in your quote i think you just forgot to press space between . and 1
2013-02-14 00:47:27	Justin	?
2013-02-14 00:47:27	namad7	anyways that wikipedia page has a proof, and prolly covers it well (i only read the first sentence to make sure it was the correct page)
2013-02-14 00:47:36	Energiya	cool, thanks namad7
2013-02-14 00:47:37	namad7	so if you're drunk and curious do what everyone does! go to wikipedia
2013-02-14 00:47:38	Justin	Anyway I don't see how 0.999...1 is possible
2013-02-14 00:47:45	Justin	care to prove it?
2013-02-14 00:47:55	Justin	or show it
2013-02-14 00:47:56	Justin	or something
2013-02-14 00:48:04	namad7	0.999....1 isn't possible but 0.999... 1 is
2013-02-14 00:48:12	Energiya	chekc the article proof is the first thing there
2013-02-14 00:48:13	Justin	what's the space mean
2013-02-14 00:48:20	namad7	so I just assume that it's a matter of lazy typing
2013-02-14 00:48:27	namad7	the space means nothing, it means break between words :-p
2013-02-14 00:48:34	Justin	haha
2013-02-14 00:48:41	Justin	no I mean "0.999...1" is not possible
2013-02-14 00:48:42	Justin	as in
2013-02-14 00:49:00	Justin	after a series of infinity 9s, you put a 1
2013-02-14 00:49:17	Justin	I don't think it's possible
2013-02-14 00:49:34	Energiya	well if its infinate then theres no end to it
2013-02-14 00:49:36	Justin	yes
2013-02-14 00:49:41	Justin	so where does one place the 1
2013-02-14 00:49:41	namad7	no I don't think that has any particular meaning of any sort, but when I see a sentence with no meaning, where it's possible for a single key press to change the meaning from none to something typical... I usually just assume the keypress was left out
2013-02-14 00:49:43	Justin	in that number
2013-02-14 00:50:08	Energiya	assumptions arent good, best to ask for clarifications =P
2013-02-14 00:50:46	Justin	so namad7

2013-02-14 00:50:57	Justin	is it possible that three be a 1 after 0.999...
2013-02-14 00:51:03	Justin	there be a*
2013-02-14 00:51:18	namad7	as far as i know that notation has no meaning
2013-02-14 00:51:40	namad7	at least none other than the notation I infered of the 1 not being directly part of the series of 9's at all
2013-02-14 00:52:06	Justin	ah here was the actual question
2013-02-14 00:52:06	Justin	http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=114094.msg4020289#msg4020289
2013-02-14 00:52:17	Justin	it's not 0.999... it's 0.000...
2013-02-14 00:52:17	Justin	my mistake
2013-02-14 00:52:25	Energiya	well if my drunk ass is readding this right it is a thing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity#Nonstandard_analysis
2013-02-14 00:52:48	Energiya	to the .999...1 thing
2013-02-14 00:52:49	Energiya	err
2013-02-14 00:52:50	Energiya	no nvm
2013-02-14 00:52:52	Energiya	i cant read
2013-02-14 00:52:53	namad7	oh
2013-02-14 00:52:57	namad7	0.000....1 does have meaning
2013-02-14 00:53:10	Justin	is it possible?
2013-02-14 00:53:17	Justin	I don't think it's ever possible because there's no place to place the 1
2013-02-14 00:53:21	namad7	well it's the inverse of infinity
2013-02-14 00:53:35	namad7	it's a stupid way to write it though
2013-02-14 00:53:41	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 00:53:43	namad7	because like i said that notation doesn't have any particular meaning
2013-02-14 00:53:49	Energiya	what would be the correct way to write it?
2013-02-14 00:53:50	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 00:53:54	namad7	but it's fairly clear that it's the inverse of infinity
2013-02-14 00:54:00	Justin	but there's no other way I can think of to say "to the infinity"
2013-02-14 00:54:14	namad7	1/infinity
2013-02-14 00:54:20	namad7	that's the accepted way to write it
2013-02-14 00:54:36	Energiya	sorry i ment like .999... with a 1 at the end
2013-02-14 00:54:48	namad7	0.0000....1 is bad because 0.000....9 or 0.00000...8439819 are all the same number
2013-02-14 00:55:03	Justin	does 0.000...1 equal to 0.000...
2013-02-14 00:55:08	namad7	and so in writing it that way you can lead yourself to think that you've written a number even though you haven't
2013-02-14 00:55:14	Energiya	so its reaall irrelevant?
2013-02-14 00:55:29	namad7	0.000...1 isn't valid notation really but it definitely doesn't equal 0 if it were to equal anything
2013-02-14 00:55:36	Justin	so what the hell is the inverse of infinity
2013-02-14 00:55:38	Justin	I would think it's nothing
2013-02-14 00:55:40	Justin	but it isn't
2013-02-14 00:56:01	namad7	infitesimal? sp ...
2013-02-14 00:56:15	namad7	the typical phrase is
2013-02-14 00:56:24	namad7	<elipson as elipson approaches 0
2013-02-14 00:56:37	Justin	oh
2013-02-14 00:56:42	namad7	or at least one common phrase
2013-02-14 00:56:48	Justin	so the opposite of infinity is approaching zero?
2013-02-14 00:56:58	namad7	well there's also negative infinity
2013-02-14 00:56:59	bartavelle	doesn't make any sense
2013-02-14 00:57:10	namad7	opposite doesn't mean much of anything
2013-02-14 00:57:15	bartavelle	all you can say is that limit 1/x when x -> infinity is 0
2013-02-14 00:57:18	namad7	there are additive inverses and multiplicative inverses
2013-02-14 00:58:05	Justin	"Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"0.999...", where "0.999..." needs to be interpreted differently from its standard meaning as a real number"
2013-02-14 00:58:08	Justin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal
2013-02-14 00:58:10	Justin	ha
2013-02-14 00:58:15	namad7	i guess it's a bit of a different beast than infinity itself because the reciprocal of infinity approaches a finite number whereas infinity itself doesn't
2013-02-14 00:58:54	Justin	the finite number being 0?
2013-02-14 00:58:56	namad7	anyways 0.000...1 is a reasonable way for a 15-19yr old math student to attempt to rationalize in his own notes the concept of the multiplicative inverse of infinity
2013-02-14 00:59:10	namad7	despite being mostly useless pointless notation
2013-02-14 00:59:32	namad7	it's still the sort of notation that would be widely understood
2013-02-14 00:59:50	Justin	intuitively I suppose the difference between 1 and 0.999... would be 0.000...1
2013-02-14 00:59:55	Energiya	widely understood but technicall incorrect?
2013-02-14 01:00:06	Justin	as noted in Wikipedia
2013-02-14 01:00:06	namad7	well it's not incorrect so much as meaningless
2013-02-14 01:00:07	Justin	I suppose
2013-02-14 01:00:12	Energiya	gotcha
2013-02-14 01:00:19	namad7	the following sentence will not be incorrect, nor untrue. 09jfa jri1h30 bnuoadbf209
2013-02-14 01:01:00	namad7	basically it's just a bad habit if anything? possibly the sort of bad habit one might derive from discussing math via instant messager or irc
2013-02-14 01:01:08	Justin	namad7 says that 0.000...1 is a great way for students to understand the concept of infinitesimals
2013-02-14 01:01:25	Justin	wikipedia says that " Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"0.999...", where "0.999..." needs to be interpreted differently from its standard meaning as a real number."
2013-02-14 01:01:29	namad7	it's not great, that's not what i said, it's just A way
2013-02-14 01:01:37	Justin	a way*
2013-02-14 01:01:37	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 01:01:46	Justin	but are you saying the same thing as Wikipedia is saying?\
2013-02-14 01:01:51	Justin	looks like that to me
2013-02-14 01:01:52	namad7	see 1-.9999... is also fairly bad because here's the thing about real numbers

2013-02-14 01:02:11	Justin	well Wikipedia specifically said that the 0.999... is interpreted differently
2013-02-14 01:02:14	namad7	the definition of two different real numbers is such that between any two real numbers you can find an infinite number of other real numbers
2013-02-14 01:02:15	Justin	in this case
2013-02-14 01:02:32	namad7	and since you can't find an infinite number of numbers between 1 and 0.999... they are in fact clearly the same number
2013-02-14 01:02:36	Justin	aye
2013-02-14 01:02:38	Justin	I knew that
2013-02-14 01:02:40	Justin	what I'm saying is
2013-02-14 01:03:00	Justin	Are you and Wikipedia saying the same thing about a way to think about infinitesimals?
2013-02-14 01:03:06	Justin	I just want to clarify this
2013-02-14 01:03:06	namad7	basically
2013-02-14 01:03:08	namad7	yes
2013-02-14 01:03:11	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 01:03:17	namad7	i'm saying that it's possible for a student to want to write 0.000...1
2013-02-14 01:03:22	<--	Frogger (~Frogga@Highway.Crossing.Frog) has quit (Smoke me a kipper i'll be back for breakfast)
2013-02-14 01:03:30	Justin	so, intuitively, let's say we destroy the concept of the real number for a moment
2013-02-14 01:03:37	namad7	however that's really part of 1-.999... when 0.999... is thought of the regular way (which it shouldn't be as wikipedia said)
2013-02-14 01:03:38	-->	Jay (~Jay@NewNet-1D0021B.client.mchsi.com) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-14 01:03:42	Justin	1-0.999...=0.000...1 right?
2013-02-14 01:03:45	Justin	I know this isn't correct
2013-02-14 01:03:57	namad7	that is the point i was getting at though yes
2013-02-14 01:04:04	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 01:04:10	namad7	it's not correct but it is clear enough of a statement that someone else might understand it
2013-02-14 01:04:13	Justin	and so this is a way to imagine about infinitesimals, correct?
2013-02-14 01:04:18	Justin	one of the ways
2013-02-14 01:04:39	namad7	sure yeah thats the point i was making, although it's like i said a pretty bad way
2013-02-14 01:04:47	Justin	okay got it
2013-02-14 01:04:58	Justin	Wikipedia says that students prefer this though
2013-02-14 01:05:05	Justin	Which you implied too, I guess
2013-02-14 01:05:08	namad7	well at a certain age yes
2013-02-14 01:05:24	namad7	i myself probably wrote that in my notes when i was 15 or 16 or whenever
2013-02-14 01:05:33	Justin	Uhuh
2013-02-14 01:05:43	Energiya	it does help with understanding it
2013-02-14 01:06:38	Energiya	i kind of wish i could remember my calc 1-3 and discrete mathematics classes at this point...
2013-02-14 01:06:39	namad7	i'd say it helps with understanding it vaguely quickly, whereas understanding it better would require backtracking and lots of prior explaination on topics such as "what is a real number" whereas a student who hasn't even ever heard the phrase "real number" will grasp it in that manner instead, yes
2013-02-14 01:06:51	Justin	anyway what's a better way of understanding infinitesimals
2013-02-14 01:06:52	Justin	namad7
2013-02-14 01:08:29	namad7	well in the 1 and 0.999... case the issue isn't that there's an infinitesimal distance, because see that would be confusing, in a continuous field of numbers you have the situation where all distances greater than 0 contain infinite space and so an infintesial distance becomes sort of a problem of taking the limit of infinity/infinity which has unknown results one must solve for
2013-02-14 01:08:43	namad7	so in that particular case it just helps to define what it means to be a real number in the first place
2013-02-14 01:09:11	namad7	really though 1/infinity makes the most sense when you're taking pre-calc or calc1 or whatever and learning about limits
2013-02-14 01:09:58	namad7	the wikipedia article on infinitesimals is a totally unrelated topic i didn't mean to bring up
2013-02-14 01:10:48	namad7	an infinitesimally small number is the multiplicative inverse of an infinitely large number is all i meant to refer to
2013-02-14 01:12:21	 *	Energiya hands namad7 a shot of whiskey. you sir, deserve a shot for being much better at explaining such things then most of my professors/TAs
2013-02-14 01:12:43	namad7	in fact that whole wikipedia article makes almost no sense
2013-02-14 01:13:10	namad7	it refers to lots of different things which were already contained in other wikipedia articles i'm surprised that page even exists the one on infinitesimals
2013-02-14 01:13:12	Energiya	the infinitesimals one?

2013-02-14 01:16:52	namad7	not what i meant to refer to :)

2013-02-14 05:32:02	apo	*twitch*
2013-02-14 05:32:19	Justin	uhuh
2013-02-14 05:32:39	apo	Yes, because 20A at 200V are the same as 20A at 5V
2013-02-14 05:32:52	Justin	Heh
2013-02-14 05:32:56	apo	It's not like one is 4kW and the other 100W or anything
2013-02-14 05:34:12	apo	Wall chargers waste a considerable amount of electricity. When a wall charger steps down the high-energy power from the outlet to the low-energy power that the device uses, it radiates the unused power as heat. The charger keeps wasting this power as long as it is plugged into the wall, even if no device is connected. USB charging, on the other hand, is prone to less electrical energy waste as the computer is already converting the power ...
2013-02-14 05:34:18	apo	... from the wall outlet.
2013-02-14 05:34:27	apo	so... 5W for a charger, vs 100W for running a computer
2013-02-14 05:34:28	apo	hmm
2013-02-14 05:34:30	Justin	heh
2013-02-14 05:34:37	Justin	also uh
2013-02-14 05:34:48	Justin	does connecting a USB cable to a wall plug count as a "wall charger"

2013-02-14 05:35:23	Justin	They say charging via USB is slower than wall warts
2013-02-14 05:35:44	apo	it is
2013-02-14 05:35:48	Justin	okay so
2013-02-14 05:35:54	Justin	From what I understand
2013-02-14 05:35:57	Justin	when people say charging via USB
2013-02-14 05:36:06	Justin	they mean plugging in the USB to a computer
2013-02-14 05:36:20	Justin	and wall charging means plugging the wall charge to a power point
2013-02-14 05:36:55	Justin	wall charger*
2013-02-14 05:37:02	Justin	so I have this wall charger wtih a USB port on it
2013-02-14 05:37:05	Justin	and you plug the USB cable into it
2013-02-14 05:37:08	Justin	what does this count as
2013-02-14 05:37:13	Justin	with*
2013-02-14 05:37:30	Justin	I'm assuming a wall charger
2013-02-14 05:37:50	apo	Are you arguing semantics here, or do you just not know the difference between a separate USB charging thing and a PC?
2013-02-14 05:38:10	Justin	I'm dumb
2013-02-14 05:38:13	Justin	if that says anything
2013-02-14 05:38:22	Justin	I'm not even sure if I'm arguing the semantics or not
2013-02-14 05:38:28	Justin	I thought I was but I'm not sure
2013-02-14 05:38:29	Justin	???
2013-02-14 05:38:32	 *	Justin is confused
2013-02-14 05:38:41	apo	USB is standardized. A PC has to be able to supply 0.5A to a USB device.
2013-02-14 05:38:53	Justin	yes
2013-02-14 05:38:59	apo	The USB chargers are just 'okay so we have these two wires that need 5V, don't care about the current'
2013-02-14 05:39:17	Justin	so if you plug a USB cable into a wall charger
2013-02-14 05:39:20	apo	so they can supply 200mA, 500mA, 2A, whatever
2013-02-14 05:39:25	Justin	does it count as a wall charger or a USB charger
2013-02-14 05:39:39	apo	wall
2013-02-14 05:39:41	Justin	when they say that "a wall charger charges faster than a USB charger"
2013-02-14 05:39:42	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 05:39:52	Justin	also I know I just learned this in physics
2013-02-14 05:40:00	Justin	but I forgot the difference between current and voltage again
2013-02-14 05:40:01	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 05:40:07	Justin	voltage is potential difference right?
2013-02-14 05:40:11	apo	yup
2013-02-14 05:40:20	apo	and current is charge per time
2013-02-14 05:40:35	Justin	so uh
2013-02-14 05:40:44	Justin	what exactly does potential difference say

2013-02-14 05:42:20	Justin	a current*
2013-02-14 05:42:31	apo	it's the amount of energy you need to move a charged particle
2013-02-14 05:42:37	apo	it's like height
2013-02-14 05:42:41	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-14 05:43:04	apo	to put something on your desk requires less work than putting it all the way up on a shelf
2013-02-14 05:43:28	@smeding	the water analogy is very useful for this btw
2013-02-14 05:43:51	@smeding	electrical current is like water flow, voltage like water pressure
2013-02-14 05:44:19	Justin	hm
2013-02-14 05:44:21	@smeding	well, water pressure difference to be more specific
2013-02-14 05:44:31	Justin	apo: Okay so
2013-02-14 05:44:41	apo	you can set your 0 where ever you want, anyway ;)
2013-02-14 05:45:01	Justin	an ampere is the charge per coulomb right?
2013-02-14 05:45:08	@smeding	no
2013-02-14 05:45:10	Justin	err
2013-02-14 05:45:13	@smeding	charge is measured in coulombs
2013-02-14 05:45:14	Justin	sorry that didn't make sense
2013-02-14 05:45:16	apo	Justin: A = C/s
2013-02-14 05:45:17	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 05:45:18	Justin	I mean
2013-02-14 05:45:20	@smeding	it's the charge that flows past a point in a second
2013-02-14 05:45:20	Justin	yeah that
2013-02-14 05:45:28	Justin	I meant to say "coulomb per second"
2013-02-14 05:45:35	Justin	but I somehow said "charge per coulomb"

2013-02-14 05:47:35	@smeding	if current flows into a junction (a point where two or more wires come together) it must flow out again
2013-02-14 05:47:41	apo	Justin: That you have a potential difference of 200 volts, and 20 amperes are going through the wire
2013-02-14 05:48:01	@smeding	well to be fair
2013-02-14 05:48:07	@smeding	"20A at 200V" means nothing without context :)
2013-02-14 05:48:12	Justin	apo: Yeah I get that
2013-02-14 05:48:14	Justin	but
2013-02-14 05:48:17	Justin	Okay well
2013-02-14 05:48:26	Justin	So how does it compare with 20A at 5V
2013-02-14 05:48:41	@smeding	there's 40 times more voltage is how it compares
2013-02-14 05:48:42	apo	(And since volts are joules per coulomb and amperes coulomb per second, that's 200*20*J/C * C/s = 4k J/s = 4kW)
2013-02-14 05:48:55	Justin	smeding: So more voltage meaning more energy?
2013-02-14 05:49:05	apo	more work
2013-02-14 05:49:19	@smeding	more potential energy

2013-02-14 05:49:34	Justin	so basically when my GPU uses, say, 200V
2013-02-14 05:49:42	@smeding	it doesn't "use" 200V

2013-02-14 05:50:46	@smeding	Justin: a GPU for example might draw 100W at 12V
2013-02-14 05:51:02	Justin	Wait what do watts represent again
2013-02-14 05:51:04	@smeding	power
2013-02-14 05:51:08	@smeding	energy per unit time
2013-02-14 05:51:13	@smeding	volts are potential energy, per unit charge
2013-02-14 05:51:14	Justin	oh right
2013-02-14 05:51:26	Justin	man how could I forget about watts
2013-02-14 05:51:29	apo	(and you get them by multiplying voltage with current)

2013-02-14 05:52:05	Justin	I mean the equations are nice and all
2013-02-14 05:52:13	Justin	but I'm still not sure how this thing works
2013-02-14 05:52:37	Justin	so my GPU is a resistor right?
2013-02-14 05:53:02	@smeding	no
2013-02-14 05:53:11	@smeding	your GPU is a complicated nonlinear circuit :)
2013-02-14 05:53:19	@smeding	what 'a resistor' means is
2013-02-14 05:53:30	@smeding	there's a linear relationship between voltage across the element and current through it
2013-02-14 05:53:38	Justin	well damn
2013-02-14 05:53:42	Justin	maybe a GPU was a bad example
2013-02-14 05:53:43	Justin	:)
2013-02-14 05:53:58	@smeding	a resistor is a resistor
2013-02-14 05:54:01	apo	Justin: Your water boiler is a resistor ;)
2013-02-14 05:54:12	@smeding	heating elements are often pretty resistor-like
2013-02-14 05:54:26	@smeding	incandescent bulbs are resistors except they heat up so their resistance changes as they get hotter
2013-02-14 05:54:26	Justin	ah okay
2013-02-14 05:54:32	Justin	that's why they use lamps as resistors
2013-02-14 05:54:36	@smeding	there's a lot of different circuit elements
2013-02-14 05:54:36	Justin	I suppose
2013-02-14 05:54:38	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 05:54:40	Justin	there's a name for that
2013-02-14 05:54:42	@smeding	Justin: they use resistors as resistors
2013-02-14 05:54:46	Justin	heat sensitive resistors or some shit
2013-02-14 05:54:55	@smeding	PTCs and NTCs, sure
2013-02-14 05:54:58	Justin	they use that for lamps
2013-02-14 05:55:08	Justin	a rheostat is a variable resistor
2013-02-14 05:55:08	@smeding	hm?
2013-02-14 05:55:20	@smeding	i only call the big ones rheostats
2013-02-14 05:55:26	Justin	well
2013-02-14 05:55:29	@smeding	we tend to call the small variable resistors pots :)
2013-02-14 05:55:32	@smeding	for potentiometer
2013-02-14 05:55:36	Justin	the only resistor I have actually seen in the lab is a rheostat
2013-02-14 05:56:01	Justin	anyway I recall learning about those heat-sensitive resistors
2013-02-14 05:56:03	@smeding	yeah, probably because it's easy to see how they work
2013-02-14 05:56:08	Justin	aye
2013-02-14 05:56:15	Justin	very easy, in fact
2013-02-14 05:56:19	@smeding	i've only used them like once
2013-02-14 05:56:27	Justin	anyway uh
2013-02-14 05:56:45	Justin	do resistors absorb the energy or what
2013-02-14 05:56:51	@smeding	no energy is lost
2013-02-14 05:56:54	@smeding	they just turn it into heat
2013-02-14 05:56:58	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-14 05:56:59	Justin	much like friction
2013-02-14 05:57:00	Justin	?
2013-02-14 05:57:09	apo	yup
2013-02-14 05:57:16	Justin	okay]
2013-02-14 05:57:28	Justin	so if I run a current through a water boiler
2013-02-14 05:57:33	Justin	what happens to the water boiler?
2013-02-14 05:57:39	@smeding	it heats up
2013-02-14 05:57:45	Justin	due to the energy being lost?
2013-02-14 05:57:48	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 05:57:52	Justin	I see
2013-02-14 05:57:52	@smeding	a voltage develops across it
2013-02-14 05:58:12	Justin	so this very same heating up is the reason why everything using electricity heats up?
2013-02-14 05:58:16	@smeding	if the water boiler is a decent resistor (that is to say the relation between voltage and current is linear) the voltage is given by ohm's law
2013-02-14 05:58:17	Justin	even though it is unwanted
2013-02-14 05:58:20	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 05:58:25	@smeding	well, it's not always unwanted
2013-02-14 05:58:28	Justin	sometimes
2013-02-14 05:58:29	@smeding	it's very useful in a water boiler
2013-02-14 05:58:30	Justin	I mean sure
2013-02-14 05:58:31	Justin	the water boiler
2013-02-14 05:58:33	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 05:58:39	Justin	that's what I meant
2013-02-14 05:58:41	Justin	anyway
2013-02-14 05:58:41	@smeding	but it's annoying in a cell phone
2013-02-14 05:58:45	Justin	or a laptop
2013-02-14 05:58:52	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 05:59:03	Justin	but I'm pretty sure it's more unwanted than wanted, anyway
2013-02-14 05:59:03	Justin	:V

2013-02-14 05:59:49	Justin	I mean
2013-02-14 05:59:59	Justin	as electrical current runs through a resistor there's a friction of some sort
2013-02-14 06:00:10	@smeding	it's different from but analogous to friction
2013-02-14 06:00:29	@smeding	it's not friction, but both it and friction are energy loss from moving things
2013-02-14 06:00:35	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:01:05	Justin	so voltage is basically representing the energy lost when a current passes through that object or?
2013-02-14 06:01:14	apo	Justin: No, but you can think of resistance as friction
2013-02-14 06:01:18	@smeding	it's a bit hard to explain
2013-02-14 06:01:20	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:01:22	@smeding	for me
2013-02-14 06:01:25	@smeding	think of it like water
2013-02-14 06:01:28	@smeding	if you have a narrow tube
2013-02-14 06:01:38	@smeding	pressure builds up, and less water flows through it than through a wide tube
2013-02-14 06:01:43	Justin	aye
2013-02-14 06:02:01	@smeding	a resistor is like a narrow tube, voltage is like pressure, current is like flow
2013-02-14 06:02:36	Justin	so we have a big pipe flowing through a narrow tube
2013-02-14 06:02:47	Justin	I mean
2013-02-14 06:02:49	Justin	the water in a big pipe
2013-02-14 06:02:55	@smeding	well
2013-02-14 06:03:04	@smeding	you have a complete circuit
2013-02-14 06:03:52	@smeding	you have a power source, which is eventually the turbines in a power plant but you usually just say that there's a constant voltage source at your line voltage at an outlet
2013-02-14 06:04:04	@smeding	so 230V over here
2013-02-14 06:04:13	@smeding	it's AC but the most basic stuff doesn't care about AC or DC
2013-02-14 06:04:17	Justin	so in order to read the p.d., you attach a voltmeter to the wires connecting to both sides of the resistor, correct?
2013-02-14 06:04:21	@smeding	p.d.?
2013-02-14 06:04:26	Justin	potential difference
2013-02-14 06:04:36	Justin	that's what I did in my experiment
2013-02-14 06:04:37	@smeding	to measure voltage you use a voltmeter, yeah
2013-02-14 06:04:58	Justin	and you attach the wires of the voltmeter to wires on both sides of the resistor, right?
2013-02-14 06:05:24	Afthartos	no wonder that i have been feeling a bit hazy the whole day. i have a fever. 38 degrees celsius -_-
2013-02-14 06:05:33	Afthartos	so... fun day at work...
2013-02-14 06:05:47	@smeding	Justin: voltage is never 'at' a point
2013-02-14 06:05:52	@smeding	Justin: voltage is between two points
2013-02-14 06:05:55	Justin	yes
2013-02-14 06:06:08	Justin	so in order to measure you connect the wires of the voltmeter to two points, right?
2013-02-14 06:06:12	Justin	before and after the resistor
2013-02-14 06:06:17	Justin	I recall doing that in my experiment
2013-02-14 06:06:20	@smeding	to both terminals of it, yes
2013-02-14 06:06:32	Justin	so how does the voltmeter take the reading
2013-02-14 06:07:34	@smeding	depends on the voltmeter
2013-02-14 06:08:11	@smeding	for a simple analogue voltmeter, there's a coil and the current through the coil determines how much a little pointer is attracted to it
2013-02-14 06:08:26	@smeding	a spring is pulling it back too, so for a given current it will always be at a given value
2013-02-14 06:08:36	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:09:03	@smeding	if you were to just connect it to a voltage source, well, the coil has very low resistance of itself so it would draw a *lot* of current
2013-02-14 06:09:11	@smeding	so there's a big resistor in series
2013-02-14 06:09:17	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:09:30	@smeding	this is also so it doesn't influence the circuit as much

2013-02-14 06:09:36	@smeding	because there's only a small current being drawn
2013-02-14 06:09:55	Justin	it says in my notes "Current flows from high potential to low potential"
2013-02-14 06:09:57	Justin	what does this mean
2013-02-14 06:10:30	@smeding	it means that if you have a voltage across a resistor, current flows from + to -
2013-02-14 06:10:51	Justin	I see
2013-02-14 06:11:05	@smeding	voltage is potential difference
2013-02-14 06:11:14	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 06:11:24	Justin	is there an equation linking current, voltage, and something else together?
2013-02-14 06:11:26	Justin	I'm sure there is
2013-02-14 06:11:36	@smeding	not in general
2013-02-14 06:11:52	@smeding	so if you have 5V across a resistor what that means is that one terminal of the resistor has 5V *more* potential energy than the other terminal
2013-02-14 06:12:11	@smeding	but uh
2013-02-14 06:12:24	@smeding	the relationship between voltage and current can, in general, be anything
2013-02-14 06:12:36	@smeding	there are relations given for certain circuit elements, like ohm's law for a resistor
2013-02-14 06:12:43	Justin	anyway uh
2013-02-14 06:12:45	Justin	about your water analogy
2013-02-14 06:12:45	@smeding	or an exponential curve for a diode
2013-02-14 06:12:56	Justin	you said that the pressure is like voltage, correct?
2013-02-14 06:13:08	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 06:13:16	Justin	but you can have pressure at a certain point
2013-02-14 06:13:27	@smeding	nope
2013-02-14 06:13:27	Justin	but voltage requires two points
2013-02-14 06:13:31	@smeding	pressure is also a difference
2013-02-14 06:13:32	Justin	?
2013-02-14 06:13:48	Justin	oh dear
2013-02-14 06:13:50	@smeding	the difference is that for water, there's such a thing as 'zero' pressure
2013-02-14 06:14:00	@smeding	for voltage there's no clear 'zero' point
2013-02-14 06:14:15	@smeding	but really
2013-02-14 06:14:26	@smeding	the water flow in a pipe depends on the pressure *difference* across it
2013-02-14 06:14:37	apo	until we get water with negative mass!
2013-02-14 06:14:39	@smeding	just like current depends on voltage
2013-02-14 06:15:03	Justin	"on the pressure *difference* across it"
2013-02-14 06:15:11	Justin	so it's a difference of a difference?

2013-02-14 06:15:58	@smeding	no
2013-02-14 06:16:24	@smeding	the problem is that i used 'pressure' there in a sense of absolute pressure, and in a sense of relative
2013-02-14 06:16:35	Justin	define pressure
2013-02-14 06:16:46	@smeding	'absolute voltage' is just a lot harder to define than 'absolute pressure'
2013-02-14 06:16:59	@smeding	pressure is force per area
2013-02-14 06:17:01	apo	Justin: force per area
2013-02-14 06:17:03	apo	smeding: ^5
2013-02-14 06:17:12	Justin	hm
2013-02-14 06:17:30	Justin	so there's a pressure at a certain point, yes?
2013-02-14 06:17:36	Justin	just that in the analogy voltage is pressure difference
2013-02-14 06:17:41	Justin	which requires two points, right?
2013-02-14 06:17:59	@smeding	you could say there's a pressure at a certain point, and people do that
2013-02-14 06:18:09	@smeding	but for flow what matters is the pressure difference
2013-02-14 06:18:20	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:18:24	@smeding	for electrical networks it's just very hard to talk about 'absolute' potentials
2013-02-14 06:18:31	Justin	so this pressure difference suits voltage in the analogy?
2013-02-14 06:18:45	@smeding	because there isn't a potential you can call 'zero' unless you make it up
2013-02-14 06:19:10	@smeding	whereas for pressure there is a thing you can call 'zero' -- you can say a perfect vacuum has zero pressure
2013-02-14 06:19:43	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:20:09	Justin	but the voltage cannot be zero because there will always be some difference between two points?
2013-02-14 06:20:16	Justin	due to energy lost even in that very small distance?
2013-02-14 06:20:17	@smeding	what?
2013-02-14 06:20:21	Justin	huh
2013-02-14 06:20:24	@smeding	voltage difference can be zero just fine
2013-02-14 06:20:29	@smeding	sorry, voltage, so potential difference
2013-02-14 06:20:46	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:21:00	@smeding	voltage drop is a function of current in a resistor, so if you have a resistance of zero between two points the voltage is the same
2013-02-14 06:21:10	apo	There is no absolute voltage because you have positive and negative charges, so you can go to plus and minus infinity, and set zero anywhere inbetween
2013-02-14 06:21:28	apo	pressure depends on mass, and there are no negative masses
2013-02-14 06:21:36	apo	so you can set a zero
2013-02-14 06:21:41	@smeding	a resistance of zero is hard to attain, but sort of possible
2013-02-14 06:21:58	@smeding	and even if it's not, in practice you can just call very low resistances zero
2013-02-14 06:22:01	@smeding	it makes a lot of calculations easier
2013-02-14 06:22:17	@smeding	network theory is a model of something a lot more complicated
2013-02-14 06:22:28	Kidiri	You'd be surprised ow many assumptions an exact science like physics makes.
2013-02-14 06:22:34	Kidiri	*how
2013-02-14 06:22:48	@smeding	namely Maxwell's laws, which is a set of 3D differential equations that are pretty damn annoying to solve
2013-02-14 06:23:00	@smeding	so given certain assumptions you can make simplifications to the laws of network theory
2013-02-14 06:23:07	@smeding	that is, kirchoff's laws and ohm's law
2013-02-14 06:23:07	Justin	so hm

2013-02-14 06:24:44	Justin	the pressure difference is the difference in pressure between...?

2013-02-14 06:25:19	Justin	so I can say that, for the area between the two arbitrary points that I picked

2013-02-14 06:25:59	@smeding	the difference of the potential at point A with the potential at point B is x volts
2013-02-14 06:26:13	@smeding	it doesn't imply anything for what's "between" those points
2013-02-14 06:26:34	@smeding	if there's no charge between the two points, there will be a gradient in voltage
2013-02-14 06:26:46	@smeding	in potential, really
2013-02-14 06:27:33	Justin	what's a potential
2013-02-14 06:28:22	@smeding	a notion of 'absolute' voltage that you can only really get numbers for if you pick a point and say that 'this is zero volts'
2013-02-14 06:28:32	Justin	what's absolute
2013-02-14 06:28:39	Justin	:(
2013-02-14 06:28:59	@smeding	it means here that we're no longer talking about differences
2013-02-14 06:29:21	@smeding	once we define what 0V 'means' on this absolute scale, we /can/ say "this point has 5V on it"
2013-02-14 06:29:22	Justin	so absolute pressure being the force per area at a certain point?
2013-02-14 06:29:45	@smeding	the difference, again, is that there's no strictly defined 0V for electric potential
2013-02-14 06:29:49	@smeding	while there is for water
2013-02-14 06:30:23	@smeding	Justin: well, absolute pressure means that we have a reference point that we call 0 pascals
2013-02-14 06:30:27	@smeding	pascals being the unit of pressure
2013-02-14 06:30:31	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 06:30:46	Justin	so what about zero that this absolute relies on
2013-02-14 06:31:04	@smeding	0 pascals is the pressure of vacuum
2013-02-14 06:31:18	@smeding	there's nothing there, so it doesn't exert any force outwards
2013-02-14 06:31:52	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:31:59	Justin	so we use the vacuum as a reference point, yes?
2013-02-14 06:32:09	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 06:32:37	@smeding	but for electrical systems there's no "vacuum"
2013-02-14 06:32:46	@smeding	so what happens in practice is you just pick a reference
2013-02-14 06:33:05	Justin	hm
2013-02-14 06:33:09	@smeding	in electrical engineering, you tend to have a point in the circuit you call 'ground'
2013-02-14 06:33:11	Justin	but a reference for what
2013-02-14 06:33:25	@smeding	something to call 0V so you don't have to talk about differences all the time
2013-02-14 06:33:34	@smeding	but only if you want to
2013-02-14 06:33:59	@smeding	have you opened up a computer and looked at the power supply cables?
2013-02-14 06:34:13	Justin	once or twice
2013-02-14 06:34:17	Justin	what about them?
2013-02-14 06:34:21	@smeding	there's four wires in a molex connector, red black black and yellow
2013-02-14 06:34:36	@smeding	black is ground, red is +5V relative to ground, yellow is +12V relative to ground
2013-02-14 06:34:50	Justin	anyway 'absolute' pressure is the difference between the pressure at a certain point and the pressure of a vacuum right?
2013-02-14 06:35:06	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 06:35:11	Justin	okay cool
2013-02-14 06:35:32	Justin	smeding: and what's a ground?
2013-02-14 06:35:36	Justin	oh
2013-02-14 06:35:42	@smeding	ground is a point you just call 0V
2013-02-14 06:35:43	Justin	the potential difference on the ground?
2013-02-14 06:35:48	Justin	ah okay
2013-02-14 06:35:48	@smeding	no, the potential
2013-02-14 06:35:54	@smeding	but it only works for that situation generally
2013-02-14 06:36:07	@smeding	so different situation, you pick a different ground
2013-02-14 06:36:32	Justin	so uh
2013-02-14 06:36:33	Justin	what's potential
2013-02-14 06:36:39	Justin	I don't think you've answered that yet
2013-02-14 06:37:17	@smeding	it's a bit hard to explain
2013-02-14 06:37:38	@smeding	really it's a quantity that's everywhere
2013-02-14 06:37:59	@smeding	but because everything in nature is about potential differences you can't say like
2013-02-14 06:38:04	@smeding	the potential here is 4V
2013-02-14 06:38:19	@smeding	well, you can, but it doesn't mean anything
2013-02-14 06:38:21	Justin	so are you saying that potential is subjective?
2013-02-14 06:38:31	@smeding	not subjective, just relative
2013-02-14 06:38:36	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:38:41	@smeding	it doesn't depend on who you ask, it depends on what you're comparing it to
2013-02-14 06:38:51	Justin	but if it's relative how is it different from "potential difference"
2013-02-14 06:38:58	Justin	since potential difference is basically relative
2013-02-14 06:39:13	@smeding	well
2013-02-14 06:39:23	@smeding	let's say V is potential
2013-02-14 06:39:41	@smeding	you can't say V1 = 4V but you can say V2 - V1 = 0V
2013-02-14 06:40:05	@smeding	which means that given V1 = 4V (this is a definition you make, not a measurement) you can say V2 - V1 = 0V so V2 = 4V
2013-02-14 06:40:28	@smeding	it's kind of hard to explain
2013-02-14 06:40:50	@smeding	the difference is that for potential the reference is implied, for voltage it's usually more explicit
2013-02-14 06:41:05	Justin	man you're really passionate about electronics
2013-02-14 06:41:07	Justin	but anyway
2013-02-14 06:41:33	@smeding	you it's kind of hard to explain though
2013-02-14 06:41:39	@smeding	but it doesn't really matter that much
2013-02-14 06:41:46	Justin	okay so
2013-02-14 06:41:54	Justin	to make a shitty analogy
2013-02-14 06:42:06	Justin	is it just like saying "this guy is good" if there's no one else to compare him to
2013-02-14 06:42:38	Justin	like I can't say "this game is good" if there's no other game to compare it to?
2013-02-14 06:42:59	@smeding	i think that's a bit too shitty an analogy
2013-02-14 06:43:04	Justin	oh dear
2013-02-14 06:43:21	@smeding	i mean someone else can say a different thing, you can't do that with electrical networks
2013-02-14 06:43:31	@smeding	there's an objective truth there
2013-02-14 06:43:47	Justin	so is the value for potential itself completely arbitrary?
2013-02-14 06:43:56	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 06:44:15	Justin	but the difference, isn't?
2013-02-14 06:44:39	@smeding	yup
2013-02-14 06:44:43	Justin	so
2013-02-14 06:44:44	@smeding	the difference is observable

2013-02-14 06:45:05	Justin	"this has a potential of 101V"
2013-02-14 06:45:22	Justin	and that I shall call it A
2013-02-14 06:45:36	Justin	and I take another object and call it "B"
2013-02-14 06:45:43	Justin	and I find that A-B=10
2013-02-14 06:45:44	Justin	V
2013-02-14 06:45:47	Justin	10V*
2013-02-14 06:46:02	Justin	hence I can say "B has a potential of 91V"?
2013-02-14 06:46:13	@smeding	yes, although they wouldn't be objects but points
2013-02-14 06:46:19	Justin	okay, points
2013-02-14 06:46:19	Justin	my bad
2013-02-14 06:46:36	Justin	likewise if I said "A has a potential of 91V, and B has a potential of 81V"
2013-02-14 06:46:42	Justin	that's also correct, right?
2013-02-14 06:47:08	@smeding	well, i'd make it more explicit that you're picking A as a reference there
2013-02-14 06:47:16	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:47:20	@smeding	but both could be true with different initial assumptions, yeah
2013-02-14 06:47:31	Justin	but if I continue picking A as a reference and say
2013-02-14 06:47:40	Justin	"A has a potential of 91V, and B has a potential of 80V"
2013-02-14 06:47:43	Justin	I'd be wrong, right?
2013-02-14 06:47:47	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 06:47:51	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:47:54	Justin	I- I think I got it
2013-02-14 06:47:56	Justin	hopefully
2013-02-14 06:48:28	@smeding	voltage and potential are interchanged a lot, because people pick a reference point with voltage as well a lot
2013-02-14 06:49:07	Justin	so voltage is relative?
2013-02-14 06:49:10	Justin	oh wait
2013-02-14 06:49:11	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 06:49:12	Justin	what am I saying
2013-02-14 06:49:14	Justin	of course it is relative
2013-02-14 06:49:19	Justin	potential /difference/
2013-02-14 06:49:23	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 06:49:38	@smeding	the difference really is one of definition
2013-02-14 06:49:46	@smeding	voltage is used in electrical networks
2013-02-14 06:49:51	@smeding	potential is used when talking about electric fields
2013-02-14 06:50:05	@smeding	electrical networks are a simplification of electromagnetic fields
2013-02-14 06:50:08	Justin	D:
2013-02-14 06:50:10	Justin	oh no
2013-02-14 06:50:24	Justin	okay so
2013-02-14 06:50:32	Justin	what's the difference between potential difference and potential, then
2013-02-14 06:50:46	@smeding	one is explicitly a difference, and one is a difference to a reference point
2013-02-14 06:51:00	Justin	hm
2013-02-14 06:51:07	Justin	ah okay
2013-02-14 06:51:10	Justin	so potential difference is, say
2013-02-14 06:51:13	Justin	"10-5"
2013-02-14 06:51:22	Justin	while potential is "x+10"
2013-02-14 06:51:28	Justin	where x is a reference point?
2013-02-14 06:51:37	@smeding	something like that
2013-02-14 06:51:39	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 06:51:57	@smeding	potential is about picking a reference point once and then reasoning in relation to that point
2013-02-14 06:52:07	@smeding	potential difference is a specific statement about two points
2013-02-14 06:52:16	Justin	so potential difference and potential are pretty similar, huh?
2013-02-14 06:52:24	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 06:52:32	Justin	it's just that one uses a reference point and the other explicitly states what the two points are
2013-02-14 06:52:44	@smeding	but i mean if you pick a reference and call it 0V
2013-02-14 06:52:58	Justin	it becomes absolute?
2013-02-14 06:52:59	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 06:53:05	@smeding	and the potentials at two points A and B are A = 10V and B = 20V
2013-02-14 06:53:17	Justin	p.d. becomes 10V, right?
2013-02-14 06:53:26	@smeding	then the potential difference between them is (0V + 20V) - (0V + 10V) = 10V
2013-02-14 06:53:50	Justin	neato
2013-02-14 06:53:54	@smeding	doesn't matter what i picked my reference to be
2013-02-14 06:53:58	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 06:54:01	Justin	difference is still the same
2013-02-14 06:54:05	Justin	because same reference point
2013-02-14 06:54:07	@smeding	so now that you know about this shit
2013-02-14 06:54:12	@smeding	let's talk about kirchoff's laws
2013-02-14 06:54:16	Justin	wait wait wait
2013-02-14 06:54:18	@smeding	nope
2013-02-14 06:54:23	@smeding	not gonna wait fuck you
2013-02-14 06:54:37	Justin	I still don't understand
2013-02-14 06:54:41	Justin	how does current relate to voltage
2013-02-14 06:54:47	@smeding	the answer is 'depends'
2013-02-14 06:54:56	Justin	???????
2013-02-14 06:55:22	@smeding	voltage is caused by having a bunch of charge carriers around, just like pressure is caused by having a bunch of water molecules around
2013-02-14 06:55:28	@smeding	charge carriers are usually electrons
2013-02-14 06:55:56	@smeding	so voltage is a measure for the density of charge carriers

2013-02-14 07:15:02	Justin	Smeding: Okay so
2013-02-14 07:15:33	Justin	back to the very thing that started this
2013-02-14 07:15:36	Justin	"[21:32:32] <apo> Yes, because 20A at 200V are the same as 20A at 5V"

2013-02-14 07:20:48	Justin	okay if I were to have two different chargers
2013-02-14 07:20:49	AfterShave	I have OOO, which is a rather large overhaul
2013-02-14 07:20:56	AfterShave	Which I hadn't used before, for example
2013-02-14 07:21:00	Justin	and one was "20A at 200V" and the other was "20A at 5V"
2013-02-14 07:21:02	Justin	which one should I get?
2013-02-14 07:21:19	@smeding	the one that suits your needs
2013-02-14 07:21:49	@smeding	one is not by definition 'better' than the other
2013-02-14 07:22:14	@smeding	charging a 12V car battery requires a voltage slightly over that 12V
2013-02-14 07:23:31	Justin	so uh
2013-02-14 07:23:39	kullervo	what are you charging with them
2013-02-14 07:24:14	Justin	a 12V car battery is basically a battery where the difference in the potential of the point before and after the battery is 12V?
2013-02-14 07:24:21	Justin	I need to get my definitions right here, first
2013-02-14 07:24:21	Justin	:V

2013-02-14 07:27:55	Justin	answer me, someone
2013-02-14 07:27:56	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 07:28:32	@smeding	Justin: yes, roughly
2013-02-14 07:28:51	Justin	also why do Bad Things Happen if you charge something with too much voltage
2013-02-14 07:28:58	@smeding	too much current will flow
2013-02-14 07:29:19	Justin	but didn't you say that there isn't a direct relation between voltage and current???
2013-02-14 07:29:20	@smeding	dissipating too much power
2013-02-14 07:29:22	Justin	:?
2013-02-14 07:29:30	@smeding	there's no generic relation
2013-02-14 07:29:39	@smeding	but we're talking about a battery so there's a specific relation for batteries
2013-02-14 07:30:06	@smeding	it depends on how precisely you model them but usually you model a battery like a voltage source in series with a resistance
2013-02-14 07:30:08	Justin	which is?
2013-02-14 07:30:24	@smeding	the resistance isn't an actual resistor it's just an intrinsic property of the battery
2013-02-14 07:31:34	@smeding	the voltage source changes as you discharge the battery though
2013-02-14 07:32:02	Justin	doesn't everything have an intrinsic resistance property?
2013-02-14 07:32:04	Justin	even wire itself?
2013-02-14 07:32:32	@smeding	i don't think superconductors do
2013-02-14 07:32:39	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-14 07:32:42	Justin	but those must be super expensive
2013-02-14 07:32:42	Justin	:V
2013-02-14 07:32:46	@smeding	well
2013-02-14 07:32:56	@smeding	they're just specific materials that you cool to very low temperatures
2013-02-14 07:33:01	Justin	ah
2013-02-14 07:33:04	Justin	so just impractical, I suppose
2013-02-14 07:33:09	@smeding	a lot of the time
2013-02-14 07:33:26	@smeding	we find new materials that do it sometimes though, so it's possible that we could find room-temperature superconductors
2013-02-14 07:33:36	Justin	then suddenly
2013-02-14 07:33:42	Justin	life improves
2013-02-14 07:33:48	@smeding	and they're already used in like
2013-02-14 07:33:48	@smeding	MRI magnets
2013-02-14 07:33:59	@smeding	and some power line systems too i think
2013-02-14 07:34:03	Justin	I see
2013-02-14 07:34:18	Justin	[23:31:27] <@smeding> the voltage source changes as you discharge the battery though
2013-02-14 07:34:21	Justin	why does it change?
2013-02-14 07:34:24	Justin	and what's a voltage source?
2013-02-14 07:34:27	Justin	isn't voltage a difference
2013-02-14 07:34:30	Justin	how can it have a source
2013-02-14 07:34:37	@smeding	it's just a name
2013-02-14 07:34:42	@smeding	a voltage source is a theoretical circuit element
2013-02-14 07:34:54	@smeding	that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals
2013-02-14 07:34:57	@smeding	no matter the current
2013-02-14 07:35:18	@smeding	every kind of circuit element has a specific relationship between voltage and current
2013-02-14 07:35:30	Justin	I think I'm learning way out of my scope here
2013-02-14 07:35:37	@smeding	who cares
2013-02-14 07:35:38	@smeding	learning is awesome
2013-02-14 07:35:43	Justin	yeah but too much jargon
2013-02-14 07:37:30	Justin	well my physics book
2013-02-14 07:37:39	Justin	is relating voltage, resistance, and current together
2013-02-14 07:37:42	Justin	how do they go together?
2013-02-14 07:37:47	@smeding	ohm's law
2013-02-14 07:37:54	@smeding	but that only holds for resistances
2013-02-14 07:37:59	@smeding	you can't use that on a voltage source or a diode
2013-02-14 07:38:00	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-14 07:38:12	@smeding	a lot of people do make that mistake
2013-02-14 07:38:19	Justin	so what I'm learning in my school
2013-02-14 07:38:19	@smeding	at first, when getting into electrical engineering
2013-02-14 07:38:24	Justin	is only a very narrow scope in electricity?
2013-02-14 07:38:41	@smeding	eh, i reckon they just teach it wrong
2013-02-14 07:39:00	@smeding	implying that resistance is some special thing with broad application
2013-02-14 07:39:09	Justin	yeah
2013-02-14 07:39:10	@smeding	when it's just a model for how a resistor works
2013-02-14 07:39:13	Justin	that's the impression I'm getting
2013-02-14 07:39:29	@smeding	well, it has broad application, but it's far from the whole story
2013-02-14 07:39:37	Justin	so, you mean
2013-02-14 07:39:38	@smeding	there are plenty of circuit elements that do not follow ohm's law
2013-02-14 07:39:41	Justin	the ohm isn't useful in everything?
2013-02-14 07:39:44	Justin	the ohm unit
2013-02-14 07:39:46	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 07:39:53	Justin	I see
2013-02-14 07:39:58	Justin	I guess that's where I went wrong
2013-02-14 07:40:01	@smeding	like if you have a diode
2013-02-14 07:40:03	Justin	I was under the impression that even GPUs have an ohm
2013-02-14 07:40:07	Justin	do GPUs have an ohm?
2013-02-14 07:40:14	@smeding	you mean a resistance
2013-02-14 07:40:14	Justin	what's a GPU, is it a diode or what
2013-02-14 07:40:16	@smeding	but no, they don't
2013-02-14 07:40:22	@smeding	a GPU is made up of a lot of parts
2013-02-14 07:40:26	Justin	I mean, ohm units, or resistance, yes
2013-02-14 07:40:31	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 07:40:36	@smeding	transistors, mostly, which complicates things because they have three terminals
2013-02-14 07:40:40	Justin	so for rheostats, ohm's law works, right?
2013-02-14 07:40:44	@smeding	yeah
2013-02-14 07:40:48	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 07:40:59	Justin	so in ohm's law, how does voltage relate here
2013-02-14 07:41:07	@smeding	i don't know by heart what the voltage/current relation for a GPU looks like
2013-02-14 07:41:24	@smeding	but i'd imagine it'd be like
2013-02-14 07:41:34	@smeding	under a certain voltage you don't draw a lot of current
2013-02-14 07:41:48	@smeding	as you increase the voltage across it, suddenly it hits a point where it turns 'on' and starts drawing current
2013-02-14 07:42:21	@smeding	then current rises as voltage rises for a bit, until finally current starts increasing exponentially with voltage as the current starts destroying the thing
2013-02-14 07:42:25	Justin	wait how do you increase the voltage
2013-02-14 07:42:31	Justin	wait wait
2013-02-14 07:42:31	Justin	wait
2013-02-14 07:42:34	@smeding	magic
2013-02-14 07:42:45	Justin	I remember doing an experiment on these types of setup
2013-02-14 07:42:52	Justin	I was the only group that had the correct readings
2013-02-14 07:42:52	@smeding	all you need to know is you can have a power supply that you can adjust, that pretty much behaves like a voltage source
2013-02-14 07:43:03	@smeding	so voltage is the same no matter the current
2013-02-14 07:43:09	@smeding	but you can change the voltage with a knob
2013-02-14 07:43:11	Justin	Mainly because there was only one other group that did it and got it wrong
2013-02-14 07:43:15	Justin	and everyone else just copied my readings
2013-02-14 07:43:16	Justin	anyway
2013-02-14 07:43:28	Justin	We had a power supply
2013-02-14 07:43:32	@smeding	how it manages to maintain a steady voltage that can vary isn't entirely relevant
2013-02-14 07:43:50	Justin	where it runs through an ammeter, a piece of wire, and a variable resistor at the end
2013-02-14 07:43:53	Justin	before returning back to the power supply
2013-02-14 07:44:13	@smeding	anyway this is the relationship between voltage over and current through a diode https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diode-IV-Curve.svg

2013-02-14 07:44:23	@smeding	afk for a bit though
2013-02-14 07:44:23	Justin	although may I ask what's the point of a rheostat at the end of the circuit?
2013-02-14 07:44:26	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 07:44:32	@smeding	what do you mean what's the point
2013-02-14 07:44:38	Justin	I mean
2013-02-14 07:44:40	Justin	what does it change
2013-02-14 07:44:50	Justin	if the rheostat was missing
2013-02-14 07:44:51	@smeding	the relationship between voltage and current between those two points
2013-02-14 07:44:53	Justin	or if it was there
2013-02-14 07:45:03	Justin	yeah but I didn't need to put a voltmeter where the rheostat was
2013-02-14 07:45:09	Justin	so there was no reading
2013-02-14 07:45:10	Justin	???
2013-02-14 07:45:19	Justin	do you want a picture of the diagram?
2013-02-14 07:45:23	@smeding	changes don't just occur at that point
2013-02-14 07:45:26	@smeding	it's all interdependent
2013-02-14 07:45:36	Justin	anyway uh
2013-02-14 07:45:41	Justin	in my data I recordered
2013-02-14 07:45:48	@smeding	if you change the relationship there, it can change in other places too
2013-02-14 07:45:50	@smeding	and will
2013-02-14 07:45:56	Justin	cool
2013-02-14 07:46:00	Justin	also uh
2013-02-14 07:46:33	Justin	if you increase the length of the wire, the voltage for the points between the wire increases, but current decreases
2013-02-14 07:46:37	Justin	resistance naturally increases, though
2013-02-14 07:47:10	Justin	so I suppose this is demonstrating ohm's law or something?
2013-02-14 07:47:23	Justin	more length = more resistance = more voltage = less current
2013-02-14 07:48:06	@smeding	more resistance doesn't imply more voltage or less current necessarily
2013-02-14 07:48:39	@smeding	if you hook it up to a voltage source you get the same voltage (the voltage source keeps it constant no matter the current) and less current
2013-02-14 07:48:59	Justin	well actually
2013-02-14 07:49:09	Justin	I calculated the resistance from my readings on the current and the voltage
2013-02-14 07:49:42	@smeding	anyway afk
2013-02-14 07:49:44	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 07:49:47	Justin	I'll ask more questions later

2013-02-14 07:57:45	Justin	it was a bad attempt to mix "far right" and "right wing" together

2013-02-14 07:57:53	@smeding	which one is supposed to be far right
2013-02-14 07:57:59	Justin	isn't fascism a far right policy?
2013-02-14 07:58:09	plutoniumape	the guy that looks like chaplin
2013-02-14 07:58:10	Justin	I remember dictionaries saying that it is
2013-02-14 07:58:33	plutoniumape	national socialism, still
2013-02-14 07:58:46	@smeding	" Fascists have commonly opposed having a firm association with any section of the left-right spectrum, considering it inadequate to describe their beliefs,[17][18] though fascism's goal to promote the rule of people deemed innately superior while seeking to purge society of people deemed innately inferior is identified as a prominent far-right theme."
2013-02-14 07:58:56	Justin	also didn't you say you were going to AFK
2013-02-14 07:58:59	Justin	I still have questions, you know

2013-02-14 08:00:14	Justin	what is a voltage source, in this case
2013-02-14 08:00:21	@smeding	like i said

2013-02-14 08:01:17	@smeding	not exactly, but you can get close enough that it doesn't matter

2013-02-14 08:01:27	@smeding	a lab power supply acts like a good voltage source
2013-02-14 08:01:32	Justin	okay
2013-02-14 08:01:41	Justin	so the power supply I'm using is a voltage source, I suppose
2013-02-14 08:01:49	@smeding	in 99% of cases, yes
2013-02-14 08:01:55	@smeding	a power outlet is a voltage source
2013-02-14 08:01:56	@smeding	too
2013-02-14 08:02:00	@smeding	but it's AC which complicates things
2013-02-14 08:02:10	Justin	so "if you hook it up"

2013-02-14 08:02:56	@smeding	(a wire can be described as a resistance, so can a rheostat)
2013-02-14 08:03:28	@smeding	more resistance, and the voltage is constant because it's a voltage source, so the current changes

2013-02-14 08:04:11	Justin	yeah in this case I have a rheostat and a wire in this circuit
2013-02-14 08:04:20	Justin	I'm measuring the voltage of the points between the wire though
2013-02-14 08:04:38	Justin	but how can you hook up a resistor to a voltage source directly
2013-02-14 08:05:54	@smeding	what does 'the points between the wire' mean
2013-02-14 08:06:31	@smeding	and why wouldn't you be able to hook up a resistor to a voltage source directly
2013-02-14 08:09:46	Justin	uh
2013-02-14 08:10:02	Justin	how do you hook it up though
2013-02-14 08:10:05	Justin	like
2013-02-14 08:10:23	Justin	in my case, the current flows from the power source through an ammteter and then through the wire
2013-02-14 08:10:26	Justin	which is a resistor
2013-02-14 08:10:55	Justin	and a voltmeter takes a reading on the voltage on the points of the circuit before it passes the wire and after it passes through the wire

2013-02-14 08:12:29	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 08:12:34	@smeding	so you measured the voltage across the wire

2013-02-14 08:12:58	Justin	the current decreases and the voltage increases
2013-02-14 08:13:02	Justin	and hence the resistance increases
2013-02-14 08:14:29	@smeding	yes
2013-02-14 08:15:31	Justin	okay so
2013-02-14 08:15:39	Justin	how does it change is I connect the wire directly to the power supply

2013-02-14 08:17:30	@smeding	Justin: the voltage doesn't change because there's nothing else for it to drop voltage over

2013-02-14 08:35:14	@smeding	the current is the same everywhere
2013-02-14 08:35:16	@smeding	current is water flow
2013-02-14 08:35:24	@smeding	there's a voltage gradient but that's not what he asked, and not even relevant here
2013-02-14 08:35:42	@smeding	Justin: the current is lower because it's harder for charge carriers to 'flow'
2013-02-14 08:36:30	@smeding	flow costs more energy, so if there's the same amount of potential energy (voltage) there's less flow

2013-02-14 08:42:20	@smeding	your power supply
2013-02-14 08:42:30	@smeding	still puts out the same voltage
2013-02-14 08:44:19	Justin	oh we're in the scenario where the voltage stays the same, right?
2013-02-14 08:44:28	Justin	if you hook up the resistor to the power supply directly?

2013-02-14 08:45:02	Justin	wait
2013-02-14 08:45:10	Justin	isn't the power supply supposed to put out the same current?
2013-02-14 08:45:11	Justin	???
2013-02-14 08:45:20	@smeding	usually power supplies are constant voltage
2013-02-14 08:45:32	@smeding	a wall outlet has a constant 230V AC across it
2013-02-14 08:45:43	Justin	why would the potential difference be constant?
2013-02-14 08:45:55	@smeding	because the power supply contains circuitry that keeps it constant
2013-02-14 08:46:04	@smeding	and if you don't exceed its ratings, it will succeed
2013-02-14 08:46:34	@smeding	the power grid contains control systems to achieve this as well
2013-02-14 08:47:00	@smeding	otherwise if you drew more power, the increased current would mean an increased voltage drop across the wires that carry the electricity to you
2013-02-14 08:47:17	@smeding	but it compensates
2013-02-14 08:50:33	Justin	?
2013-02-14 08:51:37	@smeding	what i'm trying to say is
2013-02-14 08:51:45	@smeding	it's an active thing that keeps the potential difference constant
2013-02-14 08:51:49	@smeding	and you need not concern yourself with how
2013-02-14 08:52:46	Justin	"voltage drop"

2013-02-14 08:58:22	@smeding	if you put voltage on the end of two wires
2013-02-14 08:58:30	@smeding	you are able to measure the same voltage on the other end of the wires
2013-02-14 08:58:57	@smeding	if you start drawing a current, voltage will drop over the wire, so the voltage over the end you're not putting the voltage on will drop

2013-02-14 10:01:58	RPharazon	Heh
2013-02-14 10:02:27	RPharazon	I just remembered when my family and I went to an all-inclusive seaside resort in Mexico last year
2013-02-14 10:02:34	RPharazon	Drinks and food and services free and whatnot
2013-02-14 10:02:43	RPharazon	And we had been in Mexico for two weeks
2013-02-14 10:02:54	RPharazon	And we're walking back to our room after dinner and some drinks
2013-02-14 10:03:07	RPharazon	And my dad is comfortably tipsy
2013-02-14 10:03:24	RPharazon	And he just starts talking about how his poops have been soft recently with the resort food
2013-02-14 10:03:41	RPharazon	And meanwhile we're blocking one of the hotel staff from walking past us
2013-02-14 10:03:56	RPharazon	And we're trying to get dad off to the side to let the nice staff past
2013-02-14 10:04:10	RPharazon	And he's still just talking about the qualities of the hotel food on poops
2013-02-14 10:04:23	RPharazon	So the hotel worker manages to get past and we can see him trying not to laugh like hell
2013-02-14 10:04:34	RPharazon	And he gets like 10m ahead of us and he begins to audibly giggle
2013-02-14 10:04:42	RPharazon	And we're all just laughing
2013-02-14 10:04:44	RPharazon	Good times

2013-02-14 10:07:52	Kidiri	And then pooped his pants with one of those soft hotel poops?

2013-02-14 13:11:52	Sabreman	or throwing them down your pipe so they end up contaminating you pool, spaw, a nd drinking water with their blood.
2013-02-14 13:11:53	@smeding	probably not
2013-02-14 13:12:12	Sabreman	and you cant get them out cuase they're ontop of a grate inside a tube filled with river watter
2013-02-14 13:12:15	Kidiri	Wait until it freezes.

2013-02-14 14:04:57	namad7	i dunno if it's an exploit
2013-02-14 14:05:02	namad7	the water flows through the cracks and is slowed
2013-02-14 14:05:09	namad7	because a diagonal isn't that wide?
2013-02-14 14:05:19	namad7	a full one tile opening is big enough for the water to gush through full force?
2013-02-14 14:05:54	Soadreqm	"The cracks"? That hole is wide enough for a dwarf to walk through. :P
2013-02-14 14:05:54	namad7	although there should prolly be a tile that's just like a wall but has a small hole in it for water which removes presserization and replaces the diagonal mechanic entirely?
2013-02-14 14:06:07	Soadreqm	Also, pressure does not work that way.
2013-02-14 14:06:20	namad7	well it does in df!
2013-02-14 14:06:25	sandbox	diagonals used to block all movement
2013-02-14 14:06:39	Soadreqm	Making the hole smaller makes the water rush through slower, but it'll still rise to the same level on the other side.
2013-02-14 14:07:00	Soadreqm	Pumps sound reasonable, though.
2013-02-14 14:07:52	Soadreqm	Well, not SCREW pumps specifically, but a mechanised device for making water pass through in reasonably sized chunks.
2013-02-14 14:08:03	Soadreqm	I imagine it as a miniature floodgate array.
2013-02-14 14:10:08	Kidiri	Your argument is invalid, namad7.
2013-02-14 14:10:21	Kidiri	Ever heard of communicating vessels?
2013-02-14 14:10:53	sandbox	this lead to a huge and pointless argument before
2013-02-14 14:11:34	Kidiri	But I think we can all agree on one point.
2013-02-14 14:11:41	Kidiri	DF Is Coded Dumb.
2013-02-14 14:12:57	sandbox	I think they should have something like the Romans had http://www.ancienttechnologycentre.co.uk/romanwaterlifting.html
2013-02-14 14:14:16	sandbox	it's actually quite a bit of nifty tech and is more elaborate than it first appears

2013-02-14 14:14:35	Kidiri	A lot of shit the Romans made is.
2013-02-14 14:14:39	gargantuan	can i use minecarts to haul it
2013-02-14 14:14:41	Kidiri	Is it gargantuan?
2013-02-14 14:14:44	Kidiri	Yep.
2013-02-14 14:14:52	Kidiri	Same goes for magma, by the way.
2013-02-14 14:14:54	gargantuan	how do i set that up, i have 1 lake ages away
2013-02-14 14:15:14	Kidiri	Submerge it in 4/7 or higher water
2013-02-14 14:15:16	Kidiri	And it should fill itself up.
2013-02-14 14:15:34	gargantuan	ok so maybe room then a pump then some carts

2013-02-14 14:18:09	Kidiri	I'd suggest digging out a room at Z-1, put tracks and rollers and whatnot
2013-02-14 14:18:30	Kidiri	Actually, if you'v got a lake
2013-02-14 14:18:43	Kidiri	Why not just dig out a pipe?
2013-02-14 14:19:12	gargantuan	my understanding is that if you don't have enough water to fill the pipe you lose some to evaporation over time
2013-02-14 14:19:15	gargantuan	like 1 per square
2013-02-14 14:19:17	Soadreqm	gargantuan: Using minecarts to haul water is possible, but really inefficient.
2013-02-14 14:19:26	Soadreqm	It's easier to just make an aqueduct.
2013-02-14 14:19:48	gargantuan	we're talking like 20 squares of water at the other end of the 4x4 map
2013-02-14 14:20:10	gargantuan	maybe i should just dig down and find an underground lake
2013-02-14 14:20:12	Soadreqm	The water source is limited? Well, that might be a problem.
2013-02-14 14:20:23	gargantuan	not sure how to power the pump stack though
2013-02-14 14:20:29	Soadreqm	I'd probably just dig deeper, yeah.
2013-02-14 14:20:35	gargantuan	the surface has a lot of goblin crossbow men
2013-02-14 14:20:43	gargantuan	which i can't deal with

2013-02-14 14:20:55	Kidiri	Wait 'em out.
2013-02-14 14:20:58	Soadreqm	If you find an underground lake, you can just dig wells down to it
2013-02-14 14:21:02	Soadreqm	No need to lift it up.
2013-02-14 14:21:04	gargantuan	ended p having 2 huge corpse rooms like a concentration camp :\
2013-02-14 14:21:09	gargantuan	can't build graves fast enough

2013-02-14 14:21:15	gargantuan	it's been a fucking rough fort
2013-02-14 14:21:20	Soadreqm	Unless you're building elaborate waterworks for something that isn't drinking.
2013-02-14 14:21:31	gargantuan	yeah good point about the well
2013-02-14 14:21:42	gargantuan	i want to have 4 wells in my meeting hall
2013-02-14 14:21:44	gargantuan	so that might work
2013-02-14 14:22:04	gargantuan	assume that some creature from the deep can come up the well shafts
2013-02-14 14:22:26	Soadreqm	Things that can fly can fly up wells.
2013-02-14 14:22:26	gargantuan	so i guess i should look at getting my army sorted, they are basically all a mess since they lost so many buddys
2013-02-14 14:22:42	Kidiri	Flying things might get through
2013-02-14 14:22:47	Kidiri	But that's what grates are for.
2013-02-14 14:22:48	sandbox	I wonder if Toady has any plans for more advanced plumbing using pipes and things
2013-02-14 14:22:50	Soadreqm	It doesn't come up THAT often, and you can defend against it, but yes, it is a thing.
2013-02-14 14:22:51	Kidiri	Or bars.
2013-02-14 14:22:54	gargantuan	if i put a barracks in the well shaft a few below the meeting hall it should path into the barracks before going to the hall right
2013-02-14 14:23:23	Soadreqm	sandbox: I'm pretty sure he has plans.
2013-02-14 14:23:40	Soadreqm	I think pipes were featured in the old dev goals.
2013-02-14 14:23:49	gargantuan	so are we in accord, wells and a barracks?
2013-02-14 14:24:05	gargantuan	also will dwarves take from wells and carry to fill a pond?
2013-02-14 14:24:06	Soadreqm	gargantuan: To be safe, you can build a tower under the well.
2013-02-14 14:24:15	Soadreqm	And put grates or fortifications under the water.
2013-02-14 14:24:28	Soadreqm	So that there are no openings that nasties can crawl through.

2013-02-14 19:26:24	Zackariah	Can goblins die of thirst or hunter
2013-02-14 19:26:57	TWA	yes, a goblin can die of HUNTER

2013-02-14 19:31:21	TWA	haha, I know, I was playing with you, but they can die from hunters, haha. Not sure about thirst/hunger though. I assume so?

2013-02-14 19:33:12	TWA	Does a channeled area without slopes function the same was as a wall, but inversed?
2013-02-14 19:33:27	AfterShave	Well, yes
2013-02-14 19:33:33	AfterShave	Except fliers can get across
2013-02-14 19:34:02	TWA	right, same with a wall though, right? Cool, this will work for me for now then. thanks
2013-02-14 19:34:25	AfterShave	A wall can be extended to heaven
2013-02-14 19:34:29	AfterShave	Or just, given a roof :P
2013-02-14 19:35:01	TWA	Right, I mean, I will build a wall in the place of this. But for now, I need it across a large area, and quickly, so channeling it is
2013-02-14 19:35:05	TWA	and then the wall slowly...
2013-02-14 19:36:06	TWA	How many z-levels can a crossbow weapon trap shoot across?
2013-02-14 19:36:49	AfterShave	I thought they only shot on the tile they're at
2013-02-14 19:37:05	AfterShave	But, now that I think of it, I have rarely used crossbows for traps
2013-02-14 19:37:12	AfterShave	I usually get spiked balls
2013-02-14 19:37:43	TWA	do they only shoot in their tile? I don't know..if so I wasted a lot of crossbows just now. haha
2013-02-14 19:42:06	TWA	So I have my metal armor to be weapon of choice, but some marksdwarfs still choose a spear/melee/etc
2013-02-14 19:42:13	TWA	even though I have crossbows available
2013-02-14 19:42:34	TWA	is there a way to fix that?
2013-02-14 19:42:38	AfterShave	Metal armor is your weapon of choice?
2013-02-14 19:42:51	AfterShave	:P
2013-02-14 19:43:07	TWA	hahaha, no metal armor, as the armor set, but weapon is "weapon of choice"
2013-02-14 19:43:32	AfterShave	Then it's what they prefer
2013-02-14 19:43:36	AfterShave	Not what you want them to have
2013-02-14 19:43:46	AfterShave	Change their weapon of choice to be crossbows

2013-02-14 19:46:42	AfterShave	Sounds a bit, much
2013-02-14 19:46:52	Spekkio	Yeah
2013-02-14 19:47:40	Spekkio	frankly I think I'd rather play oblivion except that I'm not sure how to fix the levelling bullshit

2013-02-14 19:58:33	gargantuan	i've been furiously training 10 dwarves in marksmanship and i'd ideally like to lure the goblins somewhere my archers can have a crack at them
2013-02-14 19:58:39	gargantuan	probably build a hospital next to it too

2013-02-14 19:59:30	AfterShave	Then close the gates and shoot
2013-02-14 19:59:49	TWA	fortifications
2013-02-14 19:59:57	gargantuan	so they are z-1? i was thinking fortifications
2013-02-14 20:00:07	AfterShave	Yes, -1 z
2013-02-14 20:00:21	gargantuan	do they get any penalty for shooting at fortifications or upward?
2013-02-14 20:00:22	AfterShave	But it's all underground so that you just open up a hole and run back in
2013-02-14 20:00:33	AfterShave	If they are farther away than 1 square, yes
2013-02-14 20:00:38	AfterShave	At some point it barely matters though

2013-02-14 20:02:26	gargantuan	what is the probability of a cage trap working
2013-02-14 20:02:46	gargantuan	i notice snatchers seem to bypass traps pretty easily
2013-02-14 20:02:58	TWA	on goblins? about 100%
2013-02-14 20:03:06	AfterShave	Yeah, 100%
2013-02-14 20:03:17	TWA	even dragons, can be captured with wooden cages

2013-02-14 20:04:01	TWA	i find it tough to full that off though, as they will tend to burn the cage while its still in the trap

2013-02-15 01:38:47	Spekkio	Damn. Consulted map in area I assumed was safe-ish, ambushed by spider, panicked and frost-bolted my whole party, killed by spider
2013-02-15 01:43:07	Spekkio	Regarding the Tesla Model S thing with the new york times reporter giving it a bad review... some CNN reporters repeated the experiment.

2013-02-15 02:07:42	Spekkio	Ohhhh. "the meteorite was intercepted by an air defense unit at the Urzhumka settlement near Chelyabinsk. A missile salvo blew the meteorite to pieces at an altitude of 20 kilometers, local newspaper Znak reports quoting a source in the military."

2013-02-15 04:16:11	Essence13	yeah probably.
2013-02-15 04:18:07	Essence13	also, I'm confused by the "staggered fortifications and walls" for training pits suggested in the mass pitting page of the wiki.  if I'm reading it right, it calls for 2 fortifications in a diagonal.  but won't that mess up non-elite xbows? or do they get the training xp anyway?
2013-02-15 04:18:39	Soadreqm	I'm pretty sure crossbowdwarves get XP per shot, not per hit.
2013-02-15 04:19:41	nuthulu	That would make sense
2013-02-15 04:19:57	nuthulu	Since training dwarves with targets means technically nothing is really getting hit

2013-02-15 04:25:15	Essence13	There isn't necessarily a "job" when attacking something. though I really don't know.

2013-02-15 04:29:25	nuthulu	True, you could always try having a squad of dwarves with no crossbow skill/very little to attack something rather harmless and see if they gain any xp

2013-02-15 05:02:15	Spekkio	and you turn it into a sandwich that you can fit into your mouth

2013-02-15 05:57:10	nuthulu	It can spend all day every day running a political campaign
2013-02-15 05:57:12	gargantuan	i locked it in a room with forbidden doors
2013-02-15 05:57:15	gargantuan	and some how it got out
2013-02-15 05:57:20	gargantuan	it was my manager
2013-02-15 05:57:32	nuthulu	So it probably has some decent social skills

2013-02-15 06:03:58	nuthulu	I don't think they have to eat in werecreature mode
2013-02-15 06:04:06	nuthulu	But in normal mode i'm not sure
2013-02-15 06:04:26	Soadreqm	Well, normal mode only lasts a month at a time.
2013-02-15 06:04:45	Soadreqm	If transforming resets their food clock or something, they won't have to eat unless they're adventurers.

2013-02-15 06:06:37	gargantuan	i set them up a well
2013-02-15 06:06:42	nuthulu	See the problem is that creating a werecreature is tricky
2013-02-15 06:06:43	gargantuan	not sure how to get it to go down
2013-02-15 06:06:54	Soadreqm	Fun fact: While my expedition leader is in antelope mode, I don't have the ability to assign nobles.
2013-02-15 06:06:58	nuthulu	Since most creatures in were form will just outright kill a dwarf
2013-02-15 06:06:59	gargantuan	i think locking it between two doors and ropping it a bunch of z levels
2013-02-15 06:07:27	Soadreqm	nuthulu: Yeah, I got really "lucky".

2013-02-15 09:20:28	sandbox	the last bugfixing session was really productive
2013-02-15 09:20:57	RPharazon|NB	For example, a bug that can corrupt your saves, or corrupt the game, or makes your dwarves melt in water, or that prevents any caravans from showing up
2013-02-15 09:21:07	Kidiri	I remember a time when there would be a new release every 2 or 3 months.
2013-02-15 09:21:20	Kidiri	Oooh, remember the acid rain bug?

2013-02-15 09:27:30	Soadreqm	Toady recently mentioned in his dev log that he chose NOT to include the whole thief adventurer role in this release, even though he's been skirting it for a while.
2013-02-15 09:27:49	Soadreqm	Probably several months of delay avoided!
2013-02-15 09:27:51	sandbox	hopefully after this next release it won't be another year

2013-02-15 10:23:16	sandbox	he actually finished DF 10 years ago but he's giving it out to us in little chunks
2013-02-15 10:23:58	Kidiri	Or will he have finished it 5 years from now ago?
2013-02-15 10:24:22	Trifase	In another planet
2013-02-15 10:26:57	Kidiri	The 29/10/2007 update took 284 days, the 14/07/2008 update 141 days, the 01/04/2010 update a whopping 570 days and the 14/02/2012 update 323 days.
2013-02-15 10:28:44	AfterShave	How far are we into this cycle?
2013-02-15 10:28:50	Soadreqm	Kidiri: So DF, despite the repeated preposterously long slogs, manages to average monthly releases?
2013-02-15 10:28:59	Soadreqm	I would have guessed several times that.
2013-02-15 10:29:07	Kidiri	Well, to be honest
2013-02-15 10:29:07	Soadreqm	That's actually pretty reasonable. :/
2013-02-15 10:29:34	Kidiri	The first 15 updates were mostly within a week.
2013-02-15 10:29:43	Kidiri	No, 14
2013-02-15 10:29:49	Kidiri	There was the relese

2013-02-15 10:30:17	Soadreqm	Must have been a lot of relatively simple bugs.
2013-02-15 10:30:26	AfterShave	Imagine if he got out a bloat bi-daily
2013-02-15 10:30:27	Soadreqm	Now we just have the complex bugs left.

2013-02-15 10:32:57	RPharazon|NB	iGobbo
2013-02-15 10:33:20	Soadreqm	Ah, so each of the first 14 updates was (more or less) within a week of the one preceding it.
2013-02-15 10:33:31	Soadreqm	That's quite a few less than 14 updates/week.
2013-02-15 10:33:32	Soadreqm	Still fast.
2013-02-15 10:33:45	Kidiri	Watch out or Steve Jobs will rise from the grave and sue you, RPharazon.

2013-02-15 10:45:44	Justin	basically
2013-02-15 10:45:44	Soadreqm	He mentioned that climbing the tower can mess you up.
2013-02-15 10:45:51	RPharazon|NB	Justin, to the public, there is no "harmless radiation"
2013-02-15 10:46:00	Justin	but I studied physics

2013-02-15 10:46:59	Justin	so I suppose phones emit relatively little radiatoin?
2013-02-15 10:47:24	Justin	because I remember reading the newspaper and this guy was pushing to selling his product
2013-02-15 10:47:26	BW	look, radiation means about as much as 'chemicals' does
2013-02-15 10:47:28	Kidiri	Or go on a mission outside of the ozon-layer, BW.
2013-02-15 10:47:28	Soadreqm	Phones emit no ionising radiation.
2013-02-15 10:47:29	Justin	which is basically headphones
2013-02-15 10:47:30	Kidiri	BAM
2013-02-15 10:47:33	Justin	or something
2013-02-15 10:47:35	Soadreqm	They emit some radio waves.
2013-02-15 10:47:39	sandbox	do they allow you to use phones in hospitals?
2013-02-15 10:47:42	Kidiri	UV-radiatioooon
2013-02-15 10:47:42	Soadreqm	Also visible light, from the screen.
2013-02-15 10:47:46	Justin	so basically you can talk with your head a meter away from your phone
2013-02-15 10:47:50	Soadreqm	Some phones even have flashlights.
2013-02-15 10:47:50	BW	sandbox: depends on the hospital
2013-02-15 10:47:59	BW	but that's generally an interference concern
2013-02-15 10:48:05	Soadreqm	So you can get a LOT of radiation!
2013-02-15 10:48:16	sandbox	I thought all that was disproven

2013-02-15 10:48:36	Justin	no this guy was like

2013-02-15 10:48:46	BW	sandbox: well, there's also audio interference ;P
2013-02-15 10:48:49	Justin	and he's talking on like, headphones or something
2013-02-15 10:48:58	Justin	and they're selling a product that caters /just/ for that!
2013-02-15 10:49:04	Justin	Better to be safe than sorry!
2013-02-15 10:49:10	sandbox	keeping your phone near your genitals isn't perhaps the best idea
2013-02-15 10:49:10	BW	so….a wireles headset?
2013-02-15 10:49:18	Justin	no a wired one
2013-02-15 10:49:32	Soadreqm	A wireless headset would require EVEN MORE radiation.
2013-02-15 10:49:34	Soadreqm	Silly.
2013-02-15 10:49:36	BW	oh right, wireless would be a b....yes

2013-02-15 10:49:56	Justin	oh no
2013-02-15 10:50:03	Kidiri	But in a wired headset, you get electrons moving around, Justin.
2013-02-15 10:50:03	sandbox	Kidiri: disposable ones?
2013-02-15 10:50:15	BW	listen, if you're worried about wireless anything fucking you up, i means i have to try not to laugh when you bring it up

2013-02-15 18:19:28	Spekkio	What... the fuck, legend of grimrock
2013-02-15 18:19:59	Spekkio	I thought I just cleared a closed region... then suddenly spiders
2013-02-15 18:20:00	Spekkio	three of them
2013-02-15 18:20:07	Spekkio	attacking from two sides.
2013-02-15 18:20:38	AfterShave	And then you died?
2013-02-15 18:23:21	Spekkio	Yes
2013-02-15 18:23:28	Spekkio	I killed two of them but by then it was too late
2013-02-15 18:23:43	Spekkio	At least this time I didn't accidentally Ice Spike my own party
2013-02-15 18:23:48	AfterShave	Not having played Grimrock myself, is there ressurection?
2013-02-15 18:23:52	Spekkio	I have no idea
2013-02-15 18:24:05	AfterShave	I only really know you're trying to escape
2013-02-15 18:24:10	Spekkio	I'm unspoiled at this point
2013-02-15 18:24:33	AfterShave	And that for whatever reason security gets better the further you get to the exit
2013-02-15 18:25:05	Spekkio	kinda annoying when a characters skill in a spell category goes up faster than I personally know spells that I can use to cast with it
2013-02-15 18:25:32	Spekkio	because it's got this sorta "rune-based" magic system. There's 9 runes. The combination of them that you select refers to a particular spell
2013-02-15 18:25:42	Spekkio	well, most often it's no spell at all of course
2013-02-15 18:25:57	Spekkio	otherwise there would be 2^9-1 possible spells.
2013-02-15 18:26:18	AfterShave	What if I really wanted uuh, 511(?) spells
2013-02-15 18:26:36	Spekkio	(assuming that "no runes selected" is not a valid spell)

2013-02-15 18:27:22	Spekkio	And of course there is no rhyme or reason behind the relationship between the runes and the spell. For example, referring to the low-level spells that I actually know about...
2013-02-15 18:27:43	AfterShave	How do you find out new combinations in the game?
2013-02-15 18:27:54	AfterShave	MOstly that is
2013-02-15 18:28:26	Spekkio	You can either experiment, burning up your energy, or find them written on scrolls... the locations and content of which appear to be hardcoded
2013-02-15 18:29:01	 *	Spekkio thinks he might experiment/savescum
2013-02-15 18:29:18	Spekkio	Anyway about "spell logic"
2013-02-15 18:29:32	Spekkio	rune G by itself is "poison cloud", the lowest-level earth spell
2013-02-15 18:29:41	AfterShave	No logic at all?
2013-02-15 18:29:45	Spekkio	but rune G + rune I is "ice shards".
2013-02-15 18:30:40	Spekkio	so yeah at this point I have no hope of a particular rune actually referring to any singular concept
2013-02-15 18:31:29	AfterShave	I see
2013-02-15 18:33:07	AfterShave	Has anyone here played Eclipse Phase? It has a very interesting setting

2013-02-15 18:47:24	Spekkio	And I found that there does actually appear to be a little logic behind the spell runes. Not much, though.
2013-02-15 18:47:36	Spekkio	(omg spoilerth)
2013-02-15 18:48:12	AfterShave	Don't worry, I would have done the same thing :P
2013-02-15 18:50:14	Spekkio	Now I just need to figure out how to approach this... spider warren. I don't want to be ambushed after doing all the exploring again.

2013-02-15 18:58:16	Spekkio	But frankly I prefer seeing.

2013-02-15 19:01:51	Spekkio	But right now I feel like I'm not getting proper use out of the rogue and I need a better (armour-using) tank than the monk

2013-02-15 19:10:51	Spekkio	The area I came from is definitely cleared out. But then I seem to cross this threshold as I press in and it releases spiders behind me
2013-02-15 19:11:21	Spekkio	I suspect that they try to path towards me (from the other side of a wall?) and walk into a teleportation area or something

2013-02-15 22:46:50	Justin	Yeah
2013-02-15 22:47:01	Justin	Also people probably wouldn't swear as much
2013-02-15 22:47:05	Justin	It's not edgy anymore
2013-02-15 22:47:06	gargantuan	it seems kind of backward to me

2013-02-15 22:50:20	gargantuan	but yeah i think concern over expletives is much the same poorly engineered culture as a lot of spirituality seems to feed offof
2013-02-15 22:50:35	Justin	aye
2013-02-15 22:50:47	Justin	Although slurs aren't the same as your average profanity though
2013-02-15 22:50:53	Justin	those things carry a lot more history with them
2013-02-15 22:51:10	Justin	and is discrimnative
2013-02-15 22:51:23	Justin	anyway some people have a terrible compulsion to avoid swear filters

2013-02-15 22:51:48	gargantuan	where as i notice people who get pissy about me saying faggot are often way more bigoted than me
2013-02-15 22:51:48	Justin	culture has a lot to play in the role
2013-02-15 22:52:01	Justin	why are they pissy though
2013-02-15 22:52:11	gargantuan	breaking the rules of decency maybe

2013-02-15 22:53:07	Justin	Every time~
2013-02-15 22:53:11	gargantuan	we're discussing the very thing you just did Anticheese
2013-02-15 22:53:14	gargantuan	not calling anyone names
2013-02-15 22:53:15	@Anticheese	Because I'm such a fucking cheerful guy.
2013-02-15 22:53:22	gargantuan	if anything you've just shown how silly people are
2013-02-15 22:53:41	@Anticheese	Because we try and keep some standards of behaviour here?
2013-02-15 22:53:48	gargantuan	...
2013-02-15 22:53:48	Justin	oh dear
2013-02-15 22:53:50	Justin	not this again
2013-02-15 22:53:58	gargantuan	Anticheese: sorry for upsetting you, lets drop the topic
2013-02-15 22:54:09	@Anticheese	I'm not upset. I'm just saying that this is a thing we do.
2013-02-15 22:54:11	Justin	let's go back to profanities :V
2013-02-15 22:54:18	Justin	Also I'm pretty sure Anticheese is a goon
2013-02-15 22:54:22	Justin	and goons frown on slurs

2013-02-15 22:54:53	Justin	I see
2013-02-15 22:55:56	Justin	even 8 year olds swear compulsively these days
2013-02-15 22:56:02	Justin	You'd think it's a puberty thing
2013-02-15 22:56:03	Justin	But nope
2013-02-15 22:56:38	@Anticheese	I've got neighbours that swear compulsively, but the mother at least doesn't do it so much around her kid anymore
2013-02-15 22:57:21	gargantuan	so what's wrong with swearing
2013-02-15 22:57:46	-->	GarthAlgar (~GarthAlga@NewNet-FC7B9BB8.dynamic.primacom.net) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-15 22:58:06	gargantuan	only thing i can think of is that because of teh cultural belief that it's inappropriate you don't want an innocent to pick it up (i.e. a young child) because of the stigma
2013-02-15 22:58:17	gargantuan	but that's so self referential it's ridiculous
2013-02-15 22:58:32	gargantuan	there is no real wrongness here
2013-02-15 22:58:46	gargantuan	maybe in prescientific minds
2013-02-15 22:58:47	Justin	gargantuan: There's nothing wrong with swearing actually
2013-02-15 22:58:51	Justin	it's the intent behind it that matters though
2013-02-15 22:58:51	Justin	:V
2013-02-15 22:59:01	gargantuan	right
2013-02-15 22:59:05	gargantuan	that's absolutely my position
2013-02-15 22:59:14	gargantuan	what is the motivation rather than the implementation
2013-02-15 22:59:20	Justin	But I find pottymouths annoying as I find anyone repeating a set of words over and over annoying
2013-02-15 22:59:35	Justin	"Do you chicken this better chicken get chicken this"
2013-02-15 22:59:35	gargantuan	right, that was what i was trying to say before with the 'nailed it' thing
2013-02-15 22:59:55	gargantuan	lack of vocabulary is only going to get worse i think
2013-02-15 23:00:07	gargantuan	i'm one of the few people i know who even reads avidly
2013-02-15 23:01:04	gargantuan	the internets gift of tiny fragmented attention spans and rapid dissemination of fashionable language is just going to result in some kind of terrible flock of parrots
2013-02-15 23:01:11	Justin	also swear words are meant to be used
2013-02-15 23:01:17	Justin	they wouldn't be there if it wasn't meant to be used anyway
2013-02-15 23:01:23	gargantuan	Anticheese hasn't added anything yet
2013-02-15 23:01:29	Justin	I don't think he will
2013-02-15 23:01:45	Justin	idk man but I can't stand to read a novel
2013-02-15 23:01:51	Justin	I can read novellas though
2013-02-15 23:01:54	Justin	but novels are just too draggy
2013-02-15 23:02:02	gargantuan	heh
2013-02-15 23:02:09	@Anticheese	I'm just not a fan of four-year-olds having "fucking cunts!" as their main vocab.
2013-02-15 23:02:33	gargantuan	right but that's no explanation as to what is going on
2013-02-15 23:02:43	Justin	Anticheese: Me too
2013-02-15 23:02:54	gargantuan	that's what i was describing above as the innocent problem
2013-02-15 23:03:05	gargantuan	which is not a strong argument though we all understand it
2013-02-15 23:03:11	Noizhead	profanity makes talking fun
2013-02-15 23:03:17	Justin	Anyway I never encountered any young children swearing compulsively until recently
2013-02-15 23:03:27	Justin	I wonder what's up with that
2013-02-15 23:03:29	gargantuan	it perpetuates teh stupidity of there even being profanity as a concept
2013-02-15 23:04:11	Justin	Although we need to see
2013-02-15 23:04:25	Justin	Some words do carry unfortunate meanings
2013-02-15 23:04:31	Justin	sentences, rather
2013-02-15 23:04:46	Justin	like 10 year olds saying "ill rape ur mom u fking cunt bitch"
2013-02-15 23:04:49	gargantuan	bbc constantly saying 'a previously unknown loophole' to define this facebook hacking breach is retarded
2013-02-15 23:04:59	gargantuan	as if they'd broadcast it was a known loophole
2013-02-15 23:05:13	@Anticheese	Definitely not fond of rape being used as an adjective in most contexts.
2013-02-15 23:05:20	Justin	Anticheese: Aye
2013-02-15 23:06:15	Justin	Also some people are perfectly fine with slurs and not profanities
2013-02-15 23:06:22	Justin	it absolutely boggles my mind

2013-02-15 23:08:27	gargantuan	my grandfathers neighbour used to say 'bugger' when she was cross, until he explained to her the close relationship to unnatural intercourse
2013-02-15 23:13:25	@Anticheese	Honestly? 'bugger' is pretty much just a more British 'damnit', and its silly to read too much into either ones outside of their common intent as an expletive. 'Rape' and 'fag/gay/whatever' are much more serious issues than old-timey references to anal sex and damnation.

2013-02-15 23:21:18	Justin	I suppose they are like those non-white idiots who support Nazi Germany
2013-02-15 23:21:22	gargantuan	yeah that whole overview is hilarious

2013-02-15 23:25:01	gargantuan	for what i've read there is some debate about wehther they came down via north america and across first or just down or both ways and merged
2013-02-15 23:25:08	gargantuan	shrug
2013-02-15 23:25:22	Justin	well technically native Americans were Asians

2013-02-15 23:26:28	Justin	Indeed
2013-02-15 23:27:52	gargantuan	any idea why it's asking 'Are you sure you want to embark here? This is your only warning!'
2013-02-15 23:28:04	gargantuan	proximity to something?
2013-02-15 23:28:12	gargantuan	or just a general confirm dialogue?

2013-02-16 01:39:26	Kidiri	It gives ridiculous amounts.
2013-02-16 01:39:38	Essence13	I don't know how much volume a unit of water is.  and appearently you can't fill a barrel of alcohol.
2013-02-16 01:40:06	Kidiri	IIRC, Toady once said a tile (for minecart purposes, but that's all we've got) is 2 by 2 by 3 meters
2013-02-16 01:40:28	Kidiri	So that's 12 cubic meters of water
2013-02-16 01:40:38	Kidiri	If it's filled 7/7
2013-02-16 01:40:41	Essence13	I have capacity for barrels, and therefore pots.  But I don't think capacity corelates to volume.
2013-02-16 01:43:23	Kidiri	Oh wait
2013-02-16 01:43:40	Kidiri	If you know the mass of an empty barrel/pot
2013-02-16 01:44:03	Kidiri	Divide it by the density of the material it's made of
2013-02-16 01:44:10	Kidiri	And add the capacity
2013-02-16 01:44:20	Kidiri	Then you should have the total volume.
2013-02-16 01:45:28	Justin	oh god
2013-02-16 01:45:30	Justin	it's Kidiri

2013-02-16 01:45:54	Kidiri	Solving world's problems with maths.
2013-02-16 01:46:09	Essence13	200cm*200cm*300cm=12,000,000cm^3.   That times 2/7= 3,428,571cm^3.  so a minecart holds 3.4mil cm^3 water, or 50,000cm^3 of stone.  doesn't corelate.
2013-02-16 01:47:29	Kidiri	Then fuck it, I don't know.
2013-02-16 01:48:18	Essence13	I just want to know how many barrels or pots fit in a minecart.  and doesn't have to be exact, just an accurate approx (not a guess).
2013-02-16 01:48:30	Trifase	It's Kidiri

2013-02-16 01:49:40	Justin	also there are a ton of suporters for the OUYA on YouTube
2013-02-16 01:49:47	Justin	on the YouTube video, that is
2013-02-16 01:50:03	Essence13	I know.  I don't have it set up and thought it would be easier just to look it up and do a little math. turns out I spent way more time that way, for nothing.
2013-02-16 01:50:09	Justin	Just waiting for the OUYA to crash and burn

2013-02-16 02:15:46	Soadreqm	Essence13: I'd guess it's ten.
2013-02-16 02:16:24	Soadreqm	Based on the assumption that volume is not actually tracked in a meaningful way.
2013-02-16 02:16:40	Soadreqm	And minecarts just hold an arbitrary number of objects.
2013-02-16 02:16:51	Soadreqm	Which might actually be FIVE, now that I think about it more.
2013-02-16 02:17:40	Essence13	Soadreqm: thanks.  but wild guesses are not what I'm after.  either calculations or actual observation.  I'll test it out soon.
2013-02-16 02:17:53	Essence13	it's not a set number for minecarts.
2013-02-16 02:18:11	Essence13	you can fit 5 stones but at least 8 logs for example
2013-02-16 02:18:44	Soadreqm	Really? That's pretty neat. I've only really used them for stones.
2013-02-16 02:19:23	Essence13	I have a quantum stockpile waiting for the track stop to be built right now. 10 logs waiting to get dumped from the cart.

2013-02-16 03:55:38	gargantuan	are monkeys (gray langurs) any use for war or defense
2013-02-16 03:55:49	gargantuan	i don't have enough dogs really to keep an eye out
2013-02-16 03:57:38	Soadreqm	You can place them in a pasture somewhere where you expect enemies to sneak in, and they'll detect them.
2013-02-16 03:57:50	Soadreqm	So they work as watchdogs.
2013-02-16 03:58:47	PhoebosLC	Chain them outside
2013-02-16 03:58:54	PhoebosLC	If someone sneaks in, they will spook them
2013-02-16 03:58:58	Soadreqm	Non-war animals tend to run away from combat, though, and I think gray langurs suck at fighting anyway, so don't expect them to actually defend your fort.
2013-02-16 03:59:05	PhoebosLC	Thats why you chain them
2013-02-16 03:59:28	PhoebosLC	And beside, there's a minuscle chance of them clawing their eyes out or whatever

2013-02-16 04:09:32	Soadreqm	gargantuan: build the cage somewhere, unassign the raven and the dwarves will release it.
2013-02-16 04:12:22	@Makrond	"Example: You're at a party, you're drinking, your friends are drinking, everyone is having a good time until someone starts making trouble and resists the efforts of you and your friends to resolve it peacefully. Basically this is a guy looking for a fight. Now, is it better to take him down with the absolute minimum amount of force possible, or to give him a beating him and his friends won't forget?
2013-02-16 04:12:23	@Makrond	I believe that you should always try to head off confrontations long before they happen, which leads to me believing that if you knock a guy out quick, the his mates are gonna come after you later, but if you beat him down, break his bones and smash his face open, then no one who witnesses it or the result will dare take you on."

2013-02-16 07:23:12	Justin	HOORAY
2013-02-16 07:23:14	AfterShave	Then find out 80% into the game there are things that don't care if you're invisible
2013-02-16 07:23:14	Justin	MORE FIREWORKS!
2013-02-16 07:23:18	AfterShave	And die, from being underleveled
2013-02-16 07:23:32	AfterShave	And that's how I beat Skyrim
2013-02-16 07:32:11	Spekkio	Invisibility requires Air Magic 19
2013-02-16 07:32:27	Spekkio	and right now I have... air magic 9
2013-02-16 07:33:12	Spekkio	anyway due to enemies having bad pathing and me having a long path behind for me to do a fighting retreat... I destroyed 5 spiders with little difficulty
2013-02-16 07:34:12	Spekkio	also even if I was invisible I'd still probably choose to kill everything because bloodshed
2013-02-16 07:34:19	Spekkio	thus no underleveling.
2013-02-16 07:35:07	AfterShave	To me that defeats the point of being invisible :P
2013-02-16 07:35:38	AfterShave	Going right through the enemy encampment is what makes invisibility so neat, at least to me
2013-02-16 07:37:47	Justin	so uh
2013-02-16 07:38:08	Justin	Those OUYA fanboys have never heard of the PC, have they?
2013-02-16 07:38:50	nuthulu	Okay i'll just ask this now
2013-02-16 07:38:51	PhoebosLC	I cant help but notice you're kinda obsessed with the thing
2013-02-16 07:38:56	nuthulu	Is OUYA the new steambox thing
2013-02-16 07:39:00	AfterShave	A PC isn't 99$ though
2013-02-16 07:39:03	nuthulu	Or something completely different
2013-02-16 07:39:07	AfterShave	Think how cheap a single ouya is compared to it
2013-02-16 07:39:14	PhoebosLC	nuthulu: It's an android box for 100 bux
2013-02-16 07:39:19	PhoebosLC	That can run android games
2013-02-16 07:39:23	PhoebosLC	You hook it up to your tv
2013-02-16 07:39:27	PhoebosLC	And play angry birds on it
2013-02-16 07:39:43	nuthulu	....Why?
2013-02-16 07:40:15	PhoebosLC	Because fuck you thats why
2013-02-16 07:40:20	PhoebosLC	Also it's kinda gennius
2013-02-16 07:40:26	PhoebosLC	They have a knack for marketing
2013-02-16 07:40:31	PhoebosLC	So they will make a ton of money from this
2013-02-16 07:40:33	Justin	Indeed
2013-02-16 07:40:37	Justin	and run away
2013-02-16 07:40:38	Justin	when it crashes and burns
2013-02-16 07:41:27	AfterShave	Guys, the OUYA is going to have AirMech on it though
2013-02-16 07:41:45	AfterShave	That soundtrack, is possibly my most favourite music in the last year
2013-02-16 07:41:55	Justin	the OUYA has a LOT of fans for it, though
2013-02-16 07:42:06	Justin	AfterShave: Also think how cheap it will be when you upgrade every year
2013-02-16 07:42:08	GauHelldragon	hi Spekkio
2013-02-16 07:42:18	AfterShave	[16:38:59] <AfterShave> Think how cheap a single ouya is compared to it
2013-02-16 07:42:20	Justin	also you can hook up your phone to the TV
2013-02-16 07:42:22	AfterShave	Single OUYA
2013-02-16 07:42:25	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-16 07:42:27	Justin	anyawy
2013-02-16 07:42:27	AfterShave	:P
2013-02-16 07:42:29	Justin	anyway*
2013-02-16 07:42:38	Justin	The people who backed the OUYA probably own a computer anyway
2013-02-16 07:42:43	Justin	Why not just upgrade their computer
2013-02-16 07:42:43	Justin	:V
2013-02-16 07:42:44	GauHelldragon	!google ouya
2013-02-16 07:42:44	Turgid	http://www.google.com/search?q=ouya
2013-02-16 07:43:06	PhoebosLC	Because you cant play android games on PC
2013-02-16 07:43:07	PhoebosLC	Oh shit
2013-02-16 07:43:08	PhoebosLC	wait
2013-02-16 07:43:09	PhoebosLC	You can
2013-02-16 07:43:14	PhoebosLC	Hmmm
2013-02-16 07:43:35	AfterShave	This is actually a console vs pc master race thing isn't it?
2013-02-16 07:43:47	Justin	no not really
2013-02-16 07:43:54	PhoebosLC	It's more like "scam vs no scam"
2013-02-16 07:43:59	PhoebosLC	Actually isnt even a scam
2013-02-16 07:44:02	Justin	apparently the old model xbox is about as expensive as the OUYA
2013-02-16 07:44:14	PhoebosLC	It's just lots of idiots thinking that it's something more than a little android box
2013-02-16 07:44:17	PhoebosLC	Which it isnt
2013-02-16 07:44:34	Justin	also there are quite a number of people inquiring about adult games on the OUYA
2013-02-16 07:44:36	Justin	they want it
2013-02-16 07:44:46	Justin	also the shittiest games are being made on the OUYA right now
2013-02-16 07:44:47	AfterShave	"adult" games? :P
2013-02-16 07:44:54	Justin	so yeah
2013-02-16 07:44:59	GauHelldragon	uagggggggggh
2013-02-16 07:45:05	nuthulu	Yeah for stuff you can only do as an adult
2013-02-16 07:45:07	nuthulu	Tax forms etc
2013-02-16 07:45:10	GauHelldragon	i declare bacon pasta to not be success
2013-02-16 07:45:16	sandbox	if it has them then it will be successful ;p
2013-02-16 07:45:18	Spekkio	Hmmm
2013-02-16 07:45:21	PhoebosLC	How do you fail bacon pasta gau
2013-02-16 07:45:25	Justin	anyway what pisses me off is Julie Uhrman lying
2013-02-16 07:45:26	AfterShave	Hey, bacon pasta can be delicious
2013-02-16 07:45:30	GauHelldragon	did not drain grease
2013-02-16 07:45:30	AfterShave	I eat it for takeaway
2013-02-16 07:45:31	Spekkio	Stupid hardest-and-optional-puzzle-of-the-level
2013-02-16 07:45:35	PhoebosLC	Ohahhaha
2013-02-16 07:45:37	Spekkio	I WILL DEFEAT YOU
2013-02-16 07:45:42	Justin	"hurr durr there ARE NO GAMMING PLATFORMS THAT ARE OPEN LIKE THE UYA"
2013-02-16 07:45:51	PhoebosLC	Well uhh
2013-02-16 07:45:59	Justin	also
2013-02-16 07:46:00	GauHelldragon	i ate too much bacon fat and now 8 hours later i want to die
2013-02-16 07:46:02	PhoebosLC	There kinda isnt because PC isnt a gaming platform
2013-02-16 07:46:05	Justin	Double Fine adventure

2013-02-16 07:46:18	Justin	Julia Uhrman says that the OUYA will be the only way to play it on the TV
2013-02-16 07:46:25	-->	nuthulu (Mibbit@NewNet-4F541FB9.as13285.net) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-16 07:46:28	Justin	except: it's going to be released on the PC, Android, and iOS
2013-02-16 07:46:29	PhoebosLC	It can be one, sure, but I think she's just using BUZZWORDS instead of word console
2013-02-16 07:46:33	Justin	all of which can connect to the TV
2013-02-16 07:46:49	Justin	PhoebosLC: There's not enough BUZZWORDS on the OUYA yet
2013-02-16 07:46:57	GarthAlgar	one nickname for windows is wintendo, because it's only good for games
2013-02-16 07:47:04	GarthAlgar	so yeah, PC is a gaming platform ;D
2013-02-16 07:47:04	GauHelldragon	hu
2013-02-16 07:47:09	AfterShave	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT1T9L5ysGQ Speaking of that soundtrack
2013-02-16 07:47:09	Justin	anyway I have the feeling that most people are buying it to STICK IT TO THE MAN

2013-02-16 07:47:11	GauHelldragon	can't people make games for xbox
2013-02-16 07:47:22	GauHelldragon	the xbox live arcade thing
2013-02-16 07:47:26	GauHelldragon	or whatever
2013-02-16 07:47:29	Soadreqm	You need a PC to make games for XBox. :D
2013-02-16 07:47:31	Justin	also AfterShave the OUYA cut back on half of its promises after they reached their funding
2013-02-16 07:47:34	GarthAlgar	and still need approval by microsoft
2013-02-16 07:47:42	Justin	Because the OUYA people have no idea what they're doing
2013-02-16 07:47:50	Justin	that should set off red flags right there
2013-02-16 07:47:51	GauHelldragon	yeah but it can't hoestly be that hard to get approval
2013-02-16 07:47:54	GauHelldragon	i mean
2013-02-16 07:48:03	GauHelldragon	have you seen the shity stuff that's on it
2013-02-16 07:48:09	GarthAlgar	not much of it
2013-02-16 07:48:11	Justin	Also I've heard that the new Kickstarter rule change happened right after OUYA reached its funding goal
2013-02-16 07:48:18	GauHelldragon	anyway
2013-02-16 07:48:18	Justin	basically Kickstarter now bans concept models or something like that
2013-02-16 07:48:21	GarthAlgar	cause i don't fancy buying a console that comes with a monthly fee
2013-02-16 07:48:21	Justin	something which the OUYA did
2013-02-16 07:48:23	Justin	so... yeah
2013-02-16 07:48:33	Justin	Get a SteamBoy
2013-02-16 07:48:34	Justin	:V
2013-02-16 07:48:36	Justin	SteamBox*
2013-02-16 07:48:38	GauHelldragon	so ouya isn't going to have any sort of approval process
2013-02-16 07:48:45	sandbox	Steamboy TM
2013-02-16 07:48:51	GarthAlgar	it is, from what i gather
2013-02-16 07:48:53	nuthulu	Steamboy, it's like a pipboy
2013-02-16 07:48:56	nuthulu	But with steam!
2013-02-16 07:49:00	Soadreqm	Steamboy <3
2013-02-16 07:49:01	AfterShave	Steampunk fallout
2013-02-16 07:49:15	GarthAlgar	they just seem to claim they will greenlight everything, unless it's super obviously not acceptable
2013-02-16 07:49:23	PhoebosLC	SteamBoy: Now only 64% chance to scald your arm off
2013-02-16 07:49:32	nuthulu	"Hmm I could stop the master....Or I could play tf2"
2013-02-16 07:49:39	Justin	GauHelldragon: OUYA is going to have an approval process
2013-02-16 07:49:52	Justin	they basically bullshitted their whole "open" thing
2013-02-16 07:49:57	Soadreqm	Microsoft benefits from having a wide selection on their marketplace.
2013-02-16 07:49:58	GarthAlgar	tf2? got my tux! hooray
2013-02-16 07:50:17	GarthAlgar	from what i gather, people don't really buy many indies on xbox
2013-02-16 07:50:17	AfterShave	GarthAlgar's epeen has grown significantly from that item
2013-02-16 07:50:22	GauHelldragon	anyway
2013-02-16 07:50:25	AfterShave	You're RICH now
2013-02-16 07:50:28	Justin	also why is it using Android and Tegra anyway
2013-02-16 07:50:32	GauHelldragon	not that i have any problem with approval processes
2013-02-16 07:50:32	Justin	ANDROID IS MEANT TO BE MOBILE
2013-02-16 07:50:34	GarthAlgar	probably because the typical CoD gamer doesn't care and the whole shitty reputation of the titles
2013-02-16 07:50:35	Justin	TEGRA IS MEANT TO BE MOBILE
2013-02-16 07:50:45	AfterShave	I bought indies
2013-02-16 07:50:47	Justin	IF YOU'RE BUILDING A LIGHTWEIGHT CONSOLE USE LINUX AND A LOW-END GPU
2013-02-16 07:50:50	AfterShave	Then my xbox died
2013-02-16 07:50:51	GarthAlgar	AfterShave: it's level 78! just think about that
2013-02-16 07:50:52	Justin	MORE VALUE FOR MONEY
2013-02-16 07:50:53	Justin	:<
2013-02-16 07:50:56	GauHelldragon	nothing wrong with having standards
2013-02-16 07:51:13	AfterShave	The impossible game might seem like a terrible game, but it was great for killing time I'd say
2013-02-16 07:51:58	Kidiri	Sweet
2013-02-16 07:52:00	Justin	However the OUYA videos are absolutely CROWDED with fanboys

2013-02-16 07:53:22	AfterShave	You can't have a valid opinion Justin
2013-02-16 07:53:25	Justin	and the folks were like "NO NO NO OUYA WILL HAVE BETTER GAMES"
2013-02-16 07:53:25	AfterShave	Not on the internet
2013-02-16 07:53:38	Kidiri	Is that your opinion, AfterShave?
2013-02-16 07:53:42	Justin	Yes, amazing games like zombie stripper shooter
2013-02-16 07:53:48	AfterShave	Noooo, it's the hivemind's
2013-02-16 07:53:51	Kidiri	I'm afraid that won't do.

2013-02-16 07:57:02	Justin	anyway there is an overwhelming amount of people who are worshipping the OUYA right now
2013-02-16 07:57:13	Justin	I really can't wait for June

2013-02-16 08:16:58	AfterShave	Is a game I can't play well
2013-02-16 08:17:38	Kidiri	Is a game I don't even know the rules of.
2013-02-16 08:18:00	AfterShave	Roll dice, move markers and then there's more I don't know of
2013-02-16 08:18:44	Justin	What Kidiri said
2013-02-16 08:18:54	GarthAlgar	i have a chess/backgammon travel set
2013-02-16 08:19:04	GarthAlgar	i only ever played chess with it
2013-02-16 08:19:05	AfterShave	Do you have the bet multiplier dice?
2013-02-16 08:19:07	Kidiri	That also describes Monopoly, AfterShave.
2013-02-16 08:19:21	GarthAlgar	well, it has funky dice
2013-02-16 08:19:28	sandbox	they replaced the iron with a cat
2013-02-16 08:19:38	AfterShave	There's something about being able to up the bet to 64 times, seems excessive
2013-02-16 08:19:39	GarthAlgar	i have no real idea how backgammon works, so i guess i do, but i couldn't say if that was their purpose
2013-02-16 08:21:22	Justin	word on the street
2013-02-16 08:21:30	Justin	the OUYA is going to have a gaming magazine dedicated for it
2013-02-16 08:21:39	Justin	it's going to be sold in print
2013-02-16 08:21:57	Spekkio	Woo. I managed to open the third iron door.
2013-02-16 08:22:16	Spekkio	Thank goodness for prior puzzle solutions acting as hints for later puzzles.
2013-02-16 08:22:30	AfterShave	Are there alternative ways of going forward?
2013-02-16 08:22:33	Kidiri	Congrats, prepare to be smushed by a boulder.
2013-02-16 08:22:38	AfterShave	Like, melting said door, or casting some kind of "pass wall" spell?
2013-02-16 08:22:51	sandbox	Police Squad now?
2013-02-16 08:23:18	Spekkio	As far as I can tell, it's not that kind of game
2013-02-16 08:23:30	AfterShave	aWW
2013-02-16 08:23:45	Spekkio	I don't even know if those spells exist
2013-02-16 08:23:54	Justin	what game are you playing Spekkio?
2013-02-16 08:24:01	Spekkio	Legend of Grimrock
2013-02-16 08:24:24	Spekkio	It's about You vs. The Dungeon, which is fought largely on its terms
2013-02-16 08:24:59	AfterShave	Is there some explanation why it gets harder the further out you go? I still think the best security should be at the center
2013-02-16 08:25:31	Spekkio	ingame? I'm only at the third floor and my guys are still a long, long way from maxing out any skill
2013-02-16 08:25:37	Spekkio	so I think there's a long way for me to go
2013-02-16 08:25:42	Spekkio	so I have no idea!
2013-02-16 08:26:06	AfterShave	I mean, as far as I know the story is that your party was dropped in the center of the dungeon that is Grimrock, and you're working your way out
2013-02-16 08:26:19	Justin	I've played LoG before
2013-02-16 08:26:24	Justin	Don't patronise me :(
2013-02-16 08:26:36	AfterShave	What?
2013-02-16 08:26:43	Spekkio	It wasn't directed at you
2013-02-16 08:26:46	Justin	AfterShave: One would think that the hardest monsters would be at the top floor
2013-02-16 08:26:58	Justin	Spekkio: No it's not that sentence
2013-02-16 08:26:59	Justin	The other want

2013-02-16 08:27:16	Spekkio	That one wasn't directed at you either!
2013-02-16 08:27:30	Spekkio	I was replying to AS asking if there were alternative solutions
2013-02-16 08:27:36	Spekkio	you just don't have that much agency in this game
2013-02-16 08:27:44	nuthulu	That's a good point
2013-02-16 08:28:06	nuthulu	Why don't videogame villains but like their best shit at the first level or whatever if they know you're the only one that can stop them
2013-02-16 08:28:44	Justin	oh
2013-02-16 08:28:47	Justin	oh I get it
2013-02-16 08:28:51	Spekkio	Sometimes that results in them inadvertently saving the hero and kicking off their quest
2013-02-16 08:28:51	Justin	thanks for making me feel dumb

2013-02-16 08:46:19	Justin	I am sorry for her as well
2013-02-16 08:46:39	Spekkio	I guess it might be because the act of playing games involves getting seven people in a confined place and that many people makes heat
2013-02-16 08:46:48	Spekkio	and that means I do more sweating

2013-02-16 13:40:40	Kallisti	Sparring would be the only viable method of training that up. Although, that's a challenge in of itself. Also, demonstrations, but alas, decent teachers are few and far between.

2013-02-16 19:08:44	severian	gargantuan your seeds are stored in bags which are stored in barrels
2013-02-16 19:09:11	severian	with the new changes to the hauling system dwarves will now pickup containers so a bag barrel or bin and carry it around to collect seeds
2013-02-16 19:09:38	severian	unfortunatly this means that any other seeds stored in the barrel also come along for the ride and it prohibits access to them for any other dwarf
2013-02-16 19:10:47	severian	so all 170 seeds are being carried by a single dwarf as they move the storage container and any other dwarves that need them cannot reach them thus cancels job
2013-02-16 19:17:47	gargantuan	i've prohibited barrels on my seed stock pile
2013-02-16 19:17:54	gargantuan	and dumped all the seeds

2013-02-17 04:19:46	namad7	whelp impire seems like it might be a fun dungeon keeper style game but the campaign starts off slow and ploddingly and the missions are lengthy and a bit dull at least due to having so few options early on...
2013-02-17 04:20:17	namad7	biggest problem? i crash like every hour and i've had to replay entire early tutorial missions repeatedly to the point of...well.. i'm an idiot..next time i'm gonna start saving

2013-02-17 05:46:13	namad7	i wanna say it's a bit frantic and buggy
2013-02-17 05:46:28	namad7	and it's not so much about dungeon design
2013-02-17 05:46:35	namad7	as constantly babysitting squads of dungeon monsters
2013-02-17 05:46:53	namad7	and ordering them to teleport, attack, eat, train, upgrade etc that's like 90-99% of gameplay
2013-02-17 05:47:02	namad7	you can't unbuild anything ever
2013-02-17 05:47:06	namad7	and rooms need hallways between them
2013-02-17 05:47:15	namad7	and maps start with a bunch of rooms already on them, empty useless rooms you can't use
2013-02-17 05:47:18	namad7	there's no gold to dig up
2013-02-17 05:47:23	namad7	you gain most of your resources via combat
2013-02-17 05:47:34	namad7	combat which you're constantly directing minions to perform
2013-02-17 05:47:42	sandbox	there's no gold in them thar hills
2013-02-17 05:47:57	namad7	the overworld missions fit seemlessly into this system and are partially part ofthis constant combat resource system
2013-02-17 05:48:08	Justin	oh
2013-02-17 05:48:14	Justin	it looks like this is not the last day of the new year
2013-02-17 05:48:16	Justin	far from it
2013-02-17 05:48:20	Justin	it's actually the most important day
2013-02-17 05:48:23	Justin	and it's only halfway
2013-02-17 05:48:25	Justin	OH GOD THE FIREWORKS
2013-02-17 05:48:27	Justin	HOW DO I SLEEP
2013-02-17 05:48:27	namad7	traps are also quite weak, so like a trap will deal like 10% damage to an enemy hero, and often heroes can heal, and there's a max trap limit and it's like 30-50% of the max minion limit
2013-02-17 05:48:37	namad7	so impire is extremely unfaithful to dungeonkeeper
2013-02-17 05:48:57	namad7	it's all about the minions, and there's really no dungeon designing, and traps are just small debuffs mostly good to help your suads defend chokepoints
2013-02-17 05:49:11	namad7	that said it's less insulting than dungeons by kalypso was
2013-02-17 05:50:06	namad7	but you basically just throw down rooms in the few possible locations available for rooms to go in, then spam a bunch of clicks to control your monsters in real time, without pause, there's a ton of stuff to do but none of it very strategic and a lot of it just busy work
2013-02-17 05:50:34	namad7	it's pretty tough to get your squads to eat and train when you want because they won't return to their previous position afterwards
2013-02-17 05:50:44	namad7	and if you teleport them straight there to save time they lose even more of their orders
2013-02-17 05:50:50	Justin	guys Tom Clancy vs Sid Meier
2013-02-17 05:50:53	namad7	but teleporting them costs nothing and saves like 5minutes so you have to do it
2013-02-17 05:50:54	Justin	whose name is the most game of all?
2013-02-17 05:50:59	namad7	and do it and do it 1000times
2013-02-17 05:51:20	namad7	it keeps you from having to ever sit around waiting on movements but it also forces you to do a lot of fairly unfun clicking
2013-02-17 05:51:46	namad7	workers are basically free, and there's no reason to avoid letting them die, and they don't actually do very much either
2013-02-17 05:51:59	namad7	it's a decent game, but it feels like whoever designed it literally never played dungeonkeeper ever
2013-02-17 05:53:36	namad7	i guess that at least leaves some space for war for the overworld to suck less
2013-02-17 05:55:12	namad7	impire is basically the evolution of modern dungeon keeper styles games, all of which sucked horribly and so evolving them was a bad idea, because going back to the roots would've been 1000% smarter move
2013-02-17 05:57:38	Justin	So impire sucks?

2013-02-17 09:32:37	Soadreqm	It's just that he reanimates every corpse he sees.
2013-02-17 09:33:17	Soadreqm	And the zombies? Yeah, the zombies are kinda unaligned.

2013-02-17 09:39:05	PhoebosLC	Thats why you use moats for contaiment
2013-02-17 09:39:51	Malachite	well, a archer facility would be easy
2013-02-17 09:39:56	Malachite	lava moat + bridge
2013-02-17 09:40:29	Soadreqm	Hmmm. Maybe I should try to set up something like that.
2013-02-17 09:41:25	Malachite	28 seconds of lag woo
2013-02-17 09:41:25	Soadreqm	It should be possible with an allied necromancer, since you can move him wherever you like.
2013-02-17 09:41:46	Soadreqm	I wouldn't try luring an enemy necromancer through my fort, though.

2013-02-17 11:25:37	Soadreqm	As for the vampire? Well, the only thing he's going to do is murder a dwarf every now and then. All par for the course for a king.

2013-02-17 11:26:52	fcrick	sandbox: are blocks faster?
2013-02-17 11:27:17	Soadreqm	You're SUPPOSED to pick the guilty one, but when the guilty dwarf is your king? Yeah, a lot more fun to just oppress the working classes.
2013-02-17 11:27:19	sandbox	fcrick: yes
2013-02-17 11:27:31	Soadreqm	You could also lock him in his room forever and keep him there.

2013-02-17 11:28:10	sandbox	a bridge under a river... wouldn't that be a tunnel?
2013-02-17 11:28:11	fcrick	like, i have a ramp to to the tile below the river
2013-02-17 11:28:12	Soadreqm	Do you even still get liasons after the king
2013-02-17 11:28:12	Zackariah	Well my baron all ready died

2013-02-17 11:28:21	Zackariah	He went crazy and murdered his wife in bed with his torusers
2013-02-17 11:28:29	Zackariah	Im not sure
2013-02-17 11:28:32	fcrick	like, i want to do a controlled flood
2013-02-17 11:28:39	Zackariah	trousers*
2013-02-17 11:28:51	fcrick	does a bridge need to be a certain minimum size?
2013-02-17 11:29:00	Zackariah	Nope
2013-02-17 11:29:03	Zackariah	You can make a 1 tile bridge
2013-02-17 11:29:09	Zackariah	That will fucntion just the same
2013-02-17 11:30:00	fcrick	should i make it 'retracts'?
2013-02-17 11:30:58	fcrick	it says it needs a walkable perimeter i guess i'll try digging out the block next to it
2013-02-17 11:31:14	fcrick	hopefully the water doesn't go diagonally under a bridge

2013-02-17 11:34:28	fcrick	i think i need to make it like a straight line to the river's edge

2013-02-17 13:41:35	Kidiri	Well, if the area is large enough
2013-02-17 13:41:41	Kidiri	I should eventually evaporate.

2013-02-17 14:51:04	uristmchambel	in order to keep my military from complaining about long patrol routes, do i set every other month or so as no scheduled order?

2013-02-17 20:57:06	 *	Spekkio is playing some gmod
2013-02-17 20:57:23	Spekkio	My initial goal was to rebuild my old PD turret
2013-02-17 20:59:41	Spekkio	but while I was looking at all the different ways I could constrain the turret (which I have looked at many times with no satisfactory solution) I happened to be playing with ball sockets to see if there was an easier way
2013-02-17 21:00:00	Spekkio	(basically I want to allow pitch and yaw movement while preventing roll)
2013-02-17 21:02:40	Spekkio	and while so far I've failed at that, I just tried changing (reversing) the anchor points of the ball sockets. And suddenly ALL THE IDEAS. The new turret is going to look fricking awesome.
2013-02-17 21:11:19	Spekkio	One of the best things is that the new design should only need.... 1/3 of the thrusters as the old one.
2013-02-17 21:11:28	uristmchambel	tantrums are so annoying
2013-02-17 21:11:39	Spekkio	Maybe 2/3 if I'm still having to use thrusters to control roll.
2013-02-17 21:13:50	Makrond	why not just physically constrain it
2013-02-17 21:15:26	Makrond	wait i guess that would only work if you don't need it to point down
2013-02-17 21:15:32	Makrond	(or up)
2013-02-17 21:27:15	Spekkio	Yeah. Currently with ball sockets I can allow rotation in one or three axes, but I don't know how to do two

2013-02-17 23:01:41	Makrond	so many cool tricks you can do but i just never really practiced with him enough

2013-02-18 04:14:23	Justin	sup assholes
2013-02-18 04:14:41	Justin	so XNA is dying
2013-02-18 04:14:46	@smeding	not much, you little shit
2013-02-18 04:14:47	Justin	But I suppose I should still use XNA though
2013-02-18 04:14:57	Justin	After all you can still make games for the PC
2013-02-18 04:15:03	@smeding	why is XNA dying
2013-02-18 04:15:06	Justin	although it doesn't work so well on Windows 8
2013-02-18 04:15:12	Justin	MS officially dropped support for it
2013-02-18 04:15:17	@smeding	ah
2013-02-18 04:15:18	Justin	I mean
2013-02-18 04:15:20	Justin	on 2014
2013-02-18 04:15:21	sandbox	nothign works well on windows 8 including notepad
2013-02-18 04:16:01	Justin	It will drop all support for it on 2014
2013-02-18 04:16:01	Justin	no more XBLIG publishing I believe
2013-02-18 04:16:02	@smeding	sounds fun
2013-02-18 04:16:04	Justin	Are there any other cool frameworks out there for games
2013-02-18 04:16:10	Justin	oh wait monogame
2013-02-18 04:16:14	@smeding	eh
2013-02-18 04:16:26	Justin	which is basically multiplatform XNA I believe???
2013-02-18 04:16:31	@smeding	no idea
2013-02-18 04:16:35	@smeding	XNA is probably the best documented
2013-02-18 04:16:37	Justin	do you know any
2013-02-18 04:16:40	Justin	uhuh
2013-02-18 04:16:44	@smeding	there's stuff like OGRE
2013-02-18 04:16:55	@smeding	but that's C++ and C++ is butts
2013-02-18 04:16:55	Justin	but I haven't heard great things about that
2013-02-18 04:16:59	Justin	well I want python
2013-02-18 04:17:02	Justin	XNA supports python I think
2013-02-18 04:17:07	@smeding	it does?
2013-02-18 04:17:11	@smeding	i thought it was a .NET thing
2013-02-18 04:17:16	@smeding	what kind of game do you want to make
2013-02-18 04:20:51	Justin	oh I don't know
2013-02-18 04:20:59	Justin	I plan to make a Tactics styled game one day
2013-02-18 04:21:37	Justin	hmm maybe XNA doesn't support Python
2013-02-18 04:21:40	Justin	I remembered it having python though
2013-02-18 04:21:44	Justin	so...???

2013-02-18 04:22:00	Justin	ah there we go
2013-02-18 04:22:01	Justin	there is
2013-02-18 04:22:28	Justin	it says that you can't develop games for the windows phone and xbox though, totally fine with that
2013-02-18 04:22:35	gargantuan	python doesn't really have anything useful
2013-02-18 04:22:37	Justin	I remembered that it can't support those platforms, yeah
2013-02-18 04:22:42	Justin	gargantuan: It's easy to learn though
2013-02-18 04:22:50	gargantuan	you can use Boo in Unity that is close
2013-02-18 04:22:53	Justin	I figured it would be a great place to start from
2013-02-18 04:22:56	Justin	nah I don't want Unity
2013-02-18 04:23:02	gargantuan	why not
2013-02-18 04:23:15	Justin	idk it's either limited or it's too expensive
2013-02-18 04:23:16	Justin	from what I'm seeing

2013-02-18 04:23:53	Justin	also how well does Unity support 2d games?
2013-02-18 04:23:55	gargantuan	well it depends what you want to do, Flash is still a good free choice and the ipad stuff i've made with Flash runs better than on my PC laptop in some situations
2013-02-18 04:24:03	gargantuan	then there are lua things like love2d
2013-02-18 04:24:09	Justin	I've seen love2d
2013-02-18 04:24:13	Justin	seems a little weird thoguh
2013-02-18 04:24:16	Justin	doesn't look serious
2013-02-18 04:24:44	gargantuan	yeah no idea what you're doing, for 2D Starling Framework and Flash / Air are the winners, i recently spent a couple of months researching it for a work job
2013-02-18 04:24:53	gargantuan	since we're targeting android, ios and desktops
2013-02-18 04:25:06	gargantuan	http://gamua.com/starling/
2013-02-18 04:25:17	gargantuan	and all the tooling is free
2013-02-18 04:25:18	Justin	never heard of this Starling
2013-02-18 04:25:24	Justin	well that sounds sweet
2013-02-18 04:25:29	gargantuan	except you have to buy a license to build the native iOS/Android apps
2013-02-18 04:25:33	Justin	idk man but I've always got the impression that Flash is resource hogging
2013-02-18 04:25:42	gargantuan	not really
2013-02-18 04:25:50	gargantuan	python is way worse
2013-02-18 04:26:00	gargantuan	problem is these muck languages attract bad programmers
2013-02-18 04:26:27	gargantuan	learning AGAL is a bit of a headache, but it's directly applicable to dx and opengl in terms of programming knowledge/process reuse
2013-02-18 04:27:20	gargantuan	pyglet is an okay Python opengl abstraction, i wrote this in it ages ago http://code.google.com/p/imptux/
2013-02-18 04:27:50	gargantuan	Unity costs because like UDK and Adobes main suite it has proper tooling for serious software production

2013-02-18 04:28:27	Justin	also people won't take my game as seriously if it's in Flash
2013-02-18 04:28:28	Justin	but oh well
2013-02-18 04:28:30	Justin	:V
2013-02-18 04:28:45	gargantuan	if it's running on ios or android they will have no idea
2013-02-18 04:28:59	gargantuan	but yeah browser flash has a small stigma amongst mentally retarded people, that's for sure
2013-02-18 04:29:32	sandbox	microsoft is looking after flash for windows 8
2013-02-18 04:30:06	gargantuan	struggling with py2exe, having no meaningful types for working with data structures in any high performance manner (numpy is okay but not super useful compared to some of Adobes types) makes python a bit of a  hassle

2013-02-18 04:30:20	gargantuan	not to mention pyglet really can't catch as many edge cases as people with real money
2013-02-18 04:31:07	gargantuan	all the javascript game libraries suck at the moment, the browser space isn't really a consistent platform making all kinds of optimization and code headaches
2013-02-18 04:31:13	gargantuan	implementation- it's a messy bitch
2013-02-18 04:31:53	Justin	well I don't plan to make games for mobile
2013-02-18 04:31:54	Justin	at least not yet
2013-02-18 04:31:59	Justin	not planning anything too big

2013-02-18 04:33:26	Spekkio	I just shut my finger in a cupboard
2013-02-18 04:33:56	Justin	anyway I don't want to learn a language that is hard to learn :(
2013-02-18 04:33:57	Spekkio	no blood, but I expect bruising
2013-02-18 04:34:01	Justin	I prefer to learn something easier first
2013-02-18 04:34:03	Nuklearni-okurka	I read that as "shot my finger off"
2013-02-18 04:34:19	Spekkio	well that would probably be more painful
2013-02-18 04:34:43	Nuklearni-okurka	I dunno, man
2013-02-18 04:35:12	gargantuan	c#, java, flash, javascript, boo, python, lua, etc are all much of a muchness in difficulty
2013-02-18 04:35:27	gargantuan	if you use c#, java, javascript, or flash you're using languages that have transferable value
2013-02-18 04:35:44	gargantuan	python is sadly falling by the way side, i only use it for virtual machien automation these days
2013-02-18 04:36:11	gargantuan	shame cause c#, java, javascript and flash are crap languages
2013-02-18 04:36:21	gargantuan	after you've played with something fun
2013-02-18 04:36:47	gargantuan	anyway unity is fine if you aren't targeting mobile

2013-02-18 04:42:26	Spekkio	So anyway I get my friggin E2 chip in gmod, slap it on a prop, and program it to output its own orientation (in pitch, yaw, roll)
2013-02-18 04:43:39	Spekkio	and it says 90, 0, 180

2013-02-18 04:45:16	Justin	gargantuan: Isn't unity targeting mobile, though?
2013-02-18 04:45:23	Justin	it's basically THE 3d engine for mobile deveolpment
2013-02-18 04:45:25	Justin	development*
2013-02-18 04:45:28	Justin	almost every 3d game is unity nowadays
2013-02-18 04:45:49	gargantuan	it can target flash player
2013-02-18 04:45:53	Justin	anyway I think I'll just learn python first, then proceed to learn another language at a faster pace

2013-02-18 04:46:20	Spekkio	I want to try using the chip itself to output the thrust to aim the turret I'm building around it... and with the way I'm trying it, the location of the chip can't really move
2013-02-18 04:46:31	Spekkio	relative to the block it's attached to
2013-02-18 04:46:54	gargantuan	well Justin stay the fuck away from pygame is all i'll say
2013-02-18 04:47:15	Spekkio	One time I tried to learn pygame... I think that was a mistake
2013-02-18 04:47:25	Spekkio	I wish someone ad warned me away from it beforehand
2013-02-18 04:47:50	gargantuan	i've used it for a few projects, also done a lot with SDL over the years (hence pygame)
2013-02-18 04:48:04	gargantuan	so i have plenty of well reasoned explanations for why SDL and Pygame can fuck off :)
2013-02-18 04:48:17	gargantuan	gargantuan | piman: what would you suggest someone wanting to learn python and do game dev should use? pyglet? something else?
2013-02-18 04:48:19	Justin	brb
2013-02-18 04:48:23	Justin	yeah pygame looks horrible
2013-02-18 04:48:25	gargantuan	piman | I don't think Python is a good choice at all.
2013-02-18 04:48:31	gargantuan	gargantuan | right i can't dissuade him of that
2013-02-18 04:48:36	gargantuan	piman | No chance of Boo in Unity? :/
2013-02-18 04:48:39	gargantuan	well there you go
2013-02-18 04:48:41	Spekkio	so currently what the chip claims to be "pitch" is really the turret's "roll", and it's 90 degrees offset. So if I tell the chip "OK turn so that pitch is 0" the whole thing ends up on its side and working out what the fuck the turret's pitch and yaw are in this buggered convention system is something I really don't want to approach

2013-02-18 04:52:27	Justin	what's SDL?
2013-02-18 04:53:46	gargantuan	it's an outmoded approach to software display buffer access written in C
2013-02-18 04:54:01	gargantuan	it predates modern GPU computing basically
2013-02-18 04:54:07	gargantuan	its what pygame is based on
2013-02-18 04:54:25	gargantuan	it's only existing value is that it has cross platform input support
2013-02-18 04:54:32	gargantuan	i use the joystick stuff with pyglet
2013-02-18 04:54:47	Justin	doesn't DF use SDL
2013-02-18 04:56:25	Justin	so is pyglet good for games?
2013-02-18 04:56:54	gargantuan	DF uses SDL yeah
2013-02-18 04:57:01	gargantuan	it's a convenient way to render software buffers
2013-02-18 04:57:17	gargantuan	in a staticly typed language all its problems are ameloriated a bit

2013-02-18 05:02:24	Justin	well they aren't for me, personally
2013-02-18 05:02:28	sandbox	I thought about saying something to that effect
2013-02-18 05:02:29	Justin	yeah around there I suppose
2013-02-18 05:02:47	gargantuan	i think of a manual more like the badly translated flatpack or electronics instructions i get with MANUAL printed on them
2013-02-18 05:02:55	gargantuan	which is what most guides tend to be
2013-02-18 05:03:09	gargantuan	i would call api material simply documentation or reference

2013-02-18 11:51:49	GauHelldragon	in oblivion it's VERY fucking easy to fuck up and make a shitty character and have to screw up
2013-02-18 11:51:52	RPharazon	It allows you to do more things in character creation

2013-02-18 18:37:31	gargantuan	or stop playing

2013-02-18 18:38:18	gargantuan	i had a bount of depressed dwarves
2013-02-18 18:38:21	gargantuan	it was becaquse none of them had shirts
2013-02-18 18:38:36	gargantuan	you just have to make sure you are actually playing the game rather than just bossing them around
2013-02-18 18:38:40	gargantuan	and it'll sort itself out

2013-02-18 18:39:38	uristmchambel	actually, i have never done that
2013-02-18 18:39:40	gargantuan	heh
2013-02-18 18:39:50	uristmchambel	thanks
2013-02-18 18:40:25	Zackariah	Well they usually come with clothes
2013-02-18 18:40:34	Zackariah	sometimes they get a little angry over old clothes though
2013-02-18 18:40:53	gargantuan	i'm not sure how my few got naked the other day
2013-02-18 18:40:57	Zackariah	Also they tantrum when they are depressed
2013-02-18 18:41:02	gargantuan	i'm wondering if they dumped their clothes to pick up new ones
2013-02-18 18:41:09	gargantuan	and then the new ones got forbidden
2013-02-18 18:41:12	gargantuan	because of some stuff i was doing
2013-02-18 18:42:05	Zackariah	Im trying out masterwork right now. generatating the world now. I couldnt figure out how to get bisasam tileset to work with the launcher though
2013-02-18 18:42:22	gargantuan	what's masterwork
2013-02-18 18:43:02	Zackariah	A huge mod that adds a lot of new stuff. including playable as orc fortresses and kobald villages
2013-02-18 18:43:07	Zackariah	And lots of balance changes
2013-02-18 18:43:10	gargantuan	whoa
2013-02-18 18:43:50	Zackariah	http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=98196.0
2013-02-18 18:44:13	gargantuan	yeah reading atm
2013-02-18 18:44:46	Zackariah	Oh yeah and it adds rune forges to enhance weapons. And mage schools to train dwarfs.
2013-02-18 18:45:10	gargantuan	trying to work out how to improve the training of my current dwarf army
2013-02-18 18:45:27	gargantuan	if i have a militia commander with high skill will that improve the training rate
2013-02-18 18:45:28	Zackariah	Just make them train 24/7
2013-02-18 18:45:37	gargantuan	ok
2013-02-18 18:45:44	Zackariah	And Im not sure
2013-02-18 18:45:56	Zackariah	Having someone with a high skill will help though because they will hold demonstrations
2013-02-18 18:46:07	Zackariah	Not sure if it matters if theyre captain or not
2013-02-18 18:46:20	gargantuan	yeah that's what i wanted to know, if the position mattered
2013-02-18 18:46:21	gargantuan	all good
2013-02-18 18:46:28	Zackariah	But once youre able to name a champion if you name a high skill level it will train all your other dwarves a lot faster
2013-02-18 18:46:40	gargantuan	i don't get why my dorfs take their kids into battle
2013-02-18 18:46:42	gargantuan	it's a real problem
2013-02-18 18:46:55	Zackariah	Cheap shields
2013-02-18 18:47:07	gargantuan	they keep getting wounded
2013-02-18 18:47:12	gargantuan	3 kids with broken bones
2013-02-18 18:47:20	gargantuan	i guess once they are all in hospital
2013-02-18 18:47:23	gargantuan	it wont matter
2013-02-18 18:47:24	Zackariah	Just finish them off. Its humane
2013-02-18 18:47:30	Zackariah	Make the hospital dump into magma
2013-02-18 18:47:39	gargantuan	haha
2013-02-18 18:47:42	Zackariah	The fortress doesnt need cripples
2013-02-18 18:48:26	Zackariah	Oh but whats interesting is that I checked the legends for my region of the fortress i lost recently
2013-02-18 18:49:12	Zackariah	and after an unknown group laid siege to my fortress and destroyed it they formed a new civilization and took home in my old fort
2013-02-18 18:50:15	gargantuan	haha
2013-02-18 18:50:19	gargantuan	how'd the destroy it
2013-02-18 18:51:09	Zackariah	Well after I had a huge battle and lost my favorite hammerlord i got  bored and started killing my own dwarves
2013-02-18 18:51:17	Zackariah	I set up ballistas in the meeting hall and fired at will
2013-02-18 18:51:37	Zackariah	And then i locked the vampire king up in a dungeon and through trolls in and forced him to fight them untill he got gored to death
2013-02-18 18:52:00	Zackariah	Then some golbins came and just strolled in to some hellhole of guts and finsihed off what was rest
2013-02-18 18:55:55	uristmchambel	how do you train 24/7 without them complaining about long patrol routes?
2013-02-18 18:57:01	gargantuan	they get used to it
2013-02-18 18:57:09	gargantuan	also i have given every soldier a very nice bedroom

2013-02-18 19:15:55	therealfakemoot	I think it's because they only allow vertical travel
2013-02-18 19:16:07	therealfakemoot	It drastically reduces the number of possible paths through your central stairwell

2013-02-19 11:48:25	uristmchambel	but I don't know for sure
2013-02-19 11:48:51	uristmchambel	Yeah idk
2013-02-19 11:49:12	uristmchambel	you should see metal clothing as well in masterwork, so there is that
2013-02-19 11:50:02	roushguy	I have...
2013-02-19 11:50:11	roushguy	But I've only ever seen a couple golden cloaks
2013-02-19 11:50:47	roushguy	And that was on a kobold.
2013-02-19 11:50:57	uristmchambel	sounds about right

2013-02-19 12:20:44	uristmchambel	first I need to read the silmarillion though
2013-02-19 12:23:48	roushguy	If you want a good series of books to read that often touches on the fae
2013-02-19 12:23:53	roushguy	Read the Harry Dresden books

2013-02-19 12:26:07	roushguy	Hm...

2013-02-19 12:27:17	roushguy	...
2013-02-19 12:27:21	roushguy	I want to create giant bees.
2013-02-19 12:27:24	Kidiri	If you want to read the series that all that was inspired by, read the Greek myths.
2013-02-19 12:27:24	roushguy	Like...
2013-02-19 12:27:27	roushguy	Car-sized.
2013-02-19 12:27:38	roushguy	Bees.
2013-02-19 12:27:50	namad8	garrett pi is extremely similar to dresden files and i believe jim butcher sites it as inspiration i wasn't just spouting nonsense
2013-02-19 12:28:06	namad8	the main difference is that garrett pi is in a fantasy world and the main character isn't a wizard
2013-02-19 12:28:10	namad8	but just about everything else is the same
2013-02-19 12:28:14	roushguy	He does cite it as inspiration
2013-02-19 12:28:29	namad8	in that there are wizards and ogres and goblins and vampires and the main character is a private investigator
2013-02-19 12:28:56	roushguy	Anyhoo...
2013-02-19 12:29:01	roushguy	How do I make a syndrome?
2013-02-19 12:29:08	roushguy	Can I make it give a good effect?

2013-02-19 12:32:22	roushguy	Hmm.
2013-02-19 12:32:30	nuthulu	There's some stuff on the wiki, although it's not brilliantly helpful
2013-02-19 12:32:37	roushguy	Giant bees that remove the blood tag?
2013-02-19 12:33:11	uristmchambel	I will check it out
2013-02-19 12:34:18	nuthulu	Kidiri yeah me and Nintendo are still negotiating that out

2013-02-19 12:42:04	Kidiri	And replaced with Bidoof?
2013-02-19 12:42:23	roushguy	Kidiri, think about this
2013-02-19 12:42:39	roushguy	A syndrome that dwarves get from a rare booze
2013-02-19 12:42:45	roushguy	Like /candy/ rare.
2013-02-19 12:43:03	roushguy	And when they get this syndrome, about the time they'd start getting a bad thought from lack of booze
2013-02-19 12:43:14	roushguy	The syndrome removes their need for alcohol.
2013-02-19 12:43:16	nuthulu	Drop bidoofs into North Korea
2013-02-19 12:43:22	Kidiri	Sunshine?
2013-02-19 12:43:53	Kidiri	Sunshine's pretty rare.
2013-02-19 12:44:00	Kidiri	Also, I initially was confused
2013-02-19 12:44:01	roushguy	Ehh... Maybe rarer.
2013-02-19 12:44:17	Kidiri	And thought nuthulu was going on about Bidoof and rare candies.
2013-02-19 12:44:36	Kidiri	And I was all like "He's switched the words around."
2013-02-19 12:44:37	nuthulu	Rare candies are clearly steroids
2013-02-19 12:45:04	roushguy	Yeah, but they screw with EV values, don't they?
2013-02-19 12:45:08	roushguy	Anyhow
2013-02-19 12:45:43	roushguy	Let me think...
2013-02-19 12:45:55	roushguy	Is there a way to require more than one item for a brewing?
2013-02-19 12:46:19	nuthulu	Yeah but you can always use some FEV to evolve them faster, although then you get the problem of supermutants/centaurs/the master/ the boss from fallout 2
2013-02-19 12:46:40	Kidiri	Make your own workshop, roushguy.
2013-02-19 12:46:47	roushguy	Hmm...
2013-02-19 12:46:51	roushguy	The Mixery.
2013-02-19 12:46:52	Kidiri	Don't know how that works, though.
2013-02-19 12:47:04	roushguy	I was thinking you take mead
2013-02-19 12:47:08	roushguy	Mix it with sun berries
2013-02-19 12:47:22	Kidiri	Add a frosting of gold...

2013-02-19 12:47:30	roushguy	Add some plump helmet seeds.

2013-02-19 12:49:16	Kidiri	Because as it is, you can make a lot of it.

2013-02-19 12:49:59	Kidiri	Maybe some candy?
2013-02-19 12:50:16	roushguy	gawd
2013-02-19 12:50:20	roushguy	That's worse than stone.
2013-02-19 12:50:25	roushguy	It'd rip and tear your guts.

2013-02-19 12:59:12	nuthulu	Although honestly Skyrim is more satisfying as a stealth game, despite the fact that draugr and dragons can basically avoid any sort of stealth
2013-02-19 12:59:27	roushguy	Only certain draugr
2013-02-19 13:02:41	nuthulu	Well I find some of them have the fun tendency of just lying down in walls, meaning I can't get behind them

2013-02-19 19:09:40	uristmchambel	He was a pikeman
2013-02-19 19:09:46	roushguy	Pike.
2013-02-19 19:09:55	roushguy	Then you need to build his tomb sticking out of the ground
2013-02-19 19:10:02	roushguy	Go up like ten z-levels
2013-02-19 19:10:07	roushguy	Build the blade
2013-02-19 19:10:14	uristmchambel	He likes running water so i might build a water temple
2013-02-19 19:10:21	uristmchambel	so that will fit in perfectly
2013-02-19 19:10:25	uristmchambel	thanks :)
2013-02-19 19:10:33	roushguy	Then make the whole haft an archer tower
2013-02-19 19:10:36	roushguy	So like
2013-02-19 19:10:46	roushguy	Ten z-levels of fortifications, then waterfalls at the top
2013-02-19 19:10:54	roushguy	Pouring down and protecting the archers
2013-02-19 19:11:02	roushguy	Who enter only via underground tunnel
2013-02-19 19:11:24	roushguy	I have great ideas, I just suck too much at DF to be able to do them

2013-02-19 19:11:24	roushguy	Also
2013-02-19 19:11:30	roushguy	If you build it now
2013-02-19 19:11:32	roushguy	Before he dies
2013-02-19 19:11:38	roushguy	Reassign his hospital bed there
2013-02-19 19:11:44	roushguy	So he can die in his own tomb.

2013-02-19 20:08:33	fennec	staircase?
2013-02-19 20:08:42	roushguy	uristmchambel, easy
2013-02-19 20:08:49	fennec	or ramps if you prefer
2013-02-19 20:08:49	roushguy	Make a channel in the spot you want the well
2013-02-19 20:08:54	roushguy	Dig to a water source
2013-02-19 20:08:59	roushguy	Stop one block away
2013-02-19 20:09:06	roushguy	Go topside and channel it from there
2013-02-19 20:09:06	fennec	install floodgate :D
2013-02-19 20:09:12	roushguy	No nee
2013-02-19 20:09:14	roushguy	Need*
2013-02-19 20:09:16	roushguy	Not for a well
2013-02-19 20:09:48	uristmchambel	If I'm sourcing it from a river do I need a floodgate?
2013-02-19 20:09:54	fennec	not strictly speaking
2013-02-19 20:10:03	fennec	not if the chamber is on the same level
2013-02-19 20:10:03	uristmchambel	I don't know anything about df water pressure
2013-02-19 20:10:07	uristmchambel	ok
2013-02-19 20:10:54	uristmchambel	I'm going to do this
2013-02-19 20:11:09	uristmchambel	for some reasons wells have always scared me
2013-02-19 20:11:13	uristmchambel	but I've got this
2013-02-19 20:11:14	roushguy	heh
2013-02-19 20:11:16	fennec	it works similar to how you'd expect it in real life. if you hook it up to a river, dig down 30 levels and then over a little and then up like 2 levels, you're probably going to get flooded
2013-02-19 20:11:19	roushguy	I remember once
2013-02-19 20:11:31	roushguy	I built a fort, actually didn't fail in the first year
2013-02-19 20:11:44	roushguy	And eventually got a hammerdorf all the way to champion status
2013-02-19 20:11:59	roushguy	Named him after myself, and he was swinging around with the artifact hammer he'd made.
2013-02-19 20:12:08	roushguy	From lead, I think it was. Been a loooooong time.
2013-02-19 20:12:28	roushguy	Well, eventually, he cracked and went insane. Slaughtered my whole fort.
2013-02-19 20:12:41	fennec	whoops
2013-02-19 20:12:42	uristmchambel	haha
2013-02-19 20:12:45	roushguy	Was rather humorous, up until he fell into magma and died.
2013-02-19 20:12:51	roushguy	Then I was like
2013-02-19 20:12:52	roushguy	DAMMIT
2013-02-19 20:12:58	fennec	urist: if you're really really paranoid, you hook up a floodgate and an emergency drain. (which can be done by digging down far enough into a cavern, or over to the edge of a map and then carving fortifications in the wall - the water can drain out the edges.)
2013-02-19 20:13:24	uristmchambel	do grates keep creatures out?
2013-02-19 20:13:26	uristmchambel	and thank you
2013-02-19 20:14:03	fennec	grates keep out most creatures that aren't going to slaughter your entire fortress anyway ;)

2013-02-19 20:14:53	RPharazon|NB	Damn
2013-02-19 20:16:14	uristmchambel	nice
2013-02-19 20:17:08	uristmchambel	I'm going to start on a migrant quarantine zone right quick and then do the well
2013-02-19 20:17:13	fennec	bad news is that mr. Ralkutam didn't learn a thing about masonry from his experience
2013-02-19 20:17:27	fennec	(with the weapons rack and all)

2013-02-19 20:21:00	roushguy	Shouldn't that be metalworking?
2013-02-19 20:21:03	roushguy	Since he used gold?
2013-02-19 20:23:16	fennec	native gold nuggets count as rock
2013-02-19 20:23:27	fennec	that's what you get when you don't smelt it
2013-02-19 20:25:10	uristmchambel	can't you cut gold like a gem?
2013-02-19 20:25:56	fennec	you can have a jewelry shop cut most rocks, i think
2013-02-19 20:26:28	roushguy	Idea
2013-02-19 20:26:43	roushguy	Someone triple the values on chainmail and call it king's mail
2013-02-19 20:26:56	uristmchambel	why does one of my dwarves say that he was forced to drink vomit lately?
2013-02-19 20:26:58	uristmchambel	wtf
2013-02-19 20:27:09	uristmchambel	roushguy nice
2013-02-19 20:27:27	roushguy	Including its size thing
2013-02-19 20:27:37	roushguy	So that one set of king's mail equates three chainmails.
2013-02-19 20:28:13	roushguy	So instead of three chainmails under a plate, it's only a king's mail underneath
2013-02-19 20:28:18	roushguy	Make chainmail shaped, too

2013-02-19 20:36:58	roushguy	You wear your vambraces on your arms, and your gauntlets on your hands
2013-02-19 20:37:15	roushguy	Chainmail kirtle and greaves on your legs
2013-02-19 20:37:18	roushguy	And feet in boots

2013-02-19 20:42:15	roushguy	my bad, sword's two pounds, twelve ounces
2013-02-19 20:42:45	roushguy	And a shield was a whopping twelve pounds, four ounces.
2013-02-19 20:43:23	roushguy	So you've got nearly eighty pounds of metal and leather on you.
2013-02-19 20:43:29	roushguy	They /fought/ in that
2013-02-19 20:45:19	uristmchambel	that is insane
2013-02-19 20:47:12	roushguy	Yeah.
2013-02-19 20:47:30	roushguy	For reference, modern soldiers have, I think, fourty pounds of gear

2013-02-19 20:48:27	uristmchambel	dang
2013-02-19 20:48:30	roushguy	They fight in fourty pounds of gear, with fifty pound assault packs on their back (designed in such a way to feel much lighter)
2013-02-19 20:48:47	roushguy	The packs are usually left in the vehicles
2013-02-19 20:49:02	roushguy	So almost /half/ what a knight fought with

2013-02-20 10:49:20	roushguy	While dragonscale is fairly common
2013-02-20 10:49:25	roushguy	What people really want is the bones
2013-02-20 10:49:35	roushguy	Since dragons only require heat to stay alive
2013-02-20 10:49:46	roushguy	They tend to drink magma/lava

2013-02-20 11:06:20	 *	Malachite is desperately feeding his internet addiction
2013-02-20 11:08:01	GarthAlgar	<AfterShave> What marks a new console generation anyway? <- timing of release, jump in power... i guess?
2013-02-20 11:08:09	roushguy	Malachite, I don't have an internet addiction.
2013-02-20 11:08:18	roushguy	I have an internet /dependency/.
2013-02-20 11:08:27	GarthAlgar	don't we all
2013-02-20 11:08:50	GarthAlgar	it's horrible to be offline for extended periods, so many things you take for granted suddenly vanish
2013-02-20 11:08:57	Malachite	well, im about to get disconnected for about 4 months
2013-02-20 11:09:01	Malachite	so its an addiction
2013-02-20 11:09:07	roushguy	...
2013-02-20 11:09:07	roushguy	WHY
2013-02-20 11:09:14	roushguy	Don't you have a local library?
2013-02-20 11:09:21	GarthAlgar	damn, i had to suffer through a bunch of weeks and it was horrible
2013-02-20 11:09:26	Malachite	im in the navy
2013-02-20 11:09:28	GarthAlgar	4 months would most likely kill me
2013-02-20 11:09:29	AfterShave	Sooo, wasn't the WiiU a jump in power from the Wii, thus marking the generation?
2013-02-20 11:09:38	GarthAlgar	oh, the being in the navy part would kill me too
2013-02-20 11:09:38	roushguy	Oh.
2013-02-20 11:09:39	roushguy	:I
2013-02-20 11:09:51	roushguy	That's why I'm not in the Armed Forces.
2013-02-20 11:10:04	roushguy	I'm not dumb enough to get euchred into losing my vices.
2013-02-20 11:10:17	Malachite	eh
2013-02-20 11:10:26	Malachite	its been worth it
2013-02-20 11:10:33	GarthAlgar	AfterShave: but it only caught up with ps360 in many ways
2013-02-20 11:10:35	Malachite	but the lack of internet is frustrating

2013-02-20 11:10:56	GarthAlgar	it's a bit weird tbh, i am not sure how to count this^^
2013-02-20 11:11:07	roushguy	Okay so
2013-02-20 11:11:14	roushguy	GarthAlgar, you any good at creature modding
2013-02-20 11:11:15	roushguy	?
2013-02-20 11:11:25	AfterShave	Still a jump in power from their first console. I mean, the Wii is in the same generation as the PS3 despite lesser processing capabilites and such
2013-02-20 11:11:35	GarthAlgar	haha, most likely not, but i've never tried
2013-02-20 11:11:47	roushguy	Hmm.

2013-02-20 11:12:20	GarthAlgar	console generations aren't counted per company, though... you can have your first console and be in generation... 7? 8? where are we anyway?
2013-02-20 11:12:24	Malachite	roushguy: you've already frightened me with this idea and i havent even heard it at all
2013-02-20 11:12:36	roushguy	Malachite, basically a new dragon
2013-02-20 11:12:47	roushguy	It needs heat to survive, and it drinks magma to do so
2013-02-20 11:12:57	Malachite	GarthAlgar: thats not really how it works. you usually only hear "last-gen" "current-gen" and "next-gen"
2013-02-20 11:13:07	roushguy	This leaves it with an overabundance of metals in its system, which it exudes as a sort of sweat, forming scales
2013-02-20 11:13:33	Malachite	roushguy: that wouldnt be too hard assuming you could get creatures to drink lava without affecting everyone.
2013-02-20 11:13:46	roushguy	Hmm...
2013-02-20 11:13:51	GarthAlgar	i hear numbered generations all the time :o
2013-02-20 11:13:59	roushguy	I suppose it doesn't have to /drink/ it so much as prefer to be near/in it.
2013-02-20 11:14:15	roushguy	They need to breathe though, so they can't just stay under magma.
2013-02-20 11:14:27	roushguy	But the second part is also strange
2013-02-20 11:14:32	roushguy	I need them to breathe out heat.
2013-02-20 11:14:48	roushguy	Literally expel a superheated blast of air.
2013-02-20 11:15:12	Malachite	thats not that hard i dont think
2013-02-20 11:15:34	Malachite	im not a good modder though, so i couldnt help you
2013-02-20 11:16:01	Malachite	might be a little laggy considering its going to have to generate hot air
2013-02-20 11:16:15	AfterShave	I think making the hometherm(?) could be called breathing out the hot air
2013-02-20 11:16:22	AfterShave	Since it'd be hot

2013-02-20 11:17:12	Kidiri	Was she photoshopped in or not?
2013-02-20 11:17:30	AfterShave	Looks a bit brown around her
2013-02-20 11:17:53	AfterShave	I'd say she looks shopped

2013-02-20 11:18:34	roushguy	Shopped

2013-02-20 11:18:47	roushguy	LOL
2013-02-20 11:18:54	roushguy	If number of games was all that mattered
2013-02-20 11:19:11	roushguy	We'd have a shitton more because companies would change patches to mean entirely new games
2013-02-20 11:19:59	Malachite	heh
2013-02-20 11:22:26	roushguy	Plus those 130k games are probably closer to 600 or so original ideas and a boatload of clones.

2013-02-20 11:27:20	GarthAlgar	i definitely would worry about people being happy to play super shallow iOS games, but the number? what
2013-02-20 11:29:35	roushguy	That's like saying Notch should be worried that he has more trophies than staff.
2013-02-20 11:29:35	roushguy	lol
2013-02-20 11:32:00	roushguy	Or that Toady should be worried DF isn't as big in memory size as a current-gen game.
2013-02-20 11:32:12	roushguy	It's just ludicrous.

2013-02-20 11:43:05	roushguy	If there's any way I could like
2013-02-20 11:43:14	roushguy	Make them 'eat' certain things
2013-02-20 11:43:24	roushguy	Like metallic ore
2013-02-20 11:43:34	roushguy	So their scales grow faster or some such

2013-02-20 11:46:48	roushguy	Why, Malachite?
2013-02-20 11:46:50	roushguy	>:D
2013-02-20 11:49:17	namad8	actually number of games does matter and companies did just call patches games
2013-02-20 11:49:23	namad8	steam used to list any new game on their main page
2013-02-20 11:49:32	namad8	so companies would split patches and dlc and such up and release one a week
2013-02-20 11:49:36	namad8	to stay on the new games list for a year at a time
2013-02-20 11:49:48	namad8	until steam finally after a year or two wised up and now moved dlc to another section
2013-02-20 11:50:06	namad8	magic the gathering duels of the planeswalkers and train emualtor the training were someof the worst offenders
2013-02-20 11:50:30	namad8	so it's possible to make # of things listed superficially matter in a dumb way that then vastly inflates the number
2013-02-20 11:50:46	namad8	a lot of apple's app store business plan is downright/evil/illegal
2013-02-20 11:50:56	roushguy	Yeah
2013-02-20 11:50:57	namad8	doing stuff like selling free kids or pets games with in game purchases of like 1000$
2013-02-20 11:51:03	namad8	to try to just flat out rob people
2013-02-20 11:51:07	roushguy	But because it's Apple.
2013-02-20 11:51:08	roushguy	It's okay.
2013-02-20 11:51:55	namad8	apple is just evil through and through basically all their products suck they've just got great marketing spin, i've hated apple ever since they did a bunch of evil stuff like a decade ago much of which they've reverted
2013-02-20 11:52:04	roushguy	A perfect example, here.

2013-02-20 11:52:50	roushguy	I hate the fact that people buy crapple tech that falls apart in about three goddamn days.
2013-02-20 11:52:58	roushguy	Here's a true story
2013-02-20 11:53:09	roushguy	Was with an acquaintance, and a friend
2013-02-20 11:53:17	namad8	the thing i hate most of all is that they are basically just flat out criminals and liars
2013-02-20 11:53:23	namad8	a lot of my friends flat out tell me this
2013-02-20 11:53:25	roushguy	My friend's friend, the acquaintance, was buying an iPhone
2013-02-20 11:53:28	namad8	i ask them why they want or have an apple computer
2013-02-20 11:53:31	namad8	they tell me that apple makes better computers
2013-02-20 11:53:33	namad8	i ask them better how
2013-02-20 11:53:40	roushguy	They purchased the damnable thing, then dropped it IN THE STORE.
2013-02-20 11:53:46	namad8	eventually they just explain that clearly since they cost twice as much they must be luxuary elite computers
2013-02-20 11:53:56	roushguy	Called Apple because the store's policy doesn't cover it
2013-02-20 11:54:05	namad8	i try to explain to them that apple computers are not better in any measurable way they're just different and a lot of the cost comes from marketing costs
2013-02-20 11:54:07	roushguy	Apple says that is not included under warranty, they must buy new phone.
2013-02-20 11:54:14	namad8	they won't believe it, and we never speak of technical matters again
2013-02-20 11:54:19	roushguy	lol
2013-02-20 11:54:22	roushguy	Show them the guts
2013-02-20 11:54:23	roushguy	Hell
2013-02-20 11:54:29	roushguy	Buy a crapplebook
2013-02-20 11:54:36	roushguy	Then rip it apart for the guts
2013-02-20 11:54:42	roushguy	And also a normal laptop
2013-02-20 11:54:45	roushguy	Rip it apart for the guts
2013-02-20 11:54:46	sandbox	"selling free kids" ;p
2013-02-20 11:54:49	roushguy	Explain
2013-02-20 11:55:09	namad8	roushguy that doesn't mean much at all... the guts of a car look much the same to the untrained eye regardless of it it's better or worse than another one
2013-02-20 11:55:15	roushguy	well
2013-02-20 11:55:19	roushguy	You show them the numbers
2013-02-20 11:55:23	namad8	the main reason people own apple computers is to be thought of as hip by other idiots who see them holding it
2013-02-20 11:55:28	roushguy	urgh, I know.
2013-02-20 11:55:39	roushguy	I will allow Apple one thing however.
2013-02-20 11:55:44	namad8	but the bad part is that people go around thinking that apple computers are bmw's
2013-02-20 11:55:49	namad8	and that regular computers are kia's
2013-02-20 11:55:58	roushguy	Their PCs are surprisingly stable, and extremely acceptable for a professional workstation.
2013-02-20 11:56:01	namad8	a bmw might be a bit overpriced but it also has some quality parts too
2013-02-20 11:56:04	roushguy	ER
2013-02-20 11:56:06	roushguy	Desktops
2013-02-20 11:56:07	roushguy	not PC
2013-02-20 11:56:15	GarthAlgar	the only decent apple branded stuff seems to be their monitors
2013-02-20 11:56:20	roushguy	Naw
2013-02-20 11:56:25	roushguy	Apple's desktops are good for like
2013-02-20 11:56:31	namad8	no they aren't
2013-02-20 11:56:35	roushguy	Musicians.
2013-02-20 11:56:45	namad8	that's just more of the lies
2013-02-20 11:56:48	roushguy	Or other art-based professionals.
2013-02-20 11:56:50	roushguy	Uhh...
2013-02-20 11:56:53	GarthAlgar	which part?
2013-02-20 11:56:55	namad8	they're just too overpriced to be good at just about anything
2013-02-20 11:57:06	roushguy	I have a friend who's a professional.
2013-02-20 11:57:07	roushguy	:I
2013-02-20 11:57:09	namad8	because for whatever amount of money you can just invest in something that's cheaper and then upgrade it to be better
2013-02-20 11:57:18	roushguy	She makes, mixes, and masters music.
2013-02-20 11:57:34	roushguy	And none of the programs which are top-of-the-line are made for Windows.
2013-02-20 11:57:55	namad8	i've heard people say this sort of stuff to me before
2013-02-20 11:57:56	@smeding	that uh
2013-02-20 11:57:58	@smeding	used to be the case like

2013-02-20 11:58:01	namad8	but i've lived with someone like that
2013-02-20 11:58:05	namad8	and it's just false
2013-02-20 11:58:07	roushguy	There is a very, very small group of people who benefit from Apple tech.
2013-02-20 11:58:07	namad8	they just believe it
2013-02-20 11:58:11	@smeding	macs are pretty much PCs now
2013-02-20 11:58:18	@smeding	with different squigglies on the screen
2013-02-20 11:58:24	namad8	like that was true at one point like smeding says
2013-02-20 11:58:32	roushguy	lol
2013-02-20 11:58:32	namad8	and it's possible that the mac is better for a given user just because they're used to it
2013-02-20 11:58:41	roushguy	She's using an eight-year-old Apple comp
2013-02-20 11:58:45	namad8	but none of the facts people use to claim macs are superior are ever correct anymore
2013-02-20 11:58:49	namad8	it's the whole giant lie thing
2013-02-20 11:58:49	roushguy	So that might be why
2013-02-20 11:58:53	@smeding	roushguy: then that's by no means 'top of the line'
2013-02-20 11:58:58	namad8	that 8year old apple computer probably cost like 2000$
2013-02-20 11:59:02	roushguy	The programs are 'top of the line'
2013-02-20 11:59:13	roushguy	IE what other professionals use
2013-02-20 11:59:14	namad8	and if she had bought regular pc's for 600$ she could've upgraded twice since then and had a screaming fast 2or3 year old computer right now :-p
2013-02-20 11:59:20	roushguy	I'd have to ask her for more info
2013-02-20 11:59:34	roushguy	But I agree
2013-02-20 11:59:36	roushguy	Apple sucks.
2013-02-20 11:59:37	namad8	being a professionaly doesn't mean you can't fall victim to a lie created by a billionare
2013-02-20 11:59:51	namad8	i mean she's used to those programs, so that work best for her
2013-02-20 12:00:23	sandbox	it's a pity that steve jobs was never caught snorting cocaine, I can just imagine the headlines
2013-02-20 12:00:24	namad8	but if you took some like new kid who doesn't know jack and two alternate realities where he uses her viewpoint or the anti-apple viewpoint he's gonna find in a decade or two he disagrees with his alternate reality self :)
2013-02-20 12:00:39	namad8	steve jobs doesn't believe in liscense plates or paying parking tickets
2013-02-20 12:00:52	namad8	he's an asshole 100% no being caught doing anything would've mattered
2013-02-20 12:00:57	roushguy	Steve Jobs doesn't believe in laws.
2013-02-20 12:01:02	namad8	although the legal issues surrounding parking tickets are kind of messed up
2013-02-20 12:01:13	namad8	i've actually received quite a few fraudulent parking tickets from incompetent meter maids
2013-02-20 12:01:16	@smeding	steve jobs doesn't believe in license plates because he's dead bro
2013-02-20 12:01:20	namad8	accusing me of parking in a loading zone in front of my house
2013-02-20 12:01:32	namad8	on a street where there is a loading zone a block away across the street diagonally
2013-02-20 12:01:50	namad8	you go to contest a ticket they offer you half off, or go to full court and risk paying 10times in legal fees
2013-02-20 12:01:56	namad8	it's basically illegal shakedown
2013-02-20 12:01:56	@smeding	anyway the thing about software is
2013-02-20 12:01:58	@smeding	everything sucks
2013-02-20 12:02:06	roushguy	Except Windows.
2013-02-20 12:02:11	namad8	also steve jobs didn't believe in parking tickets or liscense plates before he died
2013-02-20 12:02:11	@smeding	even windows
2013-02-20 12:02:15	@smeding	computers suck
2013-02-20 12:02:19	namad8	i'm surprised cops weren't just constantly going around arresting him
2013-02-20 12:02:20	roushguy	LIES
2013-02-20 12:02:36	namad8	aye, everything sucks, so at least don't overpay :)
2013-02-20 12:02:38	roushguy	Oh look
2013-02-20 12:02:40	roushguy	http://macromeme.com/dog/chemistry-shirt.html
2013-02-20 12:02:48	roushguy	That could be DF humor
2013-02-20 12:03:51	uristmchambel	a new archive of thepiratebay is up.  please dl and seed
2013-02-20 12:03:52	uristmchambel	http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8163015
2013-02-20 12:04:00	@smeding	no
2013-02-20 12:04:06	namad8	there's no need to have so many archives of the thing
2013-02-20 12:04:12	GarthAlgar	the one thing audio-related i heard several times: you have less latency on a mac than on windows
2013-02-20 12:04:21	namad8	it's not so amazingly useful that there need to be 10283100 backups of it
2013-02-20 12:04:25	namad8	72backups is prolly plenty :-p
2013-02-20 12:04:34	namad8	furthermore even if it goes down there are competitors
2013-02-20 12:04:47	PhoebosLC	It's a huge offline archive of magnet links
2013-02-20 12:04:48	namad8	also that archive is missing a lot of fairly useful peices
2013-02-20 12:04:48	@smeding	it's also technically against the rules we once had here
2013-02-20 12:04:57	PhoebosLC	smeding: No it is not
2013-02-20 12:04:58	namad8	like it doesn't include the torrent files of rare torrents or comments
2013-02-20 12:04:58	@smeding	and it's also dumb and i hate it
2013-02-20 12:05:04	PhoebosLC	It's an archive of magnet links
2013-02-20 12:05:06	@smeding	PhoebosLC: it really is
2013-02-20 12:05:09	PhoebosLC	Magnet links are not illegal.
2013-02-20 12:05:13	@smeding	and i would like to point out that i have an @ in front of my nick
2013-02-20 12:05:17	namad8	yes they are
2013-02-20 12:05:18	@smeding	and you are arguing with me
2013-02-20 12:05:25	namad8	in that discussing how to pirate something is against the rules of this channel
2013-02-20 12:05:25	PhoebosLC	Congratulations, that does not make you automatically right
2013-02-20 12:05:34	PhoebosLC	>how to pirate something
2013-02-20 12:05:35	PhoebosLC	oh boy
2013-02-20 12:05:36	namad8	he's 100% right on that matter
2013-02-20 12:05:39	PhoebosLC	pulling out
2013-02-20 12:05:45	namad8	furthermore he's allowed to make up rules if he wants
2013-02-20 12:05:49	@smeding	i don't feel like this shit so
2013-02-20 12:05:52	@smeding	you have ten seconds
2013-02-20 12:06:16	PhoebosLC	to what, drop my weapon?
2013-02-20 12:06:30	PhoebosLC	are you a robot
2013-02-20 12:06:38	<--	smeding has kicked PhoebosLC (you were 15 seconds late)
2013-02-20 12:06:58	roushguy	What is fitocracy?
2013-02-20 12:07:15	@smeding	a place for nerds to pretend exercise is a video game
2013-02-20 12:07:17	namad8	i think mentioning that piracy exists is prolly okay but actually linking to a website that a person can go to and help them aquire pirated materials was against this channel as of like many many years ago, before the channel started falling apart and actually had lot sof mods and moderation
2013-02-20 12:07:49	@smeding	the reason it's fallen apart is because the people who kept this community together mostly found better places to talk
2013-02-20 12:08:00	@smeding	i'm p sure
2013-02-20 12:08:20	@smeding	only reason i'm still here is because of some leftover feelings of responsibility really
2013-02-20 12:09:56	roushguy	Hmm...
2013-02-20 12:10:06	roushguy	Where would be a 'better place to talk'?
2013-02-20 12:10:07	roushguy	:I
2013-02-20 12:10:12	roushguy	IRC is pretty useful
2013-02-20 12:10:17	uristmchambel	my b i didn't know there were rules
2013-02-20 12:10:17	@smeding	other places on IRC
2013-02-20 12:10:18	Kidiri	My pants.
2013-02-20 12:10:29	roushguy	Oh.
2013-02-20 12:10:29	namad8	we discuss so many general topics here now and so little bay12 that whatever you wish to talk about here probably has an irc elsewhere more apropriate to it
2013-02-20 12:10:29	@smeding	uristmchambel: it's fine, that's why i didn't kick you
2013-02-20 12:10:45	roushguy	Well, I want to talk about DF and LCS here.
2013-02-20 12:10:46	@smeding	namad8: well, to be fair, IRC channels are usually less about a topic and more about a community
2013-02-20 12:10:57	@smeding	and people have started talking about DF again more recently
2013-02-20 12:10:59	Kidiri	They can be summed up to: Don't be a dick, don't do anything illegal.
2013-02-20 12:11:01	@smeding	what with some new faces and stuff
2013-02-20 12:11:04	roushguy	My only other real interest is MLP, and I have... six channels open for it.
2013-02-20 12:11:05	namad8	a little of column b and a little of column a
2013-02-20 12:11:18	namad8	i do recall a few years back though this channel had constant spam and discussion all day every day
2013-02-20 12:11:23	namad8	2or3 years ago or something maybe 4
2013-02-20 12:11:27	@smeding	Kidiri: they can be better summed up by 'fuck you' really
2013-02-20 12:11:29	namad8	lately there are times when no one speaks for 8hours or more
2013-02-20 12:11:43	roushguy	I remember when G-Flex had to rename himself something else
2013-02-20 12:11:47	roushguy	But I don't remember why
2013-02-20 12:11:51	Kidiri	Is that you plural or singular?
2013-02-20 12:11:52	@smeding	it's fine this way, most channels are like that
2013-02-20 12:12:00	@smeding	Kidiri: why can't it be both
2013-02-20 12:12:00	RPharazon|NB	smeding is a strong believer in the "fuck you" school of moderation
2013-02-20 12:12:03	namad8	at one point this was actually an officially supported toady df channel and toadycame here a few times, so it made sense we had rules
2013-02-20 12:12:09	namad8	then he was so ashamed of us he disowned us
2013-02-20 12:12:10	RPharazon|NB	This place is better for it really
2013-02-20 12:12:24	roushguy	So
2013-02-20 12:12:28	uristmchambel	I like this channel.  It is kind of just my chill background irc
2013-02-20 12:12:34	uristmchambel	not my home, but still homey
2013-02-20 12:12:39	Kidiri	Because I want to know whether you want only me to fuck off
2013-02-20 12:12:41	roushguy	Anyone have ideas on how to create something that sweats scales?
2013-02-20 12:12:41	Kidiri	Or everybody.
2013-02-20 12:13:08	RPharazon|NB	This channel is the only one that I haven't got tired of/has kicked me out so far
2013-02-20 12:13:11	RPharazon|NB	It's great
2013-02-20 12:13:18	sandbox	found this purely coincidentally http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/3815183_700b.jpg
2013-02-20 12:13:20	@smeding	namad8: yeah there's not really rules anymore but i mean if i give a hint that i'd rather not have you talk about some shit
2013-02-20 12:13:22	uristmchambel	reddit is bullshit.  the irc
2013-02-20 12:13:38	sandbox	Toady is ashamed of everything
2013-02-20 12:13:41	@smeding	namad8: and then you continue to be an idiot about it, and i'm in a bad mood, then you get what's coming to you
2013-02-20 12:14:03	-->	Panda_ (~Moimeme@NewNet-50C1D59C.fbx.proxad.net) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-20 12:14:08	uristmchambel	the admin of the subreddit irc is a crooked cop irl
2013-02-20 12:14:08	Kidiri	smeding in a bad mood
2013-02-20 12:14:09	roushguy	Kidiri, do you have any ideas?
2013-02-20 12:14:11	Kidiri	You mean, smeding?
2013-02-20 12:14:20	Kidiri	roushguy, what about?
2013-02-20 12:14:26	sandbox	he comes across one little fight on the forums and he gets scared
2013-02-20 12:14:29	@smeding	Kidiri: you ⊆ everyone
2013-02-20 12:14:45	roushguy	How to create a creature that 'sweats' scales
2013-02-20 12:14:52	namad8	speaking of actually fucking talking about games in here for once, what should i play?
2013-02-20 12:14:54	Kidiri	Yes, but I'd think there'd be certain people you'd not want to fuck off.
2013-02-20 12:14:55	roushguy	IE its scales get steadily thicker while it lives
2013-02-20 12:14:58	uristmchambel	I'm thinking about making a TOR irc
2013-02-20 12:15:00	namad8	impire really let me down and i just have no idea what to play lately
2013-02-20 12:15:00	@smeding	sandbox: and then Threetoe says you're moving with your auntie and uncle in bel air
2013-02-20 12:15:01	Kidiri	No idea, roushguy.
2013-02-20 12:15:04	roushguy	namad8, why not play LCS?
2013-02-20 12:15:09	@smeding	uristmchambel: pretty sure there's tor IRC channels
2013-02-20 12:15:13	Kidiri	I haven't tried modding in the newest DF.
2013-02-20 12:15:15	namad8	the release of the 3ds really screwd me over because i played so many new nds releases on desmume
2013-02-20 12:15:17	@smeding	uristmchambel: also pretty sure that only scumbags use tor
2013-02-20 12:15:18	uristmchambel	smeding yeah might make my own
2013-02-20 12:15:29	uristmchambel	smeding or libertarians
2013-02-20 12:15:30	namad8	i've played lcs before and df not a lot new with them lately really to make me dive back in really
2013-02-20 12:15:46	@smeding	uristmchambel: libertarians are a subset of that group
2013-02-20 12:15:46	roushguy	Hmm.
2013-02-20 12:16:29	namad8	i need some new game to play that i haven't already played either due to obscurity or newness
2013-02-20 12:16:29	uristmchambel	haha
2013-02-20 12:16:29	roushguy	namad8, do you like MUDs?
2013-02-20 12:16:29	namad8	and i'm sorted burned out on path of exile and blood bowl and whatever
2013-02-20 12:16:29	namad8	i subscribed to dragonrealms back in the day
2013-02-20 12:16:29	uristmchambel	All of your personalities are blended together in my brain.  I don't know who is who.
2013-02-20 12:16:29	namad8	and i wrote intenlligent trainer scripts that would move around do various activities try to keep as many skills training at once as possible
2013-02-20 12:16:29	roushguy	namad8, I suggest Geas
2013-02-20 12:16:34	RPharazon|NB	The only people who use TOR are idiots, scumbags, pedophiles, and kids who want to masturbate over how they totally found the deepweb
2013-02-20 12:16:38	roushguy	It's RP-enforced though
2013-02-20 12:16:40	namad8	but i dont know if i'd really like any modern muds
2013-02-20 12:16:43	roushguy	It's pretty good.
2013-02-20 12:16:50	uristmchambel	RPharazon|NB or drugs
2013-02-20 12:16:53	uristmchambel	good drugs
2013-02-20 12:16:54	@smeding	only dude i know who uses tor is a convicted computer hacker
2013-02-20 12:17:03	uristmchambel	TOR is awesome
2013-02-20 12:17:04	@smeding	true story
2013-02-20 12:17:14	roushguy	I know a RL hacker.
2013-02-20 12:17:16	namad8	seriously what are the major games of 2013?
2013-02-20 12:17:20	namad8	i guess this happens every year doesn't it?
2013-02-20 12:17:22	roushguy	He's never been convicted but he did do it.
2013-02-20 12:17:35	Kidiri	How should we know, namad8?
2013-02-20 12:17:37	RPharazon|NB	smeding would he not fall under the scumbag category
2013-02-20 12:17:37	namad8	there's nothing to fucking play in januarey or february because all the publishers rush all games in development out for xmas
2013-02-20 12:17:45	Kidiri	It's hardly been two months.
2013-02-20 12:17:45	RPharazon|NB	Or possibly the idiot category seeing as how he got convicted
2013-02-20 12:17:48	namad8	well have any of you been playing anything lately that came out in 2013?
2013-02-20 12:17:55	@smeding	RPharazon|NB: nah he's cool
2013-02-20 12:18:03	sandbox	namad8: look at what's happened with Rayman
2013-02-20 12:18:11	RPharazon|NB	A new category then
2013-02-20 12:18:14	RPharazon|NB	Friends of smeding
2013-02-20 12:18:17	uristmchambel	the shallownet is only 10% of the total internet
2013-02-20 12:18:20	uristmchambel	why not explore the rest?
2013-02-20 12:18:22	@smeding	RPharazon|NB: he was arrested for the paypal ddos when he was 16
2013-02-20 12:18:23	namad8	2months should be plenty of time for something to come out, really now with low costs of games and digitial distribution does xmas really have to matter so much? come on publishers spread out the releases
2013-02-20 12:18:34	RPharazon|NB	Who would want to ddos paypal
2013-02-20 12:18:34	sandbox	indeed
2013-02-20 12:18:40	RPharazon|NB	Their servers die all the time anyways
2013-02-20 12:18:46	namad8	paypal is kind of evil
2013-02-20 12:18:46	RPharazon|NB	It's like kicking a cancerous dog
2013-02-20 12:18:57	uristmchambel	paypal is horrible
2013-02-20 12:18:57	namad8	they're like we're a bank but we don't have any of the responsbilities of a bank just all the privledges
2013-02-20 12:19:06	uristmchambel	they cut service of "questionable" sites
2013-02-20 12:19:17	RPharazon|NB	Which is why you never drop more than like $30 into your account
2013-02-20 12:19:35	namad8	paypal misrepresents itself a good bit
2013-02-20 12:19:43	namad8	it's somewhat dishonest and irresponsible of a company imo
2013-02-20 12:19:55	uristmchambel	I only use paypal to get free loans.  I pay with it and it takes a few days for it to take the $ from my bank account
2013-02-20 12:20:00	@smeding	i have my bank account hooked up but if they try to steal my money, joke's on them
2013-02-20 12:20:04	@smeding	i don't have any
2013-02-20 12:20:14	<--	BoogtehWoog (~IceChat77@NewNet-70A8B2DA.dhcp.jcsn.tn.charter.com) has quit (Ping timeout)
2013-02-20 12:20:15	RPharazon|NB	Right on
2013-02-20 12:20:17	namad8	if a business man has a bank account at a real bank, and his competitor wants him out of business they can't just write a letter to the bank and say please take away all his money
2013-02-20 12:20:43	namad8	paypal's small claims department is the worst tho
2013-02-20 12:20:53	namad8	anytime there's a dispute everyone involved is just screwd over and paypal robs them
2013-02-20 12:20:57	uristmchambel	downloading black mesa
2013-02-20 12:21:01	Commondragon	Paypal was actually nice to me
2013-02-20 12:21:09	Commondragon	When my father used my paypal to sign up for an obvious scam
2013-02-20 12:21:19	Commondragon	And I was stupid enough to let him
2013-02-20 12:21:36	roushguy	lol
2013-02-20 12:21:55	roushguy	I remember the day my mom first got spam mail
2013-02-20 12:21:58	Commondragon	"Oh hey, it turns out they're fucking liars and trying to take money again.  We'll just put a stop to that" and thats the last I heard of it
2013-02-20 12:22:05	roushguy	She was all excited about one of those Nigerian Prince scams
2013-02-20 12:22:08	Commondragon	I remember the day my mother first got spam
2013-02-20 12:22:11	RPharazon|NB	I have yet to download and play Black Mesa because it has yet to be available for download at a place that doesn't bombard you with ads, mandatory logins, and 5kb/s download speeds
2013-02-20 12:22:19	Commondragon	It was 1000 emails because she's like me and checks once a month
2013-02-20 12:22:28	uristmchambel	lol i am getting it through forbidden means
2013-02-20 12:22:35	Commondragon	She immediately blamed it on my father since he was the last person on the laptop
2013-02-20 12:22:47	roushguy	oh
2013-02-20 12:22:47	roushguy	Man
2013-02-20 12:23:03	roushguy	That's almost as good as me getting my computer privileges revoked at school for 'hacking'
2013-02-20 12:23:07	roushguy	I was playing a MUD
2013-02-20 12:23:22	uristmchambel	does this host support SSL? if so what port
2013-02-20 12:23:23	namad8	well i suppose to be fair playing a mud in class is probably against the rules too
2013-02-20 12:23:33	roushguy	I wasn't in class
2013-02-20 12:23:42	roushguy	I was in an off-period, in the library.
2013-02-20 12:23:53	sandbox	I don't remember anyone getting found out when looking up porn in school
2013-02-20 12:23:56	roushguy	Kid next to me was looking at porn
2013-02-20 12:24:01	roushguy	But I get in trouble for using a MUD
2013-02-20 12:24:06	namad8	well if it's high school we dont get off periods here in those, and if it was college i dont think they really have that right
2013-02-20 12:24:15	RPharazon|NB	MUDs lead you into satanism
2013-02-20 12:24:20	roushguy	Bullshit.
2013-02-20 12:24:29	namad8	well did you ever get your privledges back
2013-02-20 12:24:36	Malachite	hey
2013-02-20 12:24:38	Malachite	muds are awesome
2013-02-20 12:24:39	GarthAlgar	satanism leads to MUDs
2013-02-20 12:24:46	namad8	i've mutli-boxed muds and mmos in school labs before, lol
2013-02-20 12:24:47	uristmchambel	MUDS lead to scuds
2013-02-20 12:24:49	roushguy	Yeah, after I showed the dumbfuck computer administrator she couldn't touch me
2013-02-20 12:24:51	GarthAlgar	oh god
2013-02-20 12:24:52	sandbox	using the school network for playing doom was great
2013-02-20 12:24:54	namad8	to be fair i always did it in a closed down lab tho where i was sure to be alone
2013-02-20 12:25:07	roushguy	Well, namad8
2013-02-20 12:25:12	<--	xorp (~water@NewNet-FF5FDA11.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has quit (Broken pipe)
2013-02-20 12:25:13	roushguy	I told her if she wanted hacking, she'd get it
2013-02-20 12:25:24	roushguy	So I took to unplugging the ethernet cable from my comp in class
2013-02-20 12:25:27	RPharazon|NB	No you didn't
2013-02-20 12:25:30	namad8	although really the worst you should get for that, is just kicked out that night so they can close it down or save it for scholasitic purposes
2013-02-20 12:25:32	Malachite	my schools computer admin approved of me completely breaking their security to play portable Half life
2013-02-20 12:25:33	RPharazon|NB	You quietly and timidly followed orders
2013-02-20 12:25:43	RPharazon|NB	Then you made up stories to impress random retards on the internet
2013-02-20 12:25:45	roushguy	And I'd sit there and laugh to myself after my game loaded up.
2013-02-20 12:25:46	namad8	threatening them prolly wasn't wise
2013-02-20 12:25:51	roushguy	RPharazon, you don't know me do you
2013-02-20 12:25:59	RPharazon|NB	I know nobody
2013-02-20 12:26:02	roushguy	I'm too lazy to follow orders from teachers.
2013-02-20 12:26:08	sandbox	showing my age here ;p
2013-02-20 12:26:08	namad8	like they'd have backed down easily if you'd have been reasonable
2013-02-20 12:26:21	namad8	also how does unplugging yourself from the internet help you play an online game
2013-02-20 12:26:35	uristmchambel	namad8 protects you from overseer software
2013-02-20 12:26:37	roushguy	Man
2013-02-20 12:26:42	roushguy	^
2013-02-20 12:26:46	roushguy	I'd go to the site
2013-02-20 12:26:53	roushguy	Let my game load, and disconnect
2013-02-20 12:27:02	namad8	are you trolling?
2013-02-20 12:27:10	roushguy	Nope.
2013-02-20 12:27:19	namad8	if that's literally what you did, you weren't playing a mud you were playing a flash game or something :-p
2013-02-20 12:27:24	sandbox	some of the younger kids looked up the spice girls when they were just starting up
2013-02-20 12:27:31	roushguy	I was playing a MUD when I got in trouble
2013-02-20 12:27:35	namad8	a mud only functions with a constant internet connection because it's a multiplayer game...
2013-02-20 12:27:38	roushguy	After that I started playing flash games
2013-02-20 12:27:41	uristmchambel	I feel stupid.  I've never heard of a MUD
2013-02-20 12:27:44	namad8	oh i see
2013-02-20 12:27:44	roushguy	Uhhh
2013-02-20 12:27:49	namad8	MUD is just what mmo's were in the 80s and 90s
2013-02-20 12:27:51	roushguy	uristmchambel, if you play DF with ASCII
2013-02-20 12:27:52	namad8	multi-user-dungeons?
2013-02-20 12:27:54	roushguy	You canplay a MUD
2013-02-20 12:27:55	roushguy	xD
2013-02-20 12:28:01	namad8	this is how you'd play
2013-02-20 12:28:03	namad8	look
2013-02-20 12:28:03	uristmchambel	ah ok.  I've never liked mmos
2013-02-20 12:28:06	namad8	look w
2013-02-20 12:28:08	namad8	w
2013-02-20 12:28:11	namad8	e
2013-02-20 12:28:16	Malachite	kill namad8
2013-02-20 12:28:16	namad8	look w
2013-02-20 12:28:25	namad8	open leather backpack
2013-02-20 12:28:37	uristmchambel	this is interesting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_MUDs
2013-02-20 12:28:38	roushguy	Pic of me
2013-02-20 12:28:39	roushguy	http://i.imgur.com/CX0b8QB.jpg
2013-02-20 12:29:15	Malachite	i was really heavy into the battletech muxes when they were active
2013-02-20 12:29:20	uristmchambel	roushguy you look like you could pull off plugs
2013-02-20 12:29:23	namad8	this was the only mud i ever took super seriously http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonRealms
2013-02-20 12:29:25	roushguy	Plugs?
2013-02-20 12:29:28	Malachite	died out hard about 4 years ago
2013-02-20 12:29:34	roushguy	BATTLETECH
2013-02-20 12:29:35	namad8	the fact you had to pay to play led to a higher level of player involvement and better rp enforcement and such
2013-02-20 12:30:07	uristmchambel	sorry that is what we call gauges around here
2013-02-20 12:30:16	uristmchambel	I don't like them much but they would look good on you
2013-02-20 12:30:17	namad8	i always dicked around like a noob idiot in free muds but just never really got dragged in so many of them were empty and involved no real interactions because there were more muds than players of muds
2013-02-20 12:30:22	Malachite	roushguy: as a mux; they were amazing
2013-02-20 12:30:23	namad8	imagine a world with 10,000 players and 100,000 mmos lol
2013-02-20 12:30:33	roushguy	Oh gawd no
2013-02-20 12:30:42	uristmchambel	I'm serous
2013-02-20 12:30:43	roushguy	I would NEVER fuck up my ears like that
2013-02-20 12:30:46	uristmchambel	haha
2013-02-20 12:30:48	uristmchambel	good idea
2013-02-20 12:30:49	uristmchambel	just sayin
2013-02-20 12:30:56	BlackGyver_	he's SEROUS
2013-02-20 12:30:59	BlackGyver_	he means it
2013-02-20 12:31:00	namad8	actually wait no there was another mud i loved to death and was free
2013-02-20 12:31:18	namad8	it had a special client you had to run it in that was heavily blue but not that critical to the actual game and was still just basic telnet style for the most part
2013-02-20 12:31:20	uristmchambel	was whats his face permabanned?
2013-02-20 12:31:24	namad8	you lived in a cyberpunk dystopia
2013-02-20 12:31:36	namad8	but when you went to sleep you dreamed you were in a dreamworld with medivial mud style rules
2013-02-20 12:31:49	roushguy	O.o
2013-02-20 12:31:51	uristmchambel	I've been playing system shock
2013-02-20 12:31:52	namad8	but bizarre dreamscape transistitions from lizardmen space pirates to climbing a primordial mountain
2013-02-20 12:31:53	roushguy	That's... kinda cool.
2013-02-20 12:31:54	uristmchambel	great game
2013-02-20 12:32:03	roushguy	Anyhow
2013-02-20 12:32:06	namad8	i can't recall the name but the mud died ages ago, wish i could remember the name and/or revive it
2013-02-20 12:32:11	roushguy	What do you think of the beard, uristmchambel?
2013-02-20 12:32:21	uristmchambel	roushguy it fits you
2013-02-20 12:32:35	namad8	in the cyberpunk world you could like go to strip clubs casinos, hack into terminals wear disguises and invent strange mechanical explosives or some such
2013-02-20 12:32:42	namad8	but in the dream you just used swords and chainmail and stuff like that
2013-02-20 12:32:51	uristmchambel	wth
2013-02-20 12:32:54	namad8	one of the coolest parts was each time you dreamed you entered from a random room
2013-02-20 12:33:25	roushguy	So!
2013-02-20 12:33:30	roushguy	How 'bout dem dorfs!
2013-02-20 12:33:36	roushguy	Hey smeding
2013-02-20 12:33:39	uristmchambel	alright I've got to do some work.  see you all later
2013-02-20 12:33:51	roushguy	Do you know if I can make a creature's parts grow at a hyper-accelerated rate/
2013-02-20 12:34:34	namad8	nowadays gaming design is really limited by how expensive and time intensive voice acting and 3d artwork are, i wish the 90s never ended, reading never became unpopular in games, and artists continuned to endlessly refine their 2d spritework to glorious heights
2013-02-20 12:34:49	roushguy	Haha
2013-02-20 12:34:52	roushguy	namad8, in other words
2013-02-20 12:34:56	namad8	but damned if i'm not addicted to the mass effects and skyrims of today and i dont think i can go back and play my childhood favorites anymore
2013-02-20 12:34:59	roushguy	Every game is Dorf Fort
2013-02-20 12:35:01	GarthAlgar	the reading part is mostly a US thing
2013-02-20 12:35:06	namad8	no dort fort is ugly
2013-02-20 12:35:12	@smeding	roushguy: i know nothing about DF modding
2013-02-20 12:35:17	GarthAlgar	there's still japanese games with tons of unvoiced dialogue
2013-02-20 12:35:18	roushguy	Oh
2013-02-20 12:35:23	namad8	like i enjoy the improvements to mouse control and ui design that have advanced since 1990
2013-02-20 12:35:27	namad8	i like using a mouse wheel to zoom
2013-02-20 12:35:30	roushguy	Who here is a decentish modder?
2013-02-20 12:35:42	sandbox	how long before we don't need voice actors?
2013-02-20 12:35:42	namad8	i want beautifl artwork, i just don't want it to be needlessly 3d
2013-02-20 12:35:48	GarthAlgar	too long
2013-02-20 12:35:48	@smeding	roushguy: all i know about DF is like, some vestigial gameplay info and some stuff about the save game file format and shit
2013-02-20 12:35:57	GarthAlgar	i am waiting for that, too
2013-02-20 12:36:07	roushguy	Ah.
2013-02-20 12:36:09	namad8	i want my game to look good, i want my menus to have careful art design behind them so they're clean good looking and groggable
2013-02-20 12:36:19	namad8	i just don't need hair physics and boobjiggling and cape physics
2013-02-20 12:36:52	roushguy	lol
2013-02-20 12:36:58	namad8	so hopefully i'll love wasteland2 and project obsidian's new kickstarter game, but honestly so far from the demo videos of wasteland it looks kind of bad
2013-02-20 12:37:05	GarthAlgar	well, the hair part okay, but boobs? youf iend ;p
2013-02-20 12:37:21	GarthAlgar	i found the wasteland 2 video somewhat unimpressive, too
2013-02-20 12:37:32	GarthAlgar	but i figured that's because i didn't really care about the first one either
2013-02-20 12:37:35	Kidiri	namad8, if you want good menus
2013-02-20 12:37:42	Kidiri	Take some lessons from Toady
2013-02-20 12:37:54	Kidiri	And do the opposite.
2013-02-20 12:38:14	namad8	here's the thing though
2013-02-20 12:38:17	 *	roushguy falls out of his chair
2013-02-20 12:38:32	namad8	i dont much like the real time out of combat system in wasteland2
2013-02-20 12:38:41	namad8	i think it'd be nice if you moved a squadleader icon
2013-02-20 12:38:46	namad8	and in combat you just split off into a group
2013-02-20 12:38:55	namad8	micromanaging the positioning of a squad isn't what those old school rpgs were about
2013-02-20 12:39:08	roushguy	How to win Red Alert
2013-02-20 12:39:10	namad8	that's what new school semi-tactical whatever's are about
2013-02-20 12:39:14	namad8	it feels like a totally different genre
2013-02-20 12:39:14	roushguy	Tanya + tanks
2013-02-20 12:39:18	namad8	it's not a 90s rpg at all anymore
2013-02-20 12:39:23	GarthAlgar	still better than the most likely alternative: full realtime stupidity
2013-02-20 12:39:43	GarthAlgar	and wasteland was released in the 80s, wasn't it?
2013-02-20 12:39:48	namad8	like i feel like getting caught out of position at the start of a fight is going to be way to big of a deal
2013-02-20 12:39:59	namad8	wasteland invented 1990s western non-ultima rpgs tho :)
2013-02-20 12:40:05	namad8	even tho it was an 80s game
2013-02-20 12:40:15	namad8	wasteland basically invented black isle
2013-02-20 12:41:07	namad8	it doesnt look that bad a bit like lionheart's real time-ish-ness i guess although that was a horrible failure of an rpg
2013-02-20 12:41:08	sandbox	I've been to black isle
2013-02-20 12:41:19	namad8	although i believe mostly just due to pacing and balance issues? not design
2013-02-20 12:41:33	namad8	basically i just wish troika never died
2013-02-20 12:41:40	namad8	and gaming development continued along the lines of arcanum
2013-02-20 12:41:54	namad8	and 2d sprites got higher and higher resolution and looked better and better
2013-02-20 12:41:59	GarthAlgar	i don't like arcanum ._.
2013-02-20 12:42:05	GarthAlgar	also, troika went 3d :P
2013-02-20 12:42:12	namad8	well just in terms of history arcanum is the last game made
2013-02-20 12:42:25	namad8	arcanum is the last triple a 90's western black isle style rpg
2013-02-20 12:42:38	namad8	and even if you didn't like it you might've liked the game that followed it and had a different setting
2013-02-20 12:42:42	namad8	something like bg3 or whatever
2013-02-20 12:42:43	Malachite	man i wish they could come out with a new arcanum
2013-02-20 12:42:52	namad8	arcanum has quite a lot of fan mods you could try out
2013-02-20 12:43:04	namad8	although none really change the game as drastically as a proper total conversion
2013-02-20 12:43:07	GarthAlgar	they would need to add a whole new game to it, cause the one time i played, it was bad
2013-02-20 12:43:16	GarthAlgar	everything looks like crap and then it crashes
2013-02-20 12:43:33	namad8	i'm not entirely sure what you're referring to
2013-02-20 12:43:43	GarthAlgar	the ugly visuals and the terrible quality control
2013-02-20 12:43:52	namad8	a lot of people hated the game's plot and pacing
2013-02-20 12:44:08	GarthAlgar	there was that crash site with all the non-choosen characters, which was somewhat nice
2013-02-20 12:44:12	namad8	but it's the best looking and most modern technologically game in the vein of the icewind dale fallout baldur's wind classics
2013-02-20 12:44:22	GarthAlgar	and then there was some sort of town nearby that looked completely terrible and then it crashed
2013-02-20 12:44:27	namad8	like just in terms of the fidelity of the sprites and icons
2013-02-20 12:44:28	GarthAlgar	and i didn't feel like continueing that game
2013-02-20 12:44:46	namad8	arcanum is a very slow starter, the plot starts slow, and the pacing and writing aren't the most interesting ever
2013-02-20 12:45:00	namad8	i just meant that i wish those sorts of games kept evolving
2013-02-20 12:45:16	GarthAlgar	that somehow seems to be a common theme with those games
2013-02-20 12:45:21	GarthAlgar	they all have terrible shitty starts
2013-02-20 12:45:24	namad8	the fact arcanum was so poorly received and sold so poorly definitately contribued to killing that sort of game forever
2013-02-20 12:45:31	GarthAlgar	and i don't like that one bit :P
2013-02-20 12:45:41	Malachite	and thats a damn shame
2013-02-20 12:45:43	namad8	i dunno i dont mind them all
2013-02-20 12:45:59	namad8	i like the start of fallout1, icewind dale2, and baldur's gate 2 much more than the awful starts of baldur's gate 1, fallout 2, and arcanum
2013-02-20 12:46:01	GarthAlgar	they are like the stupid modern forced tutorial levels
2013-02-20 12:46:15	GarthAlgar	i am like "let me play already" and just hate it
2013-02-20 12:46:27	namad8	if you'd played arcanum longer you'd have hated it even more
2013-02-20 12:46:32	namad8	that first town is like the worst town in any game ever
2013-02-20 12:46:47	namad8	because you can't leave without completing a quest, that's pretty hard, and all the other things to do in the town are boring and stupid
2013-02-20 12:46:53	GarthAlgar	well, i was in that town for a bit, but i can't really remember much
2013-02-20 12:46:55	namad8	so you can't skip it
2013-02-20 12:47:10	namad8	that town has caused like 90% of the players who disliked arcanum to dislike it
2013-02-20 12:47:13	namad8	it's bad design
2013-02-20 12:47:31	namad8	you're trapped unable to leave until you do a hard thing, so you need to do a few easy things to progress to the point you can do the hard thing
2013-02-20 12:47:38	namad8	but the easy things are awful, the worst written most boring things in the game
2013-02-20 12:47:52	namad8	and the whole game is supposed to be open world so why are you ever stuck ever anyways? you've never stuck again throughout the next 50hours
2013-02-20 12:48:19	namad8	it's like an encapulsated tutorial town in which there is a boring basic quest of each type just to make sure you understand the game before letting you out to explore the world and possibly get in over your head
2013-02-20 12:48:30	namad8	a bit like fallout 2 's start only more boring and more longer winded
2013-02-20 12:48:46	GauHelldragon	punch more ants
2013-02-20 12:48:47	GauHelldragon	wait
2013-02-20 12:48:50	GauHelldragon	what happened to namad7
2013-02-20 12:48:53	namad8	arcanum's saving grace is that after the 1-4most boring hours of all time the game becomes the most amazingly wide open and creative rpg ever
2013-02-20 12:48:59	 *	Kidiri punches GauHelldragon.
2013-02-20 12:48:59	roushguy	Worktime
2013-02-20 12:49:00	GarthAlgar	fallout 2's start you can run through very quickly, at least
2013-02-20 12:49:24	namad8	i tried to get a friend to play arcanum, he loves fallout1, and fallout2, he agreed to play, he couldn't stomach how boring the town was and refused to ever play again ever under penalty of attacking me
2013-02-20 12:49:30	GarthAlgar	someone should have told them that first impressions count
2013-02-20 12:49:34	namad8	imagine the temple of ants taking 2hours
2013-02-20 12:49:51	Kidiri	All previous namads have undergone the same fate, GauHelldragon.
2013-02-20 12:49:56	namad8	well one thing about arcanum is that terrible first impression actually serves as a hidden tutorial
2013-02-20 12:50:07	GauHelldragon	fetch me the root of brock flower
2013-02-20 12:50:08	namad8	in which you're free to learn about the game without an actual tutorial
2013-02-20 12:50:14	namad8	the problem is that there's no way to skip it properly
2013-02-20 12:50:36	namad8	so it's a pretty good tutorial, but it's like 3hours long and unskippable, and some people veterans of the series didn't need that hand holding
2013-02-20 12:50:55	namad8	it's probably the best 3hour tutorial that will ever be written, but imo tutorials should all last 5-10minutes
2013-02-20 12:51:02	namad8	and a 3hour tutorial is enough to kill a man
2013-02-20 12:51:03	GauHelldragon	icewind dale 2 didn't have a long start??
2013-02-20 12:51:12	namad8	not really
2013-02-20 12:51:23	namad8	it started you off with boring easy combats but icewind dale series was never plot heavy
2013-02-20 12:51:30	namad8	icewind dale is the combat heavy remake of baldur's gate
2013-02-20 12:51:37	namad8	or baldur's gate is the plot heavy remake of the icewind dale series
2013-02-20 12:51:47	GauHelldragon	i think bg was first
2013-02-20 12:51:53	namad8	yes it was first
2013-02-20 12:51:57	GauHelldragon	:3
2013-02-20 12:51:57	namad8	yes players hated the kobold invasion which is the start

2013-02-20 12:52:07	namad8	but it really only took like 20-30minutes and it was full of combat
2013-02-20 12:52:13	GauHelldragon	what? they did?
2013-02-20 12:52:16	namad8	the main reason players hated it is that you had to kill all the kobolds
2013-02-20 12:52:24	GauHelldragon	i don't remember hating it
2013-02-20 12:52:28	namad8	and so there'd be a kobold left hiding in a building you didn't explore and you couldn't progress
2013-02-20 12:52:36	namad8	but really wtf why wouldn't you want to explore all the buildings?
2013-02-20 12:52:42	GauHelldragon	i definitly don't remember that part.
2013-02-20 12:52:44	namad8	other than maybe playing it for the 3rd time and knowing the buildings had no loot
2013-02-20 12:52:46	GauHelldragon	what are we talking about
2013-02-20 12:52:52	namad8	maybe i'm confusing icewind dale 1 and 2
2013-02-20 12:52:57	namad8	one of the two starts that way :)
2013-02-20 12:52:58	GauHelldragon	is this still the first part of icewind dale 2
2013-02-20 12:53:08	GauHelldragon	yeah that is probably iwd1
2013-02-20 12:53:12	namad8	it's either the starting area in icewind dale 1 or 2, it's possible i confused them
2013-02-20 12:53:16	namad8	how's 2 start?
2013-02-20 12:53:17	GauHelldragon	i think you start off fighting goblins in 2
2013-02-20 12:53:24	GauHelldragon	you arrive on a boat
2013-02-20 12:53:26	GauHelldragon	and the city is under siege
2013-02-20 12:53:30	namad8	no that's what i am talking about
2013-02-20 12:53:33	GauHelldragon	or, it's about to be under siege
2013-02-20 12:53:34	namad8	that's what i am describing
2013-02-20 12:53:40	namad8	in order to lift the siege you have to kill them all
2013-02-20 12:53:44	GauHelldragon	and you do a few quests, and then the siege starts
2013-02-20 12:53:50	namad8	if you try to leave without fully exploring the starting area it won't let you
2013-02-20 12:53:52	namad8	because lol siege
2013-02-20 12:53:59	GauHelldragon	OH, the very first part
2013-02-20 12:54:04	GauHelldragon	yes yes, right as you get there
2013-02-20 12:54:17	namad8	honestly though i thought it was one of the best starting areas ever because honestly shut up whiners its short and full of combat its not tha tbad
2013-02-20 12:54:17	GauHelldragon	ok yes i remember that now
2013-02-20 12:54:26	namad8	imo it's not bad, but i've read complaints
2013-02-20 12:54:31	GauHelldragon	no it's not bad at all
2013-02-20 12:54:35	namad8	in general people just don't like articial limits
2013-02-20 12:54:38	GauHelldragon	oh wah you have to explore an area?

2013-02-20 12:55:00	Malachite	why does it feel like naptime
2013-02-20 12:55:12	sandbox	different strokes
2013-02-20 12:55:42	GauHelldragon	ok but what about
2013-02-20 12:55:45	namad8	honestly i think it would have been improved letting you leave a few goblins alive to murder the wives and children
2013-02-20 12:55:48	GauHelldragon	neverwinter nights!!?!?!?!
2013-02-20 12:55:57	namad8	neverwinter nights 2 starts off painfully slow iirc
2013-02-20 12:56:01	GarthAlgar	classic bioware, terrible start
2013-02-20 12:56:08	namad8	nwn1 i haven't played in so long i can't recall
2013-02-20 12:56:10	GarthAlgar	i didn't try nwn2 due to nwn1
2013-02-20 12:56:13	namad8	i didn't mind kotor1's start
2013-02-20 12:56:21	namad8	nwn1's expansions all start fast though
2013-02-20 12:56:22	GauHelldragon	i really loved nwn1
2013-02-20 12:56:25	namad8	and there were 3of them and they were great
2013-02-20 12:56:26	GauHelldragon	never played the second though
2013-02-20 12:56:34	namad8	i didn't like the party system in nwn2
2013-02-20 12:56:42	namad8	because it meant there were 13810890 buffs to cast each rest instead of just a couple
2013-02-20 12:56:51	GauHelldragon	ha
2013-02-20 12:56:55	namad8	that's why mask of the betrayer is so good
2013-02-20 12:57:00	GauHelldragon	yes that is one of the more annoying parts of D&D
2013-02-20 12:57:06	namad8	it's basically a mod that makes resting limited in nwn2 (it's an official expansion from obsidian)
2013-02-20 12:57:10	GauHelldragon	and pretty much all D&D games
2013-02-20 12:57:14	GauHelldragon	fuckin casting buffs
2013-02-20 12:57:21	namad8	well tons of resting isn't a problem alone
2013-02-20 12:57:27	namad8	and tons of buff isn't a problem with limited rests
2013-02-20 12:57:46	namad8	so nwn1 is okay and nwn2's expansion packs are okay but base nwn2 drove me mad
2013-02-20 12:58:40	namad8	i really hope obsidian's new kickstarter rpg turns into basically arcanum 2
2013-02-20 12:58:47	namad8	from what i've read it seems fairly likely

2013-02-20 12:59:55	namad8	gauhelldragon though or garthalgar i highly recommend you give arcanum another shot, consider using a walkthrough to beat the bridge quest in the first town, as fast as possible, then stopping using it... the amount of open world mystery and uniquness the world has is basically unmatched
2013-02-20 13:00:11	namad8	if you're a vet you can basically cheese past the roadblock if you know how
2013-02-20 13:00:15	GauHelldragon	? i like arcanum
2013-02-20 13:00:20	GauHelldragon	i played through it to the end
2013-02-20 13:00:38	GauHelldragon	i mean i guess i could play it again?!
2013-02-20 13:00:42	GauHelldragon	go techno guy this time
2013-02-20 13:01:05	Malachite	i never could get into the game
2013-02-20 13:01:57	namad8	if you want to go techno i recommend the fanpatch
2013-02-20 13:02:03	namad8	which adds a few schematics
2013-02-20 13:02:27	GauHelldragon	oh? cool
2013-02-20 13:02:28	sandbox	obsidian has another star wars rpg in the works
2013-02-20 13:02:30	namad8	arcanum starts very slowly, and involves a lot of tedium as a technomancer, and a bit of patience as a mage, playing as a warrior is the most straight fowrard

2013-02-20 13:03:50	namad8	fallout 1/2 have similar projects to them too
2013-02-20 13:04:01	namad8	bg has such projects as well

2013-02-20 14:32:14	namad7	who is what guy?
2013-02-20 14:32:34	nuthulu	thespoonyone
2013-02-20 14:33:25	GauHelldragon	i don't know what the "scream/whine" thing is
2013-02-20 14:33:27	GauHelldragon	but it sounds awful
2013-02-20 14:33:33	namad7	yeah it sounds awful too
2013-02-20 14:33:41	BW	it's a music genre
2013-02-20 14:33:42	namad7	and his name doesn't sound any more professional than i'm envisioning

2013-02-20 14:38:38	namad7	man i wish starbound was out
2013-02-20 14:38:54	GauHelldragon	ok
2013-02-20 14:39:04	BW	i wish people weren't idiots
2013-02-20 14:39:15	nuthulu	namad7 I have one fear of that game
2013-02-20 14:39:21	BW	although….it does keep me in food and shelter
2013-02-20 14:39:25	nuthulu	that people will get let down and rage
2013-02-20 14:39:38	GauHelldragon	of course people are gonna be let down
2013-02-20 14:39:41	GauHelldragon	game is hyped to shit
2013-02-20 14:39:42	nuthulu	Since the starbound community (or at least live chat) is 90% children
2013-02-20 14:39:53	namad7	do any gems besides spells and power siphon work with a wand equipped?
2013-02-20 14:39:59	namad7	whoops wrong channel sorry
2013-02-20 14:40:18	namad7	even if starbound is just a reskinned terraria people will love it
2013-02-20 14:40:27	nuthulu	I'm going to attempt to guess that game....path of exile?
2013-02-20 14:40:29	GauHelldragon	i wouldn't mind playing a reskinned terraria
2013-02-20 14:40:32	namad7	which is why it's odd that it's not just a dlc for terraria they spent 100hours on and sold for 20$
2013-02-20 14:40:37	namad7	nuthulu yep poe
2013-02-20 14:41:04	namad7	indies suck at robbing their fans
2013-02-20 14:41:05	nuthulu	I'm currently stuck on the end of act 2 boss, as in I can't be fucked to go through all of the pyramid again
2013-02-20 14:41:26	namad7	we could do it together if you wanted if you're on normal hardcore, otherwise i can't help
2013-02-20 14:41:57	nuthulu	I'm on normal default league, I was thinking of beating the game before trying hardcore
2013-02-20 14:42:08	nuthulu	But I can't muster the effort to beat it
2013-02-20 14:42:50	namad7	when ob first came out i had a lot of trouble beating act 2
2013-02-20 14:43:02	namad7	because it took me like 20minutes to do the pyramid and i crashed on the top floor each time
2013-02-20 14:43:09	nuthulu	See i'm playing as a duelist
2013-02-20 14:43:10	namad7	and the nearest waypoint was so far back that the instance reset on me
2013-02-20 14:43:11	nuthulu	gone archer
2013-02-20 14:43:18	namad7	duelists are the worst class in the game according to the devs
2013-02-20 14:43:24	namad7	but archers are pretty op in general :)
2013-02-20 14:43:30	nuthulu	Wait
2013-02-20 14:43:56	nuthulu	I found witch to be worse in some senses, Templar to be really boring and isn't melee combat broke anyways
2013-02-20 14:44:06	namad7	duelist archers are prolly fine tho because ranger archers usually go through deulist area to marauder area
2013-02-20 14:44:12	namad7	witches do the worst in races
2013-02-20 14:44:23	namad7	witches are slow burners and have been nerfed a lot recently so devs must've thought they were good
2013-02-20 14:44:32	namad7	really atm melee is the worst just because lol melee has to stand in a dangerous spot
2013-02-20 14:44:45	nuthulu	Yeah with archer you can just run away from attacks
2013-02-20 14:44:47	namad7	but amongst broken bad melee, duelist are usually seen as the worst melee'ers
2013-02-20 14:45:04	namad7	however melee is OP at low levels
2013-02-20 14:45:14	namad7	melee sucks in merciless but in normal? it's the best
2013-02-20 14:45:24	nuthulu	The only real reason I lost against vaal oversoul is because his minions that are based off the construct things that shoot purple shit had a huge swarm
2013-02-20 14:45:38	namad7	maraduers always do well in races and are easy to play
2013-02-20 14:45:48	namad7	against vaal ignore vaal a lot
2013-02-20 14:45:51	nuthulu	I mean I had it down to about half health, its attacks are pretty easy to avoid as well
2013-02-20 14:45:53	namad7	and make sure to kill his minions as soon as they spawn
2013-02-20 14:46:01	namad7	learn to look for their spawn modules and prepare to kill them as they appear
2013-02-20 14:46:18	nuthulu	Well, see my bow doesn't really one hit them, so with a decent swarm of them I was taking too much damage
2013-02-20 14:46:41	namad7	what level are you?
2013-02-20 14:47:01	namad7	also two hitting them isn't so bad
2013-02-20 14:47:05	<--	Alu (~quassel@NewNet-EBBC6A56.unitymediagroup.de) has quit (Connection reset by peer)
2013-02-20 14:47:28	namad7	they spawn predictable you need to kill them as they sppear to avoid being overhwlmed
2013-02-20 14:47:30	nuthulu	I'm either a level ahead of the areas level, or on it
2013-02-20 14:48:02	nuthulu	Also to be fair, the pyramid and the area before it is really fun strategically since you have all those totems that make various buffs
2013-02-20 14:50:46	nuthulu	My bow isn't really the best either, but i'm trying to get a different bow to upgrade into a yellow when I find one of those stone things that can do that. Although my current bow has something like 1-25 lightning damage as well as the regular physical
2013-02-20 14:51:27	namad7	using orbs of alchemy at low levels is strictly non-optimal
2013-02-20 14:51:40	namad7	perfect awesome low level rare weapons are only worth one orb of alchemy anyways usually
2013-02-20 14:51:45	namad7	so trying to gamble on making one isn't super great
2013-02-20 14:51:49	namad7	because of handmedowns and trading
2013-02-20 14:52:43	namad7	you can also always try doing dread thicket a few times for a large chest and maybe get something good? it's a small cave near the end of act2 with a like 30% chance of large chest instead of the typical like 10-20% most areas have?
2013-02-20 14:52:44	nuthulu	Well my current bow is actually pretty good, it's just the other bow is a better bow "Type", I think it's composite or recurved or something
2013-02-20 14:53:23	namad7	beating a boss at the same level as the area of the boss is very hard
2013-02-20 14:53:33	namad7	as a noob you might wanna be 2or3 o4 levels too high for vaal
2013-02-20 14:53:42	nuthulu	I can get about 117 dps on the poison shot of my bow
2013-02-20 14:53:42	namad7	beating at the level or below by 1or2 is like pro race tactics
2013-02-20 14:53:53	namad7	i get 150dps on my poison shot
2013-02-20 14:53:57	namad7	and my ranger is level 25
2013-02-20 14:54:16	nuthulu	Yeah but isn't ranger in a better passive position?
2013-02-20 14:54:18	namad7	i'm using a bone bow of burning
2013-02-20 14:54:24	namad7	with one magical bonus
2013-02-20 14:54:34	namad7	and yes rangers are in a better position somewhat
2013-02-20 14:54:35	nuthulu	Ah see I don't have a bone bow
2013-02-20 14:54:45	namad7	it requires level 24
2013-02-20 14:54:51	nuthulu	Also I take it the passive skill that turns all evasion into armour isn't that great
2013-02-20 14:54:53	namad7	and this bow is fairly awful it's got one magical bonus only
2013-02-20 14:55:00	namad7	it's amazing
2013-02-20 14:55:01	namad7	best in the game
2013-02-20 14:55:05	namad7	everyone should take it if they're near it
2013-02-20 14:55:13	namad7	at least that's popular opinion
2013-02-20 14:55:14	nuthulu	Ah so I shouldn't have unspecced out of it x|
2013-02-20 14:55:21	namad7	the way it works is that it double counts
2013-02-20 14:55:32	nuthulu	Since isn't evasion at this point nearly useless
2013-02-20 14:55:38	namad7	so every node that effects either amour or evasion will raise your ironreflexed armour total
2013-02-20 14:55:50	namad7	evasion imo is better early than late
2013-02-20 14:55:54	namad7	but still armour is good
2013-02-20 14:56:50	namad7	although also i dont much like poison shot much i am using lightning arrow with lesser multiple projectiles to pwn everything and before that i used split fire with fork
2013-02-20 14:57:40	nuthulu	I find poison is useful when dealing with an elite or with tougher groups
2013-02-20 14:58:18	nuthulu	You know that rain of arrows attack? I have a life support gem with that, meaning I get about 14 life for every enemy I hit with it. If I use that on a swarm of enemies I get back a tonne of health.
2013-02-20 14:58:19	namad7	although poison shot is good to shoot at vaal
2013-02-20 14:58:28	namad7	i never got rain of arrows
2013-02-20 14:58:34	nuthulu	I may swap the life gem to poison though, since rain of arrows has a rather low dps
2013-02-20 14:58:40	namad7	i always wnated to try it but i was too lazy to make a secnod ranger to earn the gem and transfer it to this ranger
2013-02-20 14:58:57	namad7	well life on hit only works well with abilities that generate lots of hits
2013-02-20 14:59:03	namad7	poison arrow generates at most one hit per attack
2013-02-20 14:59:13	AfterShave	Mind if I ask why your current ranger can't acquire that gem?
2013-02-20 14:59:15	AfterShave	I don't play PoE
2013-02-20 14:59:32	gargantuan	morning
2013-02-20 14:59:32	nuthulu	Oh I thought the poison cloud thing counted

2013-02-20 15:05:07	namad7	we can talk about it some more
2013-02-20 15:05:10	namad7	the cloud doesn't count as hits at all
2013-02-20 15:05:17	namad7	it's an effect type dealio
2013-02-20 15:05:29	namad7	gems are both active skills and loot
2013-02-20 15:05:35	namad7	they're random loot and quest progression rewards
2013-02-20 15:05:40	namad7	i chose the better skill instead of rain of arrows :)
2013-02-20 15:05:46	namad7	but i wanted to experiment with rain of arrows
2013-02-20 15:05:57	namad7	if i had made an alt i could've gotten the gem off his quest progression and transfered it, it's a low level reward
2013-02-20 15:06:35	namad7	actually though the skill i took was ice shot, i read it was good, but i hate it
2013-02-20 15:06:59	namad7	they're level 4quest rewards though that take like 10minutes to earn
2013-02-20 15:07:16	namad7	it's actually a free game for anyone to play
2013-02-20 15:07:25	namad7	www.pathofexile.com
2013-02-20 15:08:01	AfterShave	I know about the game, saw a few classmates play it at school
2013-02-20 15:08:05	namad7	a good skill to put life on hit on would be something like fork split fire because you'd gain like tons of life per click against a swarm of enemies you'd get like 9times the life you would from say poison arrow
2013-02-20 15:08:16	AfterShave	I haven't quite been into that kind of game for the last, 6 years ir si
2013-02-20 15:08:18	AfterShave	Or so*
2013-02-20 15:10:19	namad7	i've gotten some nice drops since we started talking you guys must be good luck
2013-02-20 15:10:41	namad7	a great place to discuss the game tho is #pathofexile on freenode server, ingame chat is kind of full of idiots :)
2013-02-20 15:11:10	AfterShave	Why is it usually like that?
2013-02-20 15:11:22	AfterShave	Ingame is meh, outside chats are better
2013-02-20 15:11:43	namad7	ingame chats are just everyone lumped together even those who don't care to be there?
2013-02-20 15:11:52	namad7	outof game chats are extra effort, it's like the somethingawful paywall
2013-02-20 15:11:58	namad7	effort to get in breeds behavior inside
2013-02-20 15:12:33	AfterShave	I'd say it's not much more effort than getting the game itself
2013-02-20 15:12:47	AfterShave	Download, install, register go in

2013-02-20 16:44:04	namad7	wow i just found a new youtube trick
2013-02-20 16:44:09	namad7	set all videos to private
2013-02-20 16:44:13	namad7	create playlists of the videos
2013-02-20 16:44:29	namad7	upload tons of illegally copyrighted stuff, laugh at hollywood
2013-02-20 16:45:38	AfterShave	But, why?
2013-02-20 16:45:45	AfterShave	Except to laugh at hollywood
2013-02-20 16:45:45	namad7	well i don't know but it seems to work
2013-02-20 16:45:52	namad7	it either makes it impossible to get the video taken down
2013-02-20 16:46:06	namad7	or it just makes it impossible for the robots which actually request videos be taken down to do their job
2013-02-20 16:46:12	namad7	and that a real human being could easily report these videos
2013-02-20 16:46:23	AfterShave	Interesting
2013-02-20 16:46:33	namad7	but only robots get copyright content removed from teh internet hence the high instance of incorrect dmca's
2013-02-20 16:46:41	namad7	dmca's to invalid links or to someone's own webpage
2013-02-20 16:46:50	AfterShave	But they're private, sharing would be pretty, meh. Wouldn't it?
2013-02-20 16:47:08	namad7	oh i meant unlisted
2013-02-20 16:47:13	namad7	not totally private just unlisted
2013-02-20 16:47:23	namad7	the point is that people can still watch them
2013-02-20 16:47:28	AfterShave	Ah
2013-02-20 16:47:38	AfterShave	I thought you meant, private for real only invited friends can watch private :P

2013-02-20 16:48:12	namad7	nah, it can still be taken down but i guess somehwo being unlisted makes it resistant to whatever dumbfire automated shotgun hollywood type robots use
2013-02-20 16:48:30	AfterShave	I haven't really used them to shoot at much more than the snowy fields of a glacier
2013-02-20 16:48:38	AfterShave	They skip and leave skidmarks as they go
2013-02-20 16:49:01	AfterShave	That's their deal

2013-02-20 16:49:31	AfterShave	wat
2013-02-20 16:50:07	GauHelldragon	well you aren't allowed to say, rent an ampitheatre and show it to 50000 people
2013-02-20 16:50:20	GauHelldragon	that is a violation of copyright
2013-02-20 16:50:34	GauHelldragon	it says so on the FBI warning thing at the start of every movie ever!
2013-02-20 16:50:44	GauHelldragon	but it's clearly not illegal to say, show it to your family
2013-02-20 16:50:44	AfterShave	I don't get no FBI warning
2013-02-20 16:50:55	GauHelldragon	so the question is, where do they draw the line?!
2013-02-20 16:51:00	AfterShave	I'm an alien
2013-02-20 16:51:01	GauHelldragon	yes you do

2013-02-20 18:27:19	Makrond	i guess
2013-02-20 18:27:44	roushguy	Going to change dragons, so they live in magma/lava, and their scales are formed of metal.
2013-02-20 18:27:57	roushguy	Said metal is 'sweated' out, forming the scales.
2013-02-20 18:28:11	roushguy	Their bones will also become superpowerful.
2013-02-20 18:28:19	Makrond	problem
2013-02-20 18:28:26	Makrond	how does the metal not get subsumed into the lava
2013-02-20 18:28:44	fennec	there are magmaproof metals, i guess
2013-02-20 18:29:02	roushguy	Well, the metal will be a new type
2013-02-20 18:29:10	roushguy	It will be, as fennec said, magmaproof
2013-02-20 18:29:14	Makrond	i mean it makes sense by df logic because magma isn't actually all that hot
2013-02-20 18:29:26	Makrond	okay that's cool
2013-02-20 18:29:44	roushguy	Their bones will also technically be metal
2013-02-20 18:29:48	roushguy	At least by DF standards.
2013-02-20 18:30:06	roushguy	The scales I plan on dropping in wafers, if possible, based on their thickness

2013-02-20 19:51:23	roushguy	Dragons are apparently still one-shottable even at 9999999999 size.
2013-02-20 19:51:41	roushguy	With a candy twohanded sword.
2013-02-20 20:08:56	NEO|Phyte	delicious candy
2013-02-20 20:09:13	roushguy	But I want a nigh-invincible dragon.

2013-02-20 20:49:11	roushguy	So I found something interesting while tinkering with some stuff
2013-02-20 20:50:51	Hollywars	like what
2013-02-20 20:52:22	roushguy	You can embark with more than 10k points.
2013-02-20 20:53:00	Hollywars	how
2013-02-20 20:53:11	roushguy	Go into the init file and manually change it.
2013-02-20 20:53:19	roushguy	You'll start with however many you put.
2013-02-20 20:53:22	Hollywars	ah I'm sure someone figure dit out before
2013-02-20 20:53:28	roushguy	Probably.
2013-02-20 20:53:35	Hollywars	but it's always fun to make your own discoveries
2013-02-20 20:53:37	roushguy	But it was one of those 'huh that's cool' moments.
2013-02-20 20:53:41	Hollywars	ya
2013-02-20 20:53:45	Hollywars	like i was doing this physics problem
2013-02-20 20:53:50	roushguy	Hmmm.
2013-02-20 20:53:57	roushguy	How do I make dragons tameable.
2013-02-20 20:53:57	Hollywars	and it was figuring out the charge on a capacitor of an RC circuit
2013-02-20 20:54:06	roushguy	OH
2013-02-20 20:54:11	roushguy	Hollywars, are you good at creature mods?
2013-02-20 20:54:16	Hollywars	where the R and C were 2 resisters in parallel and 2 capacitors in parallel respectively
2013-02-20 20:54:31	Hollywars	and I figured out that the charge is based on the capacitance
2013-02-20 20:54:44	Hollywars	like the ration is capacitance to total capacitance for the charge on each capacitor
2013-02-20 20:55:00	 *	roushguy politely listens, but understands none of it.
2013-02-20 20:55:05	Hollywars	nah not a DF modder sorry, also sorry you all needed to hear that
2013-02-20 20:55:26	roushguy	Damn.
2013-02-20 20:55:44	roushguy	Need someone to help me completely wreck dragons and rebuild them from the ground up.
2013-02-20 20:57:05	Hollywars	good luck :)
2013-02-20 20:57:17	roushguy	Gonna make them sweat scales of a new material
2013-02-20 20:57:23	Hollywars	wat
2013-02-20 20:57:25	roushguy	And their bones be made of another new material
2013-02-20 20:57:26	roushguy	Yup
2013-02-20 20:57:31	Hollywars	just sweat?
2013-02-20 20:57:34	roushguy	The idea is as such
2013-02-20 20:57:45	roushguy	They require mainly heat to stay alive
2013-02-20 20:57:54	roushguy	So they prefer to stay in/near volcanoes and magma
2013-02-20 20:58:04	roushguy	They drink the magma to gain nutrition.
2013-02-20 20:58:23	roushguy	The excess metal has to leave their bloodstream, though, so they 'sweat' it out
2013-02-20 20:58:32	roushguy	Forming scales of a strange new metal
2013-02-20 20:58:36	Hollywars	well thats a lovely theory
2013-02-20 20:58:52	roushguy	Their bones are also high in metal content so they're also 'metal' by DF standarsd.
2013-02-20 20:58:54	roushguy	Standards*
2013-02-20 20:59:06	Hollywars	but it's also not a real world chemical reaction so i think you just make it these ways
2013-02-20 20:59:21	Hollywars	well i also have no idea
2013-02-20 20:59:26	Hollywars	pretty cool though, good luck
2013-02-20 20:59:32	roushguy	Heh.
2013-02-20 20:59:40	roushguy	I have an entire fantasy world bopping around my head atm
2013-02-20 20:59:50	roushguy	Based around said dragons.
2013-02-20 20:59:51	Hollywars	well maybe write it down so you dont forget it
2013-02-20 20:59:56	roushguy	Not gonna happen
2013-02-20 21:00:02	roushguy	Their breath weapons aren't fire
2013-02-20 21:00:09	roushguy	It's literally hot air.
2013-02-20 21:00:26	roushguy	Hot air is also how the help themselves fly.
2013-02-20 21:01:26	roushguy	Tiny sacs, like alveoli, fill with extra hot air that bleeds through the wings, creating a hot-air balloon sort of effect under their wings.
2013-02-20 21:01:49	roushguy	When that pocket of air gets too cold, they flap, dispersing it, and re-heat the pocket.

2013-02-21 02:27:58	Justin	hm
2013-02-21 02:28:01	Justin	from what I'm understanding
2013-02-21 02:28:07	Justin	arguments are like parameters except
2013-02-21 02:28:14	sandbox	I wonder if people will die from old age while you are talking to them
2013-02-21 02:28:28	Justin	parameters have a set amount, according to the function, or none at all
2013-02-21 02:28:33	sandbox	or yourself
2013-02-21 02:29:15	Justin	while you can have as many arguments as possible when you "unpack" them
2013-02-21 02:29:17	Justin	does this make sense?
2013-02-21 02:29:48	Phazorx	really, Justin, there are hundreds of decent python tutorials, and perhaps you would ened to start with general program logic books explaining what are operands, values and variables, states, expression etc
2013-02-21 02:29:58	gargantuan	that's ambigous
2013-02-21 02:30:06	Justin	Phazorx: ???
2013-02-21 02:30:13	gargantuan	do the python tutorial on the python website
2013-02-21 02:30:16	gargantuan	it's solid
2013-02-21 02:30:28	Phazorx	argument and parameter most of tame is a same thing, usualy you would call something an argument if it has external origin, say arguments command line scripts
2013-02-21 02:30:31	gargantuan	arguments and parameters are often used interchangably in jargon
2013-02-21 02:30:43	Justin	garg: yes
2013-02-21 02:30:50	Justin	also I'm using "Learn Python The Hard Way"
2013-02-21 02:30:56	gargantuan	args has a special meaning in POSIX as what gets passed to the running process
2013-02-21 02:31:00	Phazorx	while parameters is pertty much same thing but usualy coming from local contrxt, say parameters for a function
2013-02-21 02:31:00	Justin	which is the most beginners-friendly guide I've seen

2013-02-21 03:14:01	Justin	is "argv" a function of the library "sys"?
2013-02-21 03:14:49	jotham	argv is a member of the sys module that member can have any type, function is a type of type
2013-02-21 03:15:23	jotham	in this case argv is a list
2013-02-21 03:15:24	jotham	>>> from sys import argv
2013-02-21 03:15:24	jotham	>>> type(argv)
2013-02-21 03:15:24	jotham	<type 'list'>
2013-02-21 03:15:52	jotham	a list is a sequence abstraction, it stores things one after another
2013-02-21 03:16:03	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-21 03:16:47	Justin	modules ARE libraries, right?
2013-02-21 03:16:47	jotham	having the python interpreter open and dicking about is super useful
2013-02-21 03:16:59	Justin	yeah I did some dicking in the interpreter myself
2013-02-21 03:17:06	jotham	library or module is just jargon, it means a collection of loadable items
2013-02-21 03:17:33	Justin	isn't it basically a bunch of code that's been coded by another programmer
2013-02-21 03:17:40	Justin	that you can "unpack" into your own script?
2013-02-21 03:17:51	jotham	by loadable i mean the python language can interpret what is in the module and make it avaliable to the current interpeter context
2013-02-21 03:17:52	Phazorx	unless module is a part of package it's pretty much same as folder with source files
2013-02-21 03:18:09	jotham	yeah a package is another level of complexity
2013-02-21 03:18:36	Phazorx	importing modules is a way of expanding namespace
2013-02-21 03:18:42	Justin	man programming is scary :(
2013-02-21 03:18:52	jotham	you basically have to start mapping internally programmer jargon and python specific jargon, lots of it will be ambigious and difficult
2013-02-21 03:19:00	jotham	sure
2013-02-21 03:19:07	jotham	programming is hard
2013-02-21 03:19:13	<--	Essence13 (~chatzilla@NewNet-26C2BAF6.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has quit (ChatZilla 0.9.90 [Firefox 18.0.1/20130116073211])
2013-02-21 03:19:15	Justin	and unrewarding
2013-02-21 03:19:16	Justin	:V
2013-02-21 03:19:32	jotham	fuck that, i've spent god awful number of years doing it and absolutely enjoy it
2013-02-21 03:19:35	Justin	but I can at least boast about it, among the floods of people who can program
2013-02-21 03:19:37	jotham	even teach it at a local university
2013-02-21 03:19:40	Justin	:V
2013-02-21 03:19:42	Justin	heh
2013-02-21 03:19:51	<--	LordNagash (~Nagash@DEC8CF54.3B3E241.17A025.IP) has quit (<Commondragon> How do people see all this potential in me)
2013-02-21 03:20:26	Justin	would you say ActionScript or Python is harder to learn?
2013-02-21 03:20:41	Justin	(btw I'm using Python 2.7.3)
2013-02-21 03:20:50	jotham	basically fuck about and get to know things, key is 'more information is better', the panic will wane slowly as the abstraction resolves in your mind
2013-02-21 03:20:55	jotham	that's when it starts to get exciting
2013-02-21 03:20:57	Justin	(well, Python 2.7.x)
2013-02-21 03:21:28	Justin	also programming jargon has too many synonyms
2013-02-21 03:21:43	jotham	actionscript is easier because it has type hinting to catch you when you fall but harder because it has the illusion of static types which can be awkward for new developers
2013-02-21 03:21:46	Justin	just standardize everything, assholes >:(
2013-02-21 03:22:46	jotham	you can't standardize a dozen paradigms when everyone is barely mentally capable of learning the one they have hitched their wagon to, let alone processing the larger community of software
2013-02-21 03:22:51	Justin	anyway are functions and lists part of the same set of types?
2013-02-21 03:23:23	jotham	a list is a type that collects other types together
2013-02-21 03:23:27	Justin	well true enough, I suppose
2013-02-21 03:23:30	jotham	a function is a type that you can execute
2013-02-21 03:23:39	Justin	so what are "types"
2013-02-21 03:24:34	jotham	a type lets the language know how to deal with a bit of data when it comes across it, for example 1 is an int type (integer) so when python sees 1 + 1 it knows + must work against two integers, so it creates an int of 2
2013-02-21 03:24:57	jotham	but if it sees "a" + "b" the + operator becomes a concatinator and produces "ab"
2013-02-21 03:25:19	jotham	the interpreter that runs your program needs a type to define what the data the type is holding should be used for
2013-02-21 03:25:39	jotham	each type has special behaviour
2013-02-21 03:26:49	Justin	so... are types the foundation for all programming languages?
2013-02-21 03:26:53	jotham	yeah
2013-02-21 03:26:57	Justin	right
2013-02-21 03:27:10	Justin	so a string is a type, right?
2013-02-21 03:27:16	jotham	once you get down to the real bones of it, the only type is binary, and operations against it
2013-02-21 03:27:19	jotham	+ is an operation
2013-02-21 03:27:24	jotham	yeah string is a type
2013-02-21 03:27:33	Justin	I see
2013-02-21 03:27:37	Justin	so what's a function
2013-02-21 03:27:39	Justin	exactly
2013-02-21 03:28:01	jotham	a function is a type that represents some discrete program logic and some context for that program logic
2013-02-21 03:28:08	jotham	in python a function is a type of object
2013-02-21 03:28:15	Justin	hm sounds complicated
2013-02-21 03:28:15	jotham	object is an object oriented programming type
2013-02-21 03:28:22	Justin	I think I'll avoid that for now :V
2013-02-21 03:28:49	Justin	so argv is a list?
2013-02-21 03:29:02	jotham	def print_hi(): print "hi"; print_hi is a function type which when operated on with () executes print "hi"
2013-02-21 03:29:07	jotham	() is an operator like +
2013-02-21 03:29:31	Justin	so do operators change a type?
2013-02-21 03:29:33	jotham	"lol"() will cause an error because the interpreter has no idea how to operate () (which is execute) against string("lol")
2013-02-21 03:29:47	jotham	operators can produce a type
2013-02-21 03:29:48	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-21 03:30:20	Phazorx	operators produce result  based on operands
2013-02-21 03:30:49	Phazorx	like a + b, having them of compatible type, will yeild result wich will be some kind of combination of these oeprands
2013-02-21 03:30:51	Justin	so is print basically a shortform of the print function?
2013-02-21 03:30:55	Justin	the
2013-02-21 03:30:59	Justin	"print" in python anyway
2013-02-21 03:31:02	jotham	operands are what the operation is being performed on
2013-02-21 03:31:20	Phazorx	Justin: depending on verion of python print could be function or not
2013-02-21 03:31:26	Phazorx	in python3 it is a function
2013-02-21 03:31:43	jotham	print is a convenience function for opening the STDOUT POSIX buffer (generally) and writing the bytes passed to it
2013-02-21 03:31:47	Justin	I'm using python 2.7.x
2013-02-21 03:32:13	jotham	the difference between a keyword and a function isn't useful in relation to print for you right now
2013-02-21 03:32:39	Justin	http://learnpythonthehardway.com/book/ex18.html
2013-02-21 03:32:47	Justin	under the "Common Student Questions" section
2013-02-21 03:32:52	Justin	"What does the * in *args do?"
2013-02-21 03:32:56	jotham	keywords are symbols (like for, print, etc) reserved by the language to do special things beyond the interpretation of the language
2013-02-21 03:32:56	Justin	"That tells python to take all the arguments to the function and then put them in args as a list. It's like argv that you've been using, but for functions. It's not normally used too often unless specifically needed."
2013-02-21 03:33:19	jotham	* is a bit beyond a useful topic
2013-02-21 03:33:32	Justin	anyway is the author saying that * turns something into a list?
2013-02-21 03:34:27	jotham	it's a bit of magic
2013-02-21 03:34:27	Phazorx	Justin: you can say that * and ** keywords used in function signatures are preception convinience instruments
2013-02-21 03:34:41	Justin	??
2013-02-21 03:34:47	Phazorx	they are a bit more advanced what you need at the moment, could be handy though
2013-02-21 03:34:52	jotham	don't worry about understanding language magic until later
2013-02-21 03:34:52	Justin	ah okay
2013-02-21 03:35:05	Justin	so I'll just ignore this and type * while pretending it's part of the name or something
2013-02-21 03:35:23	Phazorx	well okay, *args have merit even at early stages
2013-02-21 03:35:32	Justin	anyway in the example
2013-02-21 03:35:36	Justin	what if I took the * away from *args
2013-02-21 03:35:44	Justin	what happens?
2013-02-21 03:35:53	<--	Captain (~Captain@NewNet-5C6CE618.dyn.iinet.net.au) has quit (Leaving)
2013-02-21 03:36:05	Phazorx	 in case of f(*args) - it's an instruction for python to pack all ordinal parameters pased to function to a list 'args' available in function concetx
2013-02-21 03:36:22	Phazorx	so within function you could do args[0] to get 1st passed argument and so on
2013-02-21 03:36:48	Justin	:?
2013-02-21 03:36:49	Phazorx	if you would have f(args) instead it wopuld mean that the function expects only one single argument
2013-02-21 03:36:50	jotham	i don't know a convenient way to describe what it's doing without really knowing programming
2013-02-21 03:37:09	Phazorx	value of which will be assigned to variable 'args' which you can use in context of the function
2013-02-21 03:37:14	jotham	consider it magic
2013-02-21 03:37:22	Justin	all right
2013-02-21 03:37:29	Justin	Programming - More magical than a unicorn
2013-02-21 03:37:39	jotham	anything sufficiently advanced is magic
2013-02-21 03:37:53	jotham	you can be the magi!
2013-02-21 03:38:05	Justin	yaaay!
2013-02-21 03:38:16	Justin	anyway Phazorx all of that passed through my head, sorry
2013-02-21 03:38:42	Phazorx	real magic starts when you get to f(self, *args, *, foo, bar=None, **kwargs) level :)
2013-02-21 03:39:43	Justin	so if I'm correct
2013-02-21 03:39:53	Justin	if I don't put the asterisk
2013-02-21 03:40:08	Justin	python would think it's a variable?
2013-02-21 03:40:20	Phazorx	Justin: you could really benefit from backstepping to some book explaning terminology used in programming 1st then have a take on particular programming language tutorial already aware what exactly certain concepts are
2013-02-21 03:40:47	Phazorx	Justin: it would think that the function accepts only one argument
2013-02-21 03:40:48	Justin	while if I put the * in args it would act like argv?
2013-02-21 03:40:54	Justin	hmm okay
2013-02-21 03:41:04	Justin	so *args is like argv in that it can accept a list of arguments?
2013-02-21 03:41:22	Phazorx	if you put * it would think the function can accept any number of arguments and all of them will be made available as that name
2013-02-21 03:41:42	Phazorx	sort of, not sure what are referring to as 'argv' though?
2013-02-21 03:42:43	Justin	'argv' is a type from the 'sys' module in  python
2013-02-21 03:43:17	Phazorx	ahh... sys.argv returns you list of arguments passed to executable from POSIX OS, yes
2013-02-21 03:43:43	jotham	http://agiliq.com/blog/2012/06/understanding-args-and-kwargs/
2013-02-21 03:44:25	jotham	when you start it's easy and probably okay to get sucked into deep confusing rabbit holes like *args
2013-02-21 03:44:36	jotham	but don't let it phase you
2013-02-21 03:44:52	jotham	programming is basically the practice of learning to the edge of the absraction you can handle
2013-02-21 03:44:56	jotham	and stopping
2013-02-21 03:45:03	Justin	anyway Phazorx I don't think I would want to read a terminology book just yet
2013-02-21 03:45:13	jotham	for example, i don't need to understand how to build an electornic NAND gate to write a web site
2013-02-21 03:45:17	Justin	LPTHW is a really, really beginner-level book
2013-02-21 03:45:34	Phazorx	Justin: my opinion is it would help to grasp things faster
2013-02-21 03:45:35	Justin	hell sometimes it assumes that you haven't used a computer before or something
2013-02-21 03:45:39	Phazorx	i have not read that book though
2013-02-21 03:45:50	jotham	it's a good one Phazorx
2013-02-21 03:45:57	Justin	even I found it a little patronising at times :V
2013-02-21 03:46:05	jotham	that and http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/
2013-02-21 03:46:17	Phazorx	jotham: i dont doubt that, but i was dealing with python before it was available :)
2013-02-21 03:46:33	Justin	jotham: it's so hard to ignore the deep ends of programming though
2013-02-21 03:47:03	Justin	"Oh, you want to know what does this mean? Well how about some more jargon to explain that piece of jargon"
2013-02-21 03:47:12	jotham	hey
2013-02-21 03:47:17	apo	It's turtles all the way down
2013-02-21 03:47:22	Phazorx	Justin: you just explained meaning of recurrion there btw
2013-02-21 03:47:30	Phazorx	apo++
2013-02-21 03:47:31	Justin	uhuh
2013-02-21 03:47:32	jotham	i've been awake at 3am on a job at a clients facility totally wasting time learning more than i need to about the problem domain
2013-02-21 03:47:35	jotham	i understand
2013-02-21 03:47:45	jotham	that's also why i have the fortitude to play dwarf fucking fortress
2013-02-21 03:48:28	<--	Trifase (trifase@NewNet-73E3D62C.retail.telecomitalia.it) has quit (TOO MUCH INFORMATION)
2013-02-21 03:49:19	Justin	oh my
2013-02-21 03:49:31	Justin	I just started reading that computer scientist link, skipped to chapter 1
2013-02-21 03:49:39	Justin	I learned quite a number of things already :V
2013-02-21 03:50:15	Justin	I didn't know low-level languages were executable immediately
2013-02-21 03:50:34	Justin	without an intepreter or compiler
2013-02-21 03:51:11	jotham	it's a fairly widely regarded text
2013-02-21 03:52:30	Justin	uhuh
2013-02-21 03:53:11	-->	Trifase (trifase@NewNet-73E3D62C.retail.telecomitalia.it) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-21 03:55:44	Justin	so since python is an intepreted language
2013-02-21 03:56:03	Justin	doesn't that mean that it's less optimized?
2013-02-21 03:56:30	Phazorx	less implies comparision
2013-02-21 03:56:42	Phazorx	and probably some criteria
2013-02-21 03:56:46	crowe	alright
2013-02-21 03:57:03	crowe	time to recompress all the videos from gothic 1 so they'll display properly
2013-02-21 03:57:04	crowe	fun times
2013-02-21 03:57:07	jotham	that's a difficult question
2013-02-21 03:57:12	crowe	old games are such a riot to fix up :(
2013-02-21 03:57:35	jotham	quite often huge faggot start using C++ and write a worse version of all the algorithms higher level languages are already based on
2013-02-21 03:57:48	jotham	so their program is worse and took longer to write even though its 'lower level'
2013-02-21 03:57:49	Phazorx	Justin: you can say that interpretor language would take more resources of some kind than at complier langugae when it comes to execution
2013-02-21 03:58:20	jotham	python is however exceptionally slow for some tasks, but that isn't a concern for the majority of its uses
2013-02-21 03:58:35	Phazorx	jotham: namely?
2013-02-21 03:58:42	Justin	less optimized to a compiled language like C++
2013-02-21 03:58:58	therealfakemoot	Justin: Not quite
2013-02-21 03:58:59	jotham	using python to iterate of massive bitmaps during CI is worse than using a statically typed language for example even with numpy
2013-02-21 03:59:19	therealfakemoot	Justin: There's a lot of different Python interpeters
2013-02-21 03:59:19	jotham	resolution is always more of a bottleneck in a dynamic language than in a static language
2013-02-21 03:59:24	Phazorx	Justin: generally speaking it probably is less optimized, however correct question would factor in whether it matters
2013-02-21 03:59:26	therealfakemoot	resolution?
2013-02-21 03:59:31	therealfakemoot	What the hell are you talking about jotham
2013-02-21 03:59:31	jotham	scope resolution
2013-02-21 03:59:54	Phazorx	jotham: agreed
2013-02-21 04:00:05	<--	Trifase (trifase@NewNet-73E3D62C.retail.telecomitalia.it) has quit (Trifase)
2013-02-21 04:00:14	jotham	hey i love python, but i wont blow smoke up anyones ass
2013-02-21 04:00:31	Phazorx	however there are advanced data structures which take advantage of low level implementations for graphs, queues, stacks and other similar structures
2013-02-21 04:00:38	therealfakemoot	Quite.
2013-02-21 04:00:39	jotham	yep
2013-02-21 04:00:44	therealfakemoot	Anything that's slow in Python can be written in C.
2013-02-21 04:00:47	jotham	that's what i meant above about the random c+= tard
2013-02-21 04:00:52	jotham	*c++
2013-02-21 04:00:52	therealfakemoot	or run on PyPy
2013-02-21 04:00:56	Justin	hm
2013-02-21 04:01:11	therealfakemoot	C can be slow, Python can be fast
2013-02-21 04:01:14	therealfakemoot	It's all about how you write it
2013-02-21 04:01:14	Justin	PyPy?
2013-02-21 04:01:16	jotham	i have massive terminal latency, it always fucks with my typing, i think it's the rhythm
2013-02-21 04:01:30	therealfakemoot	Justin: It's a Python interpreter written in Python
2013-02-21 04:01:42	Justin	...huh
2013-02-21 04:01:43	jotham	i've written a couple of games in python
2013-02-21 04:01:51	therealfakemoot	Justin: It has a JIT compiler that can do optimizations that have been shown to increase speed by 10x (in some cases)
2013-02-21 04:01:55	Justin	So you're intepreting something using an intepreter that needs to be intepreter?
2013-02-21 04:02:05	Justin	interpreted* for the last one
2013-02-21 04:02:08	therealfakemoot	I don't know how it works, I've never written an interpreter or compiler.
2013-02-21 04:02:11	jotham	the last 3 real commercial uses for python i had was video rendering automation across multiple windows boxes
2013-02-21 04:02:44	jotham	where it being a slow ass language was irrelevant since directshow and ffmpeg did all the lifting
2013-02-21 04:02:45	Phazorx	Justin: in reality dependsing on what you do, some things might take longer to run when programmed in python compared to c, however there are ways to optimize them so they would run almost as fast, and time it takes to code pythong and enfroce optimization is probably less than it would take to code it in C starting from relatively low level of project coplexity
2013-02-21 04:03:23	jotham	worrying about performance is really really in the same territory as asking about *args

2013-02-21 04:03:28	jotham	it fucking does not matter right now
2013-02-21 04:03:30	Phazorx	hence even though it could be suboptimal you should not really care about it
2013-02-21 04:03:55	therealfakemoot	Yeah, the main advantage of Python is the readability/maintainability it gives your code.
2013-02-21 04:04:07	jotham	that's where actionscript is going to kick pythons ass fwiw (re actionscript)
2013-02-21 04:04:13	therealfakemoot	uh
2013-02-21 04:04:27	therealfakemoot	I doubt it.
2013-02-21 04:04:32	Justin	oh dear
2013-02-21 04:04:34	jotham	you get some datatypes for image processing and state permutation that ar very helpful that you can't get without a C extension to python
2013-02-21 04:04:53	Justin	so what is a JIT compiler?
2013-02-21 04:04:53	jotham	agal, bytearray, Vector, etc
2013-02-21 04:05:23	therealfakemoot	Just-In-Time
2013-02-21 04:05:29	Phazorx	Justin: it's a tachnology helping to smartly optimize things real time (while being execurted) to make things work faster automatically
2013-02-21 04:05:32	Justin	:(
2013-02-21 04:05:34	therealfakemoot	It's actively running durring runtime
2013-02-21 04:05:44	Justin	Ooooooh cool!
2013-02-21 04:05:45	Phazorx	you should not worry about JIT at the moment i think
2013-02-21 04:05:46	jotham	type hinting also helps n the static analysis and preprocessing of a language which means you have to be less aware of the deeper costs of your language constructs
2013-02-21 04:05:48	therealfakemoot	i.e. it optimizes code paths as it runs
2013-02-21 04:06:01	therealfakemoot	Justin: So for the right types of code, PyPy can offer powerful speedups
2013-02-21 04:06:05	therealfakemoot	But only for specific types of operations
2013-02-21 04:06:06	Justin	oh JIT is actually called "Just-In-Time"
2013-02-21 04:06:10	Justin	I thought you were making a pun out of my name
2013-02-21 04:06:11	Justin	:(
2013-02-21 04:06:11	therealfakemoot	Not across-the-board
2013-02-21 04:06:22	therealfakemoot	Yeah. Just In Time Compiler
2013-02-21 04:06:22	therealfakemoot	JIT
2013-02-21 04:06:25	therealfakemoot	Java's got one
2013-02-21 04:06:32	Justin	heard of it before
2013-02-21 04:06:44	jotham	you can see jit at work a lot hwen you are profiling
2013-02-21 04:06:48	Justin	anyway uh, doesn't the default Python installation come with python's own intepreter?
2013-02-21 04:07:00	jotham	occasional executions having high cost vs frequent executions of a program branch
2013-02-21 04:07:02	therealfakemoot	That's CPython.
2013-02-21 04:07:07	Justin	CPython?
2013-02-21 04:07:11	therealfakemoot	The 'official' Python release is CPython
2013-02-21 04:07:14	Justin	intepreter programmed in C?
2013-02-21 04:07:18	therealfakemoot	Correct
2013-02-21 04:07:22	Justin	heh
2013-02-21 04:07:22	sandbox	but Justin doesn't compile in time
2013-02-21 04:07:27	jotham	almost all good software is written in C
2013-02-21 04:07:28	therealfakemoot	Then there's Cython
2013-02-21 04:07:30	therealfakemoot	Jython
2013-02-21 04:07:31	therealfakemoot	IronPython
2013-02-21 04:07:46	Justin	Jython being an interpreter written in Java?
2013-02-21 04:07:50	therealfakemoot	Not quite
2013-02-21 04:07:54	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-21 04:08:01	therealfakemoot	Jython compiles Python source code to Java bytecode
2013-02-21 04:08:02	Phazorx	Justin: more liek a way to run python code inside JVM
2013-02-21 04:08:06	therealfakemoot	Meaning you can write Python and run it on the JVM
2013-02-21 04:08:13	therealfakemoot	i.e. anywhere java can run
2013-02-21 04:08:17	Justin	Anyways I suppose CPython and PyPy are pretty straight-forward I suppose
2013-02-21 04:08:20	Justin	therealfakemoot: Oh so
2013-02-21 04:08:28	Justin	it converts python code to java?
2013-02-21 04:08:29	therealfakemoot	ironpython does the same for .net I think
2013-02-21 04:08:37	jotham	the language you program in is many levels away from the final execution sytax in the processor
2013-02-21 04:08:37	therealfakemoot	Justin: Python source to java bytecode
2013-02-21 04:08:50	therealfakemoot	Yeah, there's a few stages code goes through before it can be executed
2013-02-21 04:09:12	Phazorx	Justin: java is precompiled language, java compiler compiles java source to jvm bytecode, jython compile python source to jvm bytecode
2013-02-21 04:09:27	Justin	yeah I know java is a precompiled language
2013-02-21 04:09:46	Justin	so basically jython is the java compiler for python?
2013-02-21 04:09:51	Justin	sounds neat
2013-02-21 04:10:01	therealfakemoot	It's a python bytecode compiler for java
2013-02-21 04:10:05	therealfakemoot	or
2013-02-21 04:10:08	therealfakemoot	for the jvm
2013-02-21 04:10:10	Justin	what's bytecode
2013-02-21 04:10:13	Justin	is it binary?
2013-02-21 04:10:15	therealfakemoot	It's complicated.
2013-02-21 04:10:19	Justin	okay
2013-02-21 04:10:20	therealfakemoot	And nothing you need to worry about.
2013-02-21 04:10:23	Justin	all right
2013-02-21 04:10:24	therealfakemoot	Or, you can read wikipedia.
2013-02-21 04:10:27	Justin	so I'll assume it's magic
2013-02-21 04:10:32	Justin	nah wikipedia's horribly jargon-ized
2013-02-21 04:10:35	therealfakemoot	well, it's not
2013-02-21 04:10:40	Justin	what's not?
2013-02-21 04:10:49	therealfakemoot	Not magic.
2013-02-21 04:11:10	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-21 04:11:22	Justin	so is PyPy an alternative interpreter to CPython
2013-02-21 04:11:26	Justin	or is it a compiler?
2013-02-21 04:11:43	therealfakemoot	It's another interpreter
2013-02-21 04:11:52	Justin	that's better than CPython?
2013-02-21 04:11:55	therealfakemoot	Nope
2013-02-21 04:11:57	therealfakemoot	Different
2013-02-21 04:12:02	Justin	oh okay
2013-02-21 04:12:13	Justin	PyPy sounds weird anyway
2013-02-21 04:12:20	therealfakemoot	The single most important thing you can learn about programming is that there is nothing better than anything else
2013-02-21 04:12:21	Justin	why would you write an interpreter in an interpreted language???
2013-02-21 04:12:27	Justin	right
2013-02-21 04:12:27	therealfakemoot	For the JIT.
2013-02-21 04:12:29	jotham	think of a language as being optimized for human readability and bytecode for machine readability, but it's NOT THE FINAL FORM
2013-02-21 04:12:32	therealfakemoot	For the optimizations it can offer.
2013-02-21 04:12:46	Justin	can't you do JIT with C?
2013-02-21 04:12:54	therealfakemoot	Not as easily as with Python
2013-02-21 04:12:59	Justin	jotham: is the final form for machines binary?
2013-02-21 04:13:07	jotham	final form is a meme joke
2013-02-21 04:13:11	Justin	therealfakemoot: So does PyPy use another interpreter to interpret PyPy?
2013-02-21 04:13:16	Justin	jotham: Never heard of that meme
2013-02-21 04:13:20	therealfakemoot	It interprets itself
2013-02-21 04:13:24	therealfakemoot	or
2013-02-21 04:13:27	Justin	wow that's pretty whacky
2013-02-21 04:13:29	therealfakemoot	Well, read the webpage
2013-02-21 04:13:36	therealfakemoot	They can explain better than me, I don't use it
2013-02-21 04:13:46	Justin	hmm okay
2013-02-21 04:13:50	jotham	pypy is up there with *args
2013-02-21 04:13:53	jotham	more magic shit
2013-02-21 04:14:07	therealfakemoot	why do you keep saying *args
2013-02-21 04:14:11	therealfakemoot	what is that
2013-02-21 04:14:15	Justin	therealfakemoot: we were talking about *args
2013-02-21 04:14:16	Justin	I was confused
2013-02-21 04:14:20	therealfakemoot	Wow
2013-02-21 04:14:21	Justin	so he chalked it all down to magic
2013-02-21 04:14:25	jotham	therealfakemoot: because i know the entire context of this conversation?
2013-02-21 04:14:38	therealfakemoot	I wasn't sure if you were referring to them in the context of Python
2013-02-21 04:14:48	jotham	magic isn't disparaging, just recognising that some things are sufficiently far away from the current information context
2013-02-21 04:14:51	Justin	so when he compares something to *args it's basically him saying to me "DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT"
2013-02-21 04:14:54	therealfakemoot	just making sure I knew where your definiton of 'magic' lay
2013-02-21 04:15:29	Justin	so is bytecode lower than low-level languages or what?
2013-02-21 04:15:34	 *	Phazorx remembers old IBM commercial with pixie dust
2013-02-21 04:15:49	jotham	i had a pretty fun job today
2013-02-21 04:16:13	jotham	i got given an ssh key and an ip to an ec2 machine and no docs and got told it was a book website in german and someones book had expired, and it had been happening more and more
2013-02-21 04:16:22	jotham	i logged in, with basically only that data
2013-02-21 04:16:28	jotham	it was written in c# java and objc
2013-02-21 04:16:36	jotham	i had no access to the Ui as another company controls that
2013-02-21 04:16:48	Justin	sounds fun
2013-02-21 04:16:52	jotham	took about 5 hours to hack a solution since there was no tool chain for compiling any of it

2013-02-21 04:17:11	jotham	yeah i like random ass jobs like that
2013-02-21 04:17:22	Justin	so is bytecode directly readable by machines
2013-02-21 04:17:24	Justin	or is it binary?
2013-02-21 04:17:31	Justin	I was under the impression that it was binary
2013-02-21 04:17:47	jotham	bytecode is a portable language for machines to use before its translated into instructions for the particular processor its sitting on
2013-02-21 04:17:58	-->	Trifase (~trifase@NewNet-1BB5CEB7.retail.telecomitalia.it) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-21 04:17:59	Phazorx	Justin: there were quite a few missconceptions there in that sentence
2013-02-21 04:18:02	jotham	its optimized for them, rather than us
2013-02-21 04:18:35	jotham	because we're fat stupid lolling ilogical beasts
2013-02-21 04:18:41	jotham	and our language needs to involve grunts
2013-02-21 04:19:12	Justin	Phazorx: Or even many ;V
2013-02-21 04:19:27	Trifase	Silvio berlusconi just sent letters to all italians
2013-02-21 04:19:34	Justin	jotham: So it's one of the very last stages of translation?
2013-02-21 04:19:40	Trifase	promising that he will give money from last year taxes
2013-02-21 04:19:44	Trifase	to all who will vote for him
2013-02-21 04:19:59	jotham	depends
2013-02-21 04:20:01	jotham	but yeah
2013-02-21 04:20:02	Trifase	there ia s concrete risk that he will win the elections again next month
2013-02-21 04:20:18	jotham	your language is designed for humans not machines
2013-02-21 04:20:29	jotham	so that has to be parsed and translated into shit that's more convenient for machine
2013-02-21 04:20:37	jotham	+s
2013-02-21 04:20:38	Phazorx	i dont think virtualisation is about humans or mahcines
2013-02-21 04:20:49	jotham	python is absolutely about humans
2013-02-21 04:20:55	crowe	berlusconi e un uomo che avere molto dinero
2013-02-21 04:20:56	Phazorx	it's amere concept of adding an abstaction layer for sake of simple common inetrface
2013-02-21 04:20:57	crowe	is that right?
2013-02-21 04:20:58	jotham	bytecode is absolutely an optimization step
2013-02-21 04:21:01	crowe	i am practice italian
2013-02-21 04:21:22	Justin	yeah I know that all programming languages are designed for humans
2013-02-21 04:21:36	Justin	well, some humans
2013-02-21 04:21:43	jotham	python specifically has an aim to be a psudocode like learning language
2013-02-21 04:21:59	jotham	it's not full of the c-like decoration and flow control nonsense
2013-02-21 04:22:05	jotham	like so many popular languages
2013-02-21 04:22:08	Justin	so uh
2013-02-21 04:22:19	Trifase	MY COUNTRY IS IN DANGER
2013-02-21 04:22:21	jotham	that's why you can say banana is None
2013-02-21 04:22:22	Justin	there are some humans out there that are capable of reading computer language, right?
2013-02-21 04:22:26	Trifase	PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
2013-02-21 04:22:30	jotham	BANANA IS NONE
2013-02-21 04:22:32	jotham	PLZ
2013-02-21 04:22:34	Phazorx	Justin: any java code compiles to bytecode, which then can be run on any JVM (there are multiple implementations) at same time most platforms jabe JVM implementations (particular JVM is developed to run on given hardware)
2013-02-21 04:22:52	Justin	Trifase: That's hilarious
2013-02-21 04:22:56	jotham	programming is for suckers
2013-02-21 04:22:57	Phazorx	that sepration makes it possible for developers of java application to not care at all about hardware where their code will run
2013-02-21 04:23:16	jotham	i think if you meant a young programmer you should brain damage him some how or make him a jock pro athelete
2013-02-21 04:23:22	jotham	so he doesn't become a programmer
2013-02-21 04:23:26	jotham	his life will be better
2013-02-21 04:23:36	Phazorx	Trifase: why you guys dont impich  him like with clinton... he was sleeping with someone he isnt supposed to i think ?
2013-02-21 04:24:01	Justin	he isn't the president in Italy currently
2013-02-21 04:24:04	Justin	strange, I know
2013-02-21 04:24:18	Justin	jotham: Are you brain damaging me
2013-02-21 04:24:23	jotham	i hope so
2013-02-21 04:24:40	Justin	well didn't you say you love programming
2013-02-21 04:24:45	jotham	absolutely
2013-02-21 04:24:51	jotham	but that doesn't mean it's horrible
2013-02-21 04:24:55	jotham	er not horrible
2013-02-21 04:24:59	Justin	???
2013-02-21 04:25:18	Justin	"i think if you meant" who is this "you"????
2013-02-21 04:25:25	jotham	most of the languages and systems i work with are chosen because of businesses and by people who don't even understand the value of the scientific method
2013-02-21 04:25:42	jotham	it's an absolute horror
2013-02-21 04:26:07	<--	sandbox (sandbox@NewNet-2BDB4F55.as43234.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 185 seconds)
2013-02-21 04:26:25	Justin	so what language would you work with
2013-02-21 04:26:27	Justin	if you could choose
2013-02-21 04:26:33	-->	sandbox (sandbox@NewNet-C329868.as43234.net) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-21 04:26:34	jotham	so as a career programmer you willingly enter an occupation where you value all of these things that are absolutely not relevant to the forces providing your income
2013-02-21 04:26:47	 *	Phazorx whispers please dont say haskel
2013-02-21 04:26:49	jotham	so you choose to eat from a source that is against your very education
2013-02-21 04:27:00	jotham	it's an unhealthy life choice
2013-02-21 04:27:10	Trifase	<Phazorx> Trifase: why you guys dont impich  him like with clinton... he was sleeping with someone he isnt supposed to i think ?
2013-02-21 04:27:13	jotham	i like python, but i think it's dying
2013-02-21 04:27:23	Justin	so who were you talking to, jotham
2013-02-21 04:27:23	Trifase	He was in a scandal with some orgy and some not-so-legal girl
2013-02-21 04:27:24	jotham	anyway, the language is irrelevent without the job
2013-02-21 04:27:27	Trifase	And it's a new candidate
2013-02-21 04:27:28	Justin	"i think if you meant"
2013-02-21 04:27:29	Trifase	and it's gaining votes
2013-02-21 04:27:39	Phazorx	jotham: i think you had way to much enterprise experience... that actually is a killjoy of IT
2013-02-21 04:27:42	Trifase	because italians are very stupid
2013-02-21 04:28:08	jotham	Phazorx: very little actually, mostly repairing broken software written by retards
2013-02-21 04:28:19	jotham	i work in advertising these days
2013-02-21 04:28:23	jotham	since there are like no nerds
2013-02-21 04:29:03	jotham	spending your career fixing software written by spastics is the reward you get for being smart enough to do it, but the spastics are always cheaper so they alwayss get hired to make the mess
2013-02-21 04:29:13	jotham	another hilarious part of why programming is bad for your health
2013-02-21 04:30:00	Justin	well why are you complaining about them
2013-02-21 04:30:05	Justin	they're giving you your job, aren't they?
2013-02-21 04:30:13	Justin	if they wrote oh-so-perfect code you wouldn't be there to fix it
2013-02-21 04:30:15	jotham	it's not a complaint
2013-02-21 04:30:17	Justin	:V

2013-02-21 04:30:53	Justin	if you know how to program you're already brain damaged
2013-02-21 04:31:36	jotham	i agree absolutel
2013-02-21 04:32:13	jotham	you spend all day with a system that is almost always right, right oftne enough that you accept you are always wrong, and assumptions and your personal feelings are all retarded, then you go home and have to talk to a human that believes imaginary shit
2013-02-21 04:32:17	jotham	it's hilarious
2013-02-21 04:33:01	jotham	but you have to interact with those people or you get miserable because you've been genetically engineered to be a social fucking animal
2013-02-21 04:33:17	jotham	the whole thing is a giant entertaining disaster

2013-02-21 08:18:48	roushguy	Theoretically speaking
2013-02-21 08:18:56	roushguy	IE what needs to be high and what needs to be low
2013-02-21 08:19:31	AfterShave	High sharpness factor, swing speed and a low contact area are nice I believe
2013-02-21 08:19:37	AfterShave	For weapons
2013-02-21 08:20:06	roushguy	Alright.
2013-02-21 08:20:16	roushguy	Unfortunately, dragonscale isn't so sharp.
2013-02-21 08:20:47	roushguy	It's technically a slag metal that, by some process of the extrusion that forms it, renders it tougher than most metals
2013-02-21 08:20:59	roushguy	Candy would be better than it, for instance.
2013-02-21 08:21:01	roushguy	But it's /HEAVY/
2013-02-21 08:21:22	AfterShave	That scale sounds like, it would be more like a bulbous mass rather than scales
2013-02-21 08:21:24	roushguy	Dragonbone, however, is like obsidian IRL, without the problem of shattering when hit hard

2013-02-21 08:22:38	roushguy	Think of it kind of like your fingernails.
2013-02-21 08:22:40	AfterShave	Or would it? What if it actually (despite you being its creator) keep extruding until the dragon is basically a rock
2013-02-21 08:22:56	roushguy	Then you get a creature like the World-Wyrm.
2013-02-21 08:22:57	AfterShave	I can't relate to my fingernails grinding down
2013-02-21 08:23:06	AfterShave	I bite them off :P
2013-02-21 08:23:25	roushguy	Let them grow out to about an inch
2013-02-21 08:23:33	roushguy	Then press them against one another.
2013-02-21 08:23:36	roushguy	They'll break.
2013-02-21 08:23:43	roushguy	Anyway
2013-02-21 08:23:53	AfterShave	But they're thin
2013-02-21 08:24:00	roushguy	The World-Wyrm, in the idea I have for this fantasy world, is capable of moving only his head.
2013-02-21 08:24:09	roushguy	The rest of him is wrapped around the planet's core.
2013-02-21 08:24:16	roushguy	He's that big.
2013-02-21 08:24:19	AfterShave	This slag would seem to be more like, think of your entire finger growing outward a finger thick nail

2013-02-21 08:25:37	roushguy	It's kind of like how reptiles grow scales IRL. The basic shape is there.
2013-02-21 08:25:46	roushguy	The scales, while small, take on that same shape
2013-02-21 08:26:01	roushguy	Then, thanks to the presence of other scales, keep it as they grow large.
2013-02-21 08:26:41	AfterShave	In my own experience as a pen and paper player/dm. Don't try to explain it
2013-02-21 08:26:42	AfterShave	It just is :P

2013-02-21 08:27:20	roushguy	Anyhow, their bones are also high in metal content
2013-02-21 08:28:00	roushguy	So, while not quite malleable like a bar of iron, they can be heated to become soft, at which point you can sculpt them, with difficulty, into the shape you desire.

2013-02-21 12:52:27	AfterShave	Even though it seems bulkier than an actual helmet
2013-02-21 12:52:50	AfterShave	Also, they're speaking swedish
2013-02-21 12:52:59	sandbox	there was a thing with models in ridiculous clothes trying to make those helmets fashionable or something
2013-02-21 12:53:18	sandbox	I can't say I see many cyclists dressed like that
2013-02-21 12:53:30	AfterShave	I didn't even know they existed

2013-02-21 12:54:12	Soadreqm	Helmets are for wussies.

2013-02-21 12:55:03	AfterShave	It's not all that enforced though
2013-02-21 12:55:18	Soadreqm	They're mandatory in Finland, but it's not very diligently enforced.
2013-02-21 12:55:48	@smeding	they're not mandatory here, and people cycle a lot
2013-02-21 12:56:01	@smeding	helmets are mandatory for mopeds and motorcycles
2013-02-21 12:56:09	AfterShave	Same here
2013-02-21 12:56:12	Soadreqm	I think that no matter where you go, the police always has something better to do than ticket bicyclers.
2013-02-21 12:56:13	sandbox	unless you're a sikh ;p
2013-02-21 12:56:35	AfterShave	Like taking in drunks and patrolling for whatever
2013-02-21 12:56:40	@smeding	Soadreqm: i know plenty of people who have gotten tickets for not using their bike lighting
2013-02-21 12:56:57	@smeding	at night
2013-02-21 12:57:10	Soadreqm	The light's probably more important.
2013-02-21 12:57:26	Soadreqm	Since being invisible can be dangerous for other people, too.
2013-02-21 12:57:31	AfterShave	I have no bike light

2013-02-21 14:09:19	nuthulu	Really, Lord of the rings is a book about how a black guy rallies the misunderstood races of a world to rise up, yet is devilishly defeated by an alliance of white supremacists. Then when he tries to get a piece of jewellery back he's stopped by an alliance of white supremacists and little people
2013-02-21 14:10:05	nuthulu	I mean sure Goblins do some nasty stuff but that doesn't mean you can just slaughter them

2013-02-21 14:27:00	nuthulu	They used up all the resources to fuck over everyone else
2013-02-21 14:27:36	|SL|	IIRC it was more because humans were reproducing far more rapidly and elves were losing their power or something
2013-02-21 14:28:02	|SL|	and it took one of the rings of power to keep Lothlorien intact
2013-02-21 14:28:13	|SL|	and those stopped working after Sauron was defeated

2013-02-21 14:28:41	nuthulu	See, Sauron was keeping the world intact
2013-02-21 14:28:44	RPharazon|NB	The elves kind of do die of old age
2013-02-21 14:28:55	RPharazon|NB	Or rather, they get bored after living a few thousand years without any scientific advances
2013-02-21 14:29:16	RPharazon|NB	On a less facetious note, they do get bored and tired of life
2013-02-21 14:29:22	RPharazon|NB	And all that sadness kind of makes them suicidal
2013-02-21 14:29:36	RPharazon|NB	So they either go to Heavenly Florida or they lay down and die
2013-02-21 14:30:05	RPharazon|NB	There are tons of cases of old and young elves just going "fuck this shit I'm out", laying down somewhere, and dying of their own will
2013-02-21 14:30:32	RPharazon|NB	But technically elves can't die so they just go to, like, Purgatory
2013-02-21 14:30:45	BoogtehWoog	Halls of Mandos!
2013-02-21 14:30:50	RPharazon|NB	Where one of the Valar basically just watches over them for thousands and thousands of years
2013-02-21 14:30:55	BoogtehWoog	Where their spirits are reformed and sent back to Heavenly Florida.
2013-02-21 14:31:00	RPharazon|NB	Until Melkor comes back and they have a big battle and then a second world is made
2013-02-21 14:31:06	BoogtehWoog	amen
2013-02-21 14:31:10	RPharazon|NB	Quite so
2013-02-21 14:31:21	RPharazon|NB	Well, only a few have their spirits reformed
2013-02-21 14:31:32	RPharazon|NB	Those who choose to really
2013-02-21 14:31:40	RPharazon|NB	But most of them are just so tired of living that they choose not to come back
2013-02-21 14:31:53	BoogtehWoog	Well, not to go to Valinor.
2013-02-21 14:31:54	RPharazon|NB	I think there's like two or three cases of coming back to life happening
2013-02-21 14:32:01	RPharazon|NB	One of them is Finduilas
2013-02-21 14:32:01	BoogtehWoog	Wait
2013-02-21 14:32:14	RPharazon|NB	Another one was one of Feanor's half-brothers I think
2013-02-21 14:32:25	RPharazon|NB	Wait, not Finduilas
2013-02-21 14:32:32	RPharazon|NB	That one dude who saved Frodo in the books

2013-02-21 14:32:50	BoogtehWoog	Glorfindel?
2013-02-21 14:33:53	RPharazon|NB	I think so
2013-02-21 14:34:03	RPharazon|NB	Who basically came back to life through Tolkien's forgetfulness
2013-02-21 14:34:27	RPharazon|NB	Since Tolkien was all like "Elven names are important and they get used only once ever for the same person"
2013-02-21 14:34:36	BoogtehWoog	How the hell did I remember that?
2013-02-21 14:34:43	BoogtehWoog	:3
2013-02-21 14:34:49	RPharazon|NB	And someone mailed him saying "But there's like two people, one of them dead, with the same name"
2013-02-21 14:34:57	RPharazon|NB	And he's like "I guess they're the same person then lol"
2013-02-21 14:35:12	BoogtehWoog	lulz tolkien
2013-02-21 14:35:17	BoogtehWoog	or should I say Tolked

2013-02-21 14:36:31	BoogtehWoog	But I think all Elves go back to Valinor whether they want to or not after they die.
2013-02-21 14:36:40	BoogtehWoog	Since that is their destiny.
2013-02-21 14:36:41	RPharazon|NB	Yes
2013-02-21 14:36:46	RPharazon|NB	They live in purgatory even after death
2013-02-21 14:36:57	BoogtehWoog	'Purgatory.'
2013-02-21 14:37:00	BoogtehWoog	Since it is actually pretty nice.
2013-02-21 14:37:00	RPharazon|NB	Which is why they're all jealous and shit of humans who die quickly and don't spend time in purgatory
2013-02-21 14:37:07	RPharazon|NB	Well, it depends
2013-02-21 14:37:14	RPharazon|NB	They go to the Halls of Mandos, not Valinor proper
2013-02-21 14:37:24	BoogtehWoog	Don't they get sent back to Valinor?
2013-02-21 14:37:28	RPharazon|NB	Nay
2013-02-21 14:37:30	RPharazon|NB	Halls of Mandos
2013-02-21 14:37:30	BoogtehWoog	I thought they did.
2013-02-21 14:37:32	RPharazon|NB	Nay
2013-02-21 14:37:34	BoogtehWoog	well, dat sucks, n00bs.
2013-02-21 14:37:35	RPharazon|NB	I decree this to be so
2013-02-21 14:37:47	RPharazon|NB	It's not a bad place
2013-02-21 14:37:50	RPharazon|NB	But it's not Valinor
2013-02-21 14:37:55	BoogtehWoog	Yeah, I could imagine worse.
2013-02-21 14:37:56	RPharazon|NB	It's just kind of buried underneath it sort of
2013-02-21 14:38:51	RPharazon|NB	It's like
2013-02-21 14:38:54	RPharazon|NB	Orlando
2013-02-21 14:38:59	RPharazon|NB	Or some sort of time-share in Florida
2013-02-21 14:39:02	RPharazon|NB	Not quite Florida
2013-02-21 14:39:10	RPharazon|NB	Just blandly warm
2013-02-21 14:39:59	BoogtehWoog	hah

2013-02-21 14:54:28	RPharazon|NB	It was weird
2013-02-21 14:54:50	RPharazon|NB	Cause it was like "yay we lived through the Civil War" and there were two massive world wars looming on the horizon

2013-02-21 14:57:02	sandbox	how many later wars were caused by the actions of WWI?
2013-02-21 14:57:11	RPharazon|NB	Either that or if they were even more hilariously revanchist
2013-02-21 14:57:27	RPharazon|NB	Pretty much all European and Middle Eastern wars
2013-02-21 14:57:44	RPharazon|NB	Thanks to the collapse of Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire
2013-02-21 14:58:05	RPharazon|NB	Europe and the Middle East were embroiled in wars for the next like 5-10 years depending on the region
2013-02-21 14:58:20	RPharazon|NB	Except for France, the UK, and Germany, so you never hear about the other wars

2013-02-21 14:59:59	RPharazon|NB	All those countries were embroiled in civil, revolutionary, or territorial wars from 1918 to around 1930

2013-02-21 15:00:31	sandbox	I think that was probably the last time they were able to go anywhere, due to ill health in their latter years

2013-02-21 15:01:20	nuthulu	I don't know, he seemed to be intent on destroying the monarchies of Europe, by making himself grand emperor of the universe
2013-02-21 15:01:23	RPharazon|NB	The lesson is that French people cause problems whenever they aren't either completely peaceful or completely imperialist
2013-02-21 15:01:35	sandbox	and those of you who have problems with the metric system can blame Napoleon too ;p
2013-02-21 15:01:55	RPharazon|NB	Napoleon was a freedom-hating communist muslim heathen who is unamerican
2013-02-21 15:02:06	nuthulu	He was also Corsican

2013-02-21 15:03:36	nuthulu	Tahiti
2013-02-21 15:03:57	nuthulu	It basically lets you just watch the game play out without you having to do anything, it's kind of neat to see how the AI is crazy.
2013-02-21 15:04:25	RPharazon|NB	Too bad the rest of the mod is shit
2013-02-21 15:04:27	nuthulu	Like Bulgaria conquering Byzantium and the timurids getting armies into Novgorod despite there being two huge countries between them
2013-02-21 15:05:21	RPharazon|NB	The mod was decent until the main dev gave up on telling all the historically-incompetent retards on the Paradox forums to fuck off and die
2013-02-21 15:05:43	nuthulu	But you can form the Jagiellion empire!
2013-02-21 15:05:49	RPharazon|NB	Then it fell victim to the "more features and changes = more better" and "make X country overpowered as fuck because my revanchist and revisionist history deems it so" traps
2013-02-21 15:05:59	nuthulu	That's not even a thing!
2013-02-21 15:06:15	RPharazon|NB	Are you saying that Poland was ever weak
2013-02-21 15:06:25	RPharazon|NB	Are you saying that Poland wasn't master of the universe and saviour of the human race
2013-02-21 15:06:47	RPharazon|NB	Because I will debate you using poorly-spelled mangled sentences
2013-02-21 15:07:07	nuthulu	At least it isn't as bad as that steppe wolf mod where Bulgaria gets 9/9/9 leaders
2013-02-21 15:07:11	nuthulu	And is obscenely powerful
2013-02-21 15:07:26	sandbox	Polish is the second most spoken language in the UK now
2013-02-21 15:07:31	nuthulu	Said mod also goes from like 20 AD to..I think even modern times

2013-02-21 15:08:28	nuthulu	Britain
2013-02-21 15:08:38	nuthulu	So we build polish cafes around his minecraft houses

2013-02-21 15:21:52	RPharazon|NB	No
2013-02-21 15:22:01	RPharazon|NB	You know times are usual when EA starts laying off
2013-02-21 15:22:09	nuthulu	They'll probably turn up dead in a few days
2013-02-21 15:22:14	nuthulu	For knowing to much about EA
2013-02-21 15:22:25	sandbox	under different circumstances than the usual
2013-02-21 15:22:50	sandbox	getting a studio dissolved is the usual
2013-02-21 15:23:00	RPharazon|NB	Their entire business strategy is to buy up developers, tell them to bust out a shit shovelware game based on either a franchise from 15 years ago or a movie, give them 5 months to develop it, and then liquidate the developer wholesale when the game doesn't make 5 million sales in the first week
2013-02-21 15:23:20	-->	roushguy (~Kacy@NewNet-822AF0F.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined #Bay12Games
2013-02-21 15:24:04	nuthulu	"Hmm Bioware, you've done well so far, now complete TOR, Dragon age 2 and Mass effect 3 in five minutes"
2013-02-21 15:24:40	nuthulu	"What's that? ME3 was the end of the trilogy, NONSENSE. PREPARE GARRUS KINECT DANCE SPINOFF."
2013-02-21 15:25:16	roushguy	Speak not of EA, for its ears are everywhere!
2013-02-21 15:25:19	nuthulu	"Hello Maxis, I heard you were developing a game called Spore that might have some potential. IT MUST PLEASE ALL NOW."
2013-02-21 15:25:28	roushguy	Aw man
2013-02-21 15:25:31	roushguy	I remember Spore
2013-02-21 15:25:34	nuthulu	"Syndicate? Why that game would be perfect FOR A RTS."
2013-02-21 15:25:34	roushguy	I never got to play
2013-02-21 15:25:52	roushguy	But someone I know said it was almost kinda like a REALLY watered-down DF
2013-02-21 15:25:53	nuthulu	The creators were kind of fun
2013-02-21 15:25:57	Nemoder	the creature creator was free.  and it was the only good part of the game
2013-02-21 15:26:01	nuthulu	The actual gameplay sucked
2013-02-21 15:26:08	roushguy	Ah.
2013-02-21 15:26:29	RPharazon|NB	"Hey Maxis, I heard that you had an old game franchise called Simcity back in the day, with a complex and in-depth simulation of cities. Make a new one but casualize it so that the Facebook demographic can play it!"
2013-02-21 15:26:51	nuthulu	Also i'm not even sure if Syndicate was EA
2013-02-21 15:26:56	nuthulu	but might as well blame them
2013-02-21 15:28:00	nuthulu	"This MMO can't possibly fail, it's subscription based, has WoW esque combat and it's ran like North Korea" *TOR sales disappointment,game failing* "You're all fired bioware!"
2013-02-21 15:28:04	RPharazon|NB	"Hey Westwood, I know you guys were one of the first to cement modern RTS format gameplay, go we're going to make you develop an FPS. By the way, you have 7 months to do it!"
2013-02-21 15:28:07	sandbox	bullfrog, remember them
2013-02-21 15:28:27	RPharazon|NB	"Hey Westwood, your FPS bombed so we're liquidating you and turning you into EA Los Angeles! You don't get to have C&C anymore."
2013-02-21 15:28:39	AfterShave	Renegade right?
2013-02-21 15:28:43	nuthulu	I'm seriously waiting for them to crush Bioware though
2013-02-21 15:28:43	RPharazon|NB	Yes
2013-02-21 15:28:58	AfterShave	I want a new C&C fps
2013-02-21 15:29:02	nuthulu	I mean with the ME3/DA2/TOR shit that went down it's only a matter of time
2013-02-21 15:29:03	AfterShave	A truly awesome one
2013-02-21 15:29:13	roushguy	EA wants its subsidiaries to release shovelware games like its shitty sports games
2013-02-21 15:29:17	Nemoder	this must be how people who loved theater felt after hollywood took off

2013-02-21 15:29:33	RPharazon|NB	Westwood wanted to make Renegade an RTS and FPS mix, kind of like single-player Natural Selection or single-player Nuclear Dawn. EA made them make a pure FPS and then cut down funding and gave them tiny tiny spaces of time to do it.
2013-02-21 15:29:36	AfterShave	I wonder how many "subscribe" to the EA sportgames
2013-02-21 15:29:54	RPharazon|NB	Then EA made Westwood develop another FPS, but then cancelled it when they finished liquidating Westwood
2013-02-21 15:30:24	AfterShave	Didn't know that part
2013-02-21 15:30:33	AfterShave	Sidenote though
2013-02-21 15:30:46	AfterShave	Nuclear Dawn, good or not you say?
2013-02-21 15:31:00	RPharazon|NB	Nuclear Dawn was fine for a while
2013-02-21 15:31:06	AfterShave	I've peeked at it, but a peek doesn't give much to work with
2013-02-21 15:31:16	sandbox	this is what I get for my randomness
2013-02-21 15:31:26	RPharazon|NB	Then the dev fucked up the balance and the playerbase turned into xX420XxXn05c0p3Xx idiots
2013-02-21 15:31:58	AfterShave	I see
2013-02-21 15:32:17	RPharazon|NB	Now it's like the UT playerbase where you're either really, really, really insanely good and you know the game inside and out, or you just stand there getting killed seconds after spawning
2013-02-21 15:32:26	roushguy	There is exactly one sports game I like
2013-02-21 15:32:37	sandbox	remember those obscure devs that made The Lost Vikings and Rock n' Roll Racing?
2013-02-21 15:32:44	roushguy	And that is Madden 95 for the Sega
2013-02-21 15:32:49	RPharazon|NB	Blizzard?
2013-02-21 15:33:11	sandbox	yeah blizzard but it was silicon and synapse back then or something
2013-02-21 15:33:51	RPharazon|NB	I remember buying Starcraft in like 1999 and getting a pamphlet advertising the next Lost Vikings game
2013-02-21 15:33:51	roushguy	Man.
2013-02-21 15:33:55	roushguy	As bad as Blizz is...
2013-02-21 15:34:03	roushguy	It's probably one of the better game-makers.
2013-02-21 15:34:23	RPharazon|NB	You know what
2013-02-21 15:34:27	roushguy	I mean
2013-02-21 15:34:34	RPharazon|NB	Activision and later Actiblizzard were once really, really vilified
2013-02-21 15:34:37	RPharazon|NB	Like, in 2008 and 2009
2013-02-21 15:34:51	roushguy	Starcraft was popular for years
2013-02-21 15:34:52	RPharazon|NB	Then the rest of the industry saw Actiblizzard and decided that they wanted to be even more evil
2013-02-21 15:35:01	AfterShave	Starcraft is still popular isn't it?
2013-02-21 15:35:05	RPharazon|NB	Now Actiblizzard isn't so evil -purely because the rest of the industry is even more evil-
2013-02-21 15:35:11	AfterShave	I mean, I play it at school every now and then during breaks
2013-02-21 15:35:19	roushguy	Yes
2013-02-21 15:35:22	RPharazon|NB	Actiblizzard did not become less evil, they just became more evil at a slower pace than the rest of the industry
2013-02-21 15:35:27	roushguy	But now there's Starcraft 2
2013-02-21 15:35:37	roushguy	There's also Warcraft.
2013-02-21 15:35:48	roushguy	Which created the MMO that sets the scale
2013-02-21 15:35:56	AfterShave	I know warcraft
2013-02-21 15:35:56	roushguy	And spawned the MOBA games of today.
2013-02-21 15:36:02	sandbox	I only really like warcraft up to 2
2013-02-21 15:36:05	AfterShave	I played a lot of WC2
2013-02-21 15:36:07	AfterShave	When I was younger
2013-02-21 15:36:13	AfterShave	I loved the box it came in
2013-02-21 15:36:16	AfterShave	Awesome art I thought
2013-02-21 15:36:22	sandbox	that was great making custom maps for 2
2013-02-21 15:36:33	RPharazon|NB	Spawning MOBA games is not a good thing
2013-02-21 15:36:37	RPharazon|NB	If anything that's a detractor
2013-02-21 15:36:54	AfterShave	Whaat
2013-02-21 15:36:58	AfterShave	I'm playing a MOBA right now
2013-02-21 15:36:59	RPharazon|NB	MOBA games and their userbases are some of the most poisonous, vile, awful places on the internet

2013-02-21 15:37:08	sandbox	all those offshoots were my least favourite parts

2013-02-21 15:37:15	roushguy	Well
2013-02-21 15:37:18	AfterShave	I must say LoL is nicest
2013-02-21 15:37:20	roushguy	I like LoL
2013-02-21 15:37:23	roushguy	I fucking LOVE LoL
2013-02-21 15:37:28	AfterShave	After level 30 especially
2013-02-21 15:37:33	AfterShave	Which makes it like

2013-02-21 15:37:35	AfterShave	100 games to decency
2013-02-21 15:37:39	roushguy	True
2013-02-21 15:38:01	roushguy	You have to put up with a handful of truly retarded players, but then you hit 30 and you're pretty good
2013-02-21 15:38:14	roushguy	Even moreso with their new honor system

2013-02-21 19:21:53	maddwarf	Well, if nothing else can be done... The said beast seems to be currently encamped just outside my drawbridge, and is taking potshots at the swarming hordes of dwarves who seem to deem it necessary to run around in blind panic outside, rather than hiding indoors. (A small side point of note would be the active goblin siege)

2013-02-21 19:28:50	roushguy	I don't remember military commands

2013-02-21 19:30:05	Zackariah	maddwarf: Make a burrow covering the inside of your fortress. Then go to your alerts and make a new alert. Assign the burrow you made to that alert. You can then assign civilians to that alert whenever a siege comes and they'll run inside

2013-02-22 02:05:10	roushguy	Oh! Captain! I have a question you might be able to answer
2013-02-22 02:05:21	Captain	yes?
2013-02-22 02:05:28	roushguy	Is it possible to have a creature grow scales of metal that drop on its death?
2013-02-22 02:05:47	Captain	yyyyyyessss
2013-02-22 02:05:55	Captain	well
2013-02-22 02:06:07	roushguy	I need the scales to be usable for smelting.
2013-02-22 02:06:15	Captain	you can have a creature grow scales of metal that are cut from it at a butchery
2013-02-22 02:06:26	roushguy	That'll work.
2013-02-22 02:06:30	Captain	I'm not certain you could smelt them that way
2013-02-22 02:06:35	roushguy	Hmm.
2013-02-22 02:06:52	Captain	and I believe that when you cause it to 'drop something' on death
2013-02-22 02:06:57	Captain	that's all you get of it
2013-02-22 02:07:05	Captain	no other corpse bits
2013-02-22 02:07:10	roushguy	That would be... unpleasant.
2013-02-22 02:07:26	roushguy	I wonder if you can melt down metallic bits.
2013-02-22 02:07:39	roushguy	Can you melt down a bronze colossus' arms/legs/head?
2013-02-22 02:07:43	Captain	no
2013-02-22 02:07:56	Captain	um, the reason for that
2013-02-22 02:08:03	Captain	is because they are treated as tissues
2013-02-22 02:08:05	Captain	rather than materials
2013-02-22 02:08:08	Captain	is my guess

2013-02-22 02:08:22	Captain	while the 'statue' that gets dropped
2013-02-22 02:08:25	Captain	is basically a hack
2013-02-22 02:08:26	roushguy	So I'm going to need a custom workshop in there somewhere.
2013-02-22 02:08:42	Captain	well, a custom job of some kind, yes
2013-02-22 02:08:57	roushguy	To 'smelt' the scales into wafers of the metal.
2013-02-22 02:09:02	roushguy	hmm.
2013-02-22 02:09:05	Captain	Lofn would probably be more helpful with the reactions

2013-02-22 02:09:49	Captain	It's been a while since I've worked on the mod
2013-02-22 02:09:55	Captain	Been a while since I've played DF for that matter
2013-02-22 02:09:58	Captain	been doing other things
2013-02-22 02:10:10	roushguy	I know, just getting that technical issue out of the way now.
2013-02-22 02:10:24	roushguy	I freely support anyone using my stuff in their mods.
2013-02-22 02:10:26	roushguy	:D
2013-02-22 02:10:39	Captain	heh, it's okay, I'm mainly waiting for DF to be somewhat more completed before I begin caring about it again
2013-02-22 02:10:44	roushguy	Right.
2013-02-22 02:10:54	Captain	I kinda wish more people would use VBASE in their mods
2013-02-22 02:11:06	roushguy	My idea is basically that dragons only need heat to survive.
2013-02-22 02:11:07	Captain	the regular body templates in vanilla are just
2013-02-22 02:11:08	Captain	awful
2013-02-22 02:11:23	roushguy	I'm thinking I /will/ use the LL stuff to do it.
2013-02-22 02:11:39	roushguy	I remember your creatures being much more understandable.
2013-02-22 02:11:39	Captain	yeah, definitely use it.
2013-02-22 02:11:54	Captain	it's good for reasons way beyond that.
2013-02-22 02:11:58	roushguy	As dragons only need heat, they tend to swim in magma.
2013-02-22 02:12:09	roushguy	They drink it, and exude excess metal as scales.
2013-02-22 02:12:25	roushguy	Something in the process causes it to become far tougher than the slag it would otherwise be.
2013-02-22 02:13:16	Captain	well, the body might well refine it
2013-02-22 02:13:33	roushguy	Their bones are also highly metallic, and, when heated, can be sculpted into weaponry, before being tempered. Once tempered, they're essentially candy sharp with a lot more weight.
2013-02-22 02:13:44	roushguy	Right.
2013-02-22 02:13:59	roushguy	It's a combination of the dragon's digestive system and their actual hide.
2013-02-22 02:14:19	Captain	naturally this is just fluff, since you can't build that sort of stuff into the game.
2013-02-22 02:14:27	roushguy	Right.
2013-02-22 02:14:35	Captain	well, you /might/ be able to specify the reactions
2013-02-22 02:14:36	roushguy	I'm going to add two new 'metals'
2013-02-22 02:14:41	Captain	I'm not well acquainted with them though
2013-02-22 02:15:07	roushguy	Dragonscale slag and dragonsteel.
2013-02-22 02:15:23	Captain	hmmmmmmm
2013-02-22 02:15:27	Captain	you could create a custom tissue
2013-02-22 02:15:31	Captain	and give it a custom reaction
2013-02-22 02:15:36	Captain	to allow it to be melted down
2013-02-22 02:15:46	roushguy	Like it was a metal?
2013-02-22 02:15:50	Captain	so that you'd be able to produce it from corpses
2013-02-22 02:16:00	Captain	well, it'd be a reaction, you'd probably have it at a smelter
2013-02-22 02:16:06	roushguy	True.
2013-02-22 02:16:13	Captain	that would work, fairly sure

2013-02-22 02:17:04	Captain	eh, worst that'll happen is that it flat out won't work
2013-02-22 02:17:16	Captain	my suggestion is to test putting the tissue on pigs or something

2013-02-22 02:25:06	Spekkio	Seems like the most interesting thing is having the (extremely smooth) glass surface on the bottom

2013-02-22 02:26:57	Spekkio	so I'm thinking that you'd get a more practical, similar board if you made it largely out of a transparent plastic and then put a thin layer of glass on the bottom
2013-02-22 02:27:13	Spekkio	thinner meaning that it can withstand more bending without cracking, hopefully
2013-02-22 02:35:27	roushguy	Hmm
2013-02-22 02:35:35	Spekkio	it's probably still a bad idea and you'd do better looking for other ways to get that super-smooth surface.
2013-02-22 02:35:38	roushguy	Glass doesn't act like a lot of other things though.
2013-02-22 02:35:59	roushguy	You might want to try slats of glass.
2013-02-22 02:38:04	Spekkio	Basically I don't like the idea of using glass at all. If a bit comes off on the snow (if you were using a thin glass layer) it might be practically impossible to find it, then it's a bad cut waiting to happen to someone else

2013-02-22 09:02:53	nuthulu	As a discussion I confirm
2013-02-22 09:02:54	sandbox	I thought he was talking about the scripting

2013-02-22 09:03:30	@smeding	Justin: and yeah i know

2013-02-22 09:03:36	@smeding	it's a dumb discussion too

2013-02-22 09:03:44	Justin	there are so many discussions
2013-02-22 09:03:49	Justin	no idea
2013-02-22 09:03:51	@smeding	"i wrote some python once"
2013-02-22 09:03:55	Justin	that's me
2013-02-22 09:03:58	sandbox	how the events in the game aren't 'planned'
2013-02-22 09:04:03	@smeding	have you even written python
2013-02-22 09:04:09	@smeding	last i saw you were looking at the import statement
2013-02-22 09:04:19	Justin	smeding: I jest
2013-02-22 09:04:25	@smeding	sandbox: oh? that would be interesting

2013-02-22 09:04:40	sandbox	and that random pedestrian he decides to follow gets mugged just by chance...
2013-02-22 09:04:56	Justin	basically fenrif suspects that the game events are scripted, but puts a disclaimer saying he isn't a programmer, then someone says something completely unrelated
2013-02-22 09:04:58	nuthulu	Smeding he's half code
2013-02-22 09:05:05	Justin	how can you even do that
2013-02-22 09:05:17	sandbox	it seems fairly artificial looking at it a second time
2013-02-22 09:05:24	Justin	I'm pretty sure fenrif stated his point clearly
2013-02-22 09:05:27	Justin	so...???
2013-02-22 09:05:28	nuthulu	Justin as a partial psychologist it's clear that he's actually you know you can make napalm with orange juice and ice
2013-02-22 09:05:31	sandbox	I saw it a few days ago
2013-02-22 09:06:07	Justin	"I'm not a programer, but I assume there's a huge difference between having NPCs pull up a 1 line text description from a database and having a hundred or so AI processes all running simultaniously and reacting to various stimuli."
2013-02-22 09:06:15	Justin	"As a partial programmer, I can tell you now that programmers are often lazy, and will develop a system that could easily be hacked by the bored cracker on his day to day basis."
2013-02-22 09:06:17	Justin	???????
2013-02-22 09:06:38	nuthulu	As a bored cracker, please put some butter on me
2013-02-22 09:06:52	Justin	to add to the hilarity someone confused between zebio and fenrif
2013-02-22 09:06:54	sandbox	cream cheese
2013-02-22 09:06:55	Justin	was confused*
2013-02-22 09:07:55	@smeding	but yeah, i mean
2013-02-22 09:08:03	@smeding	traffic lights already have transponders for emergency services
2013-02-22 09:08:19	@smeding	it would save money to make that a standard protocol like zigbee or whatever
