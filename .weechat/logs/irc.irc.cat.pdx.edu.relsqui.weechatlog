2014-11-04 11:05:59	sabreman	how do you do your color codes?
2014-11-04 11:07:38	relsqui	I have a script, I don't remember the actual commands. ^C maybe?
2014-11-04 11:07:42	relsqui	would have to look it up in the docs
2014-11-04 11:21:08	sabreman	If you have an opportunity could you? I wanna use colors too :P 
2014-11-04 11:21:17	sabreman	Or link me to the script and i'll look it up myself
2014-11-04 11:21:35	relsqui	just google irssi color codes?
2014-11-04 11:21:47	relsqui	rtfm
2014-11-04 11:21:50	sabreman	k
2014-11-04 11:22:03	sabreman	i dont use irssi so i hd no idea if there was a special thing for it.
2014-11-04 11:22:42	relsqui	oh, well, s/irssi/your client/ then
2014-11-04 11:22:55	relsqui	and I am even *less* use to you
2014-11-04 11:24:06	sabreman	well, i can see the colors when you use them, so i assumed the same codes where used on both clients
2014-11-04 11:24:09	sabreman	hence the question
2014-11-04 11:24:44	relsqui	yes, but I have no idea what your client's UI is for them
2014-11-04 11:24:52	relsqui	especially since I don't even remember what *my* client's UI is for them
2014-11-04 11:25:52	sabreman
