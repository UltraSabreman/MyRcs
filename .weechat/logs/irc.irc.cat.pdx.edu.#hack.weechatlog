2014-10-18 09:38:39	Fox	I know how to do that from my laptop, but I don't know how to do it with our lab computers.
2014-10-18 09:42:34	Fox	Doing it through the control panel -> connect to a projector doesn't seem to change it.

2014-10-18 14:03:58	Fox	They should, if the computer recognizes that they're plugged in. Trying to change the system volume was prompting for admin rights.

2014-10-18 14:05:06	Fox	I have too, that's why I'm remarking it's weird; in fact, I was this morning... but a few of the computers in EB 325 East aren't recognizing them.
2014-10-18 14:06:49	pfaffle	guess we will have to look into that on monday

2014-10-20 08:30:50	mancat	he's using some proprietary web platform that seems to choke and die halfway through the download.

2014-10-20 10:47:32	Fox	You could try the Windows troubleshooter. One of the only things it can correctly diagnose tends to be Wi-fi issues...
2014-10-20 10:49:33	Aatrox	i suggested trying to connect in another location, and also OIT
2014-10-20 10:53:41	Aatrox	also, when solo-desking, should i do printer checks or keep the desk open?
2014-10-20 10:56:54	Fox	This time of year, you should leave it for the 2 people coming after you, because Fall is busy...
2014-10-20 10:57:03	Fox	Other times of year it's generally ok to close desk for labchecks.

2014-10-21 12:40:39	stormcrow	wrabble: arduinos can be a little finicky to set up, but I managed to get them working. Unfortunately, it might be that htye have to go searching around online or crawling through the github project for the IDE to find one that will work. I remember that there was a bug in the stable version that required using the nightly on linux, but that was over a year ago
2014-10-21 12:40:57	 *	stacybird "borrows" another cube-mousepad for washing
2014-10-21 12:41:46	wrabble	stormcrow: Alright, cool. User had limited time so I directed him to his teacher or fellow students, but good to know for the future.
2014-10-21 12:45:30	stormcrow	wrabble: also, if he comes back, emphasize searching "arduino mac", "arduino apple", or something similar to those. Hobbyist things like Arduinos will take more self-directed searching than the average school project.
2014-10-21 12:46:16	stormcrow	(btw, did he mention who assigned the Arduino project?)
2014-10-21 12:46:35	pfaffle	wintel is off on an excursion to SB2
2014-10-21 12:46:42	pfaffle	wish us luck
2014-10-21 12:48:36	wrabble	stormcrow: It seemed his teacher, his teacher was actually the one that directed him here saying he coudn't figure it out.
2014-10-21 12:49:25	wrabble	And the teacher said if we couldn't figure it out to talk to someone else who had taught "that project" before him, so i'm hoping he will be headed towards a professional arduino problem solver

2014-10-24 08:43:43	Corax	User is having problems with an outside web page/domain not loading from PSU IP addresses, while still loading fine from outside IP addresses.
2014-10-24 08:44:38	Corax	If I understand right, that does NOT qualify as a 'web-based issue' so would be Networking flag, not Web flag? And also, do WE block any domains, or is that all OIT's thing?
2014-10-24 08:45:36	Corax	'WEB' flag would be for problems with web pages *we* host, yes?
2014-10-24 08:50:40	Corax	I checked the pages referred to, and can confirm they load on my phone under cellular data connection, but not under PSU Secure or on Scissors. I can't really access a PSU-But-Not-CECS desktop to be entirely thorough.
2014-10-24 08:52:20	tamgc	nothing should be blocked web-wise, is there a specific URL?
2014-10-24 08:54:17	tamgc	(current guess is DNS...)
2014-10-24 09:01:37	Corax	Anything under https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ .
2014-10-24 09:02:55	Corax	It gives an ERR_TIMED_OUT error, not a lack of DNS error.
2014-10-24 09:03:10	Corax	And can't even ping it.
2014-10-24 09:04:27	tamgc	hmm, that pulled up just fine here in UTS

2014-10-24 11:16:10	pfaffle	just maybe card access
2014-10-24 11:16:12	Corax	You mean EE? She switched *from* ETM.

2014-10-24 11:16:39	pfaffle	sec
2014-10-24 11:16:44	Corax	And would we have to change her major in crack to alter card access, or do we point her to EB100?
2014-10-24 11:17:06	pfaffle	re: her account
2014-10-24 11:17:22	pfaffle	when she registers for an EE class, she will have an ECE account that we need to validate
2014-10-24 11:17:33	pfaffle	(she is only currently registered for an ETM class, apparently)
2014-10-24 11:17:42	pfaffle	but there is nothing to do right now
2014-10-24 11:18:10	pfaffle	re: card access, EB 100 should handle it
2014-10-24 11:18:35	pfaffle	but i am not sure if they'll do it until she registers, once again
2014-10-24 11:18:58	Corax	Okay, she got special approval yesterday for a couple EE classes that aren't showing in crack, but are on the Banner end.
2014-10-24 11:19:05	pfaffle	ah, ok
2014-10-24 11:19:16	pfaffle	well shit. guess i need to figure out how to do bannersuck then.

2014-10-24 12:39:21	snap	Sorry for the confusion bajr! I was here by myself and that group came over from the tutor's lounge.

2014-10-24 13:50:34	snap	cliffy: He did do that actually. This is the second time we have reset his profile. After the first didn't work we contacted him via email telling him to log out and reboot his box before he came in, which he did.

2014-10-25 12:06:25	dom	Golem: a lot of tickets went by the wayside due to lack of deskcats I think

2014-10-25 13:52:20	BallotStuffer	Sweet. I wasn't sure if we would have time for all that.
2014-10-25 13:52:44	BallotStuffer	So is someone looking at NagioBot and how it's freaking out?
2014-10-25 13:53:51	dom	its a saturday, so probably not

2014-10-25 14:04:05	thyme	:?
2014-10-25 14:04:11	Golem	We experiancing a systemic shutdown of all lab computers that were not currently in use
2014-10-25 14:04:32	bajr	o.O
2014-10-25 14:04:32	thyme	probably scheduled downtime if askore kicked nagiosbot
2014-10-25 14:04:52	Golem	Perhaps, but its locked us and everone out of every lab computer
2014-10-25 14:05:02	dom	thyme: except we wouldn't schedule downtime in the middle of the day
2014-10-25 14:05:05	askore	nagiosbot was broken
2014-10-25 14:05:06	dom	even on a saturday
2014-10-25 14:05:10	askore	reporting repeatedly for the same boxes
2014-10-25 14:05:13	askore	so I killed it
2014-10-25 14:05:30	bajr	so why are the boxes down?
2014-10-25 14:05:41	Golem	bajr: exactly
2014-10-25 14:05:48	thyme	Yar
2014-10-25 14:05:52	dom	are they down or is it just nagios?
2014-10-25 14:05:52	bajr	*nix: is this a planned thing?
2014-10-25 14:06:00	dom	and is it just the cs labs or all the labs?
2014-10-25 14:06:08	Golem	It appears to be all the labs
2014-10-25 14:06:17	dom	5517? eb325?
2014-10-25 14:06:26	Golem	5517 definately
2014-10-25 14:06:30	Golem	not sure about 325
2014-10-25 14:06:32	Golem	one sec
2014-10-25 14:06:36	dom	the windows boxes and the nix boxes?
2014-10-25 14:06:39	bajr	Golem: call janaka and notify him with what you know
2014-10-25 14:07:48	bajr	who do we have on campus?
2014-10-25 14:07:56	askore	what?
2014-10-25 14:07:58	askore	o,o
2014-10-25 14:08:25	askore	did the power go out?
2014-10-25 14:08:48	Golem	nope
2014-10-25 14:08:55	Golem	might be nagiosbos running amok
2014-10-25 14:08:55	askore	are they back up?
2014-10-25 14:08:59	askore	.....
2014-10-25 14:09:07	Golem	we are getting limited ssh access, so we are checking
2014-10-25 14:09:18	dom	so they are coming back?
2014-10-25 14:09:23	Golem	seems like
2014-10-25 14:09:31	thyme	chinstrap is up
2014-10-25 14:09:40	Dagon	I'm on chinstrap, it never went down
2014-10-25 14:09:59	piratez	anyone on campus? check power outtage? windy as heck...
2014-10-25 14:10:10	Dagon	If you want I can try logging into others?
2014-10-25 14:10:10	dom	^ its super windy here at neuberger
2014-10-25 14:10:10	Golem	yellow-eyed appears to still be down
2014-10-25 14:10:16	dom	from what I can see out the winow
2014-10-25 14:10:19	thyme	muon is up, so is it just some?
2014-10-25 14:10:32	Golem	yeah, try and log on to partical lab and penguin lab boxes
2014-10-25 14:10:34	askore	do you have a list of some that definitely went down?
2014-10-25 14:10:37	bajr	I can't seem to ping the windows boxes
2014-10-25 14:10:41	Golem	askore: working on it
2014-10-25 14:10:45	bajr	*windows lab boxes
2014-10-25 14:10:56	piratez	luxon is fine
2014-10-25 14:11:12	dom	are you sure? I cant reach luxon
2014-10-25 14:11:20	bajr	Golem: did you call janaka?
2014-10-25 14:11:24	dom	nvm can now
2014-10-25 14:11:35	Golem	No, they started coming back on before I could
2014-10-25 14:11:40	Golem	325 appears clear
2014-10-25 14:11:47	bajr	let him know anyhow
2014-10-25 14:11:49	Golem	Ok
2014-10-25 14:11:55	Dagon	I just logged into erect-crested and that wasn't working before
2014-10-25 14:12:22	piratez	the nagios had a sad
2014-10-25 14:12:26	thyme	Are they configured to reboot if the power shuts off?
2014-10-25 14:12:40	dom	well, if they lose power, they'll turn off
2014-10-25 14:13:40	thyme	I can't think of the right name for it, but basically it turns back on when it gets power back
2014-10-25 14:14:12	benzer	why would the power affect only on the computers not in use?
2014-10-25 14:14:18	askore	so did any boxes actually get turned off, and which ones?
2014-10-25 14:14:44	Dagon	I don't really know much about what's happening. but the computers were on and we were trying to log in without success.
2014-10-25 14:14:45	thyme	oooh only not in use, yeah that sounds like something other then power,
2014-10-25 14:14:48	Dagon	I don't think the power went out
2014-10-25 14:14:50	piratez	dom had a good idea that maybe it was something between nagios and the boxes, not the boxes themselves
2014-10-25 14:15:00	piratez	or nagios is just sad today
2014-10-25 14:15:04	piratez	and wants attention
2014-10-25 14:15:15	dom	piratez: ^ but they couldn't log in
2014-10-25 14:15:21	piratez	they?
2014-10-25 14:15:32	dom	Dagon, Golem, other cats on campus
2014-10-25 14:15:35	piratez	oh
2014-10-25 14:17:08	dom	can't ssh to yellow-eyed
2014-10-25 14:17:13	dom	get no route to host
2014-10-25 14:17:17	dom	same with glueball
2014-10-25 14:17:31	thyme	can you inspect the lab in person?
2014-10-25 14:17:40	thyme	Golem^
2014-10-25 14:17:45	Dagon	Want me to find those and try? I'm in the lab.
2014-10-25 14:17:51	dom	Dagon: sure
2014-10-25 14:18:11	dom	im @ neuberger at work, those are just from my runaway script
2014-10-25 14:18:30	xoraxiom	the lab boxes are up and have been up, it would seem.
2014-10-25 14:18:56	Golem	one sec
2014-10-25 14:18:56	dom	fiordland says its been up only 24 minutes
2014-10-25 14:19:13	dom	macaroni says 0 minutes its been up
2014-10-25 14:19:40	Dagon	dom: yellow-eyed was powered off
2014-10-25 14:19:44	xoraxiom	I just spot checked a few that nagios alerted on, so...
2014-10-25 14:19:45	Golem	aha
2014-10-25 14:20:00	askore	let's not take nagios's word for anything
2014-10-25 14:20:01	dom	Yellow-eyed was probably just from a class or something
2014-10-25 14:20:03	askore	it was/is super broken
2014-10-25 14:20:08	dom	im not going on nagios's word
2014-10-25 14:20:10	askore	some config files are borked
2014-10-25 14:20:24	dom	my runaway script does uptime on all the boxes, thats what im reading
2014-10-25 14:20:46	xoraxiom	So it's entirely likely that it's a nagios blurp... grr.
2014-10-25 14:20:58	xoraxiom	dom++ nice
2014-10-25 14:21:19	Golem	Yeah, it didnt look like they shut down, they just denied access to them
2014-10-25 14:22:02	Golem	Jannaka informed, he thinks its was a network reset somewhere
2014-10-25 14:22:10	dom	yeah thats what im figuring
2014-10-25 14:22:21	DaBAH	I'm gonna ping CAtastrophe to check.
2014-10-25 14:23:41	thyme	bottom line, everything is up in the labs atm, right?
2014-10-25 14:23:48	dom	is glueball up?
2014-10-25 14:23:54	pfaffle	hmm
2014-10-25 14:23:58	dom	that was the other one that mighta got powerbuttoned
2014-10-25 14:24:02	Dagon	dom: I didn't see that. where is it?
2014-10-25 14:24:10	dom	im thinking particle lab
2014-10-25 14:24:10	Golem	glueball is still not accepting ssh
2014-10-25 14:24:15	Golem	might just be powered off
2014-10-25 14:24:17	dom	^
2014-10-25 14:24:48	DaBAH	CATastrophe paged.
2014-10-25 14:24:54	Dagon	Not sure where that lab is, but if you tell me where it is I can check.

2014-10-25 14:26:17	Golem	according to lab status we still have a lot down in tektroix, but I am not sure how accurate this is for that room
2014-10-25 14:26:36	thyme	they might just be in hybernation right?
2014-10-25 14:26:43	Golem	thyme: could be
2014-10-25 14:26:44	bajr	Golem: they're likely in hibernation

2014-10-25 14:31:39	DaBAH	pfaffle - that would explain it.
2014-10-25 14:32:17	DaBAH	I wonder if the UPS tried to self test and failed. :-)
2014-10-25 14:32:37	DaBAH	(this is how we usually discover that the batteries need replacement)
2014-10-25 14:33:07	Golem	DaBAH: that is a system that is staggering for many reasons
2014-10-25 14:33:09	davburns	...?
2014-10-25 14:33:25	Dagon	Ok glueball is working
2014-10-25 14:33:25	davburns	Not self-test.
2014-10-25 14:34:19	Golem	confirm glueball
2014-10-25 14:34:25	Golem	its up
2014-10-25 14:34:58	pfaffle	hm. looks like it did it more than once
2014-10-25 14:35:04	davburns	There's been real power outages.
2014-10-25 14:35:07	dom	yeah it was probably still down from a new beginnings class or something GOlem
2014-10-25 14:35:13	pfaffle	13:54 as well
2014-10-25 14:35:25	Golem	dom: I would wager you are correct
2014-10-25 14:35:45	DaBAH	davburns - we haz local UPS in fab80?
2014-10-25 14:36:30	davburns	Is someone on-site?  Are lights on/off and stuff?
2014-10-25 14:36:45	Golem	davburns: lights are on, labs are back up
2014-10-25 14:36:51	Golem	at least in the doghous
2014-10-25 14:37:01	pfaffle	whole bunch of links went up and down on eb312a and eb340a as well
2014-10-25 14:37:11	pfaffle	though the switches themselves didn't
2014-10-25 14:37:29	davburns	DaBAH: We have 3 local UPSes
2014-10-25 14:37:46	DaBAH	davburns: in chatting with Golem, they didn't seem to notice any power gliches and the systems in the labs didn't seem to spontaneously reboot.
2014-10-25 14:37:59	blkperl	just network failure of some sort

2014-11-05 10:18:21	ryan	when turning it off and back on, the machine outputted to one monitor while it went through the boot process, but before the login screen came up it went dark.
2014-11-05 10:19:13	ryan	then, caps lock and such were the only thing that would get a response, the left monitor seemed like it had no signal and the right just came out of power save mode then went back.

2014-11-06 14:52:29	Ant	is there a way I could copy this to karla's directory, or lewisric's homedir?
2014-11-06 14:52:53	Ant	folder structure is /cs162/lab6/supplied.o
2014-11-06 14:53:30	 *	pfaffle is a little sketched out by the idea of snatching someone's homedir files and moving them to someone else's
2014-11-06 14:53:44	bowzr	yea, who is requesting this?
2014-11-06 14:54:12	Ant	Karla's tutor lewisric
2014-11-06 14:54:48	Ant	the student in concern has deleted an object file and the tutor / karla need to copy supplied.o back into the homedir
2014-11-06 14:54:55	pfaffle	oh, i see
2014-11-06 14:55:00	pfaffle	that's different
2014-11-06 14:56:34	Ant	The object file that exists is in lewisric's homedir, and needs to be copied into jinghan's
2014-11-06 14:57:06	Ant	Is there a way that I could do this, or is it a different issue?

2014-11-06 14:57:33	pfaffle	is it world-readable in lewis's homedir?
2014-11-06 14:57:42	Ant	should be
2014-11-06 14:57:52	pfaffle	you can su to the student and then copy it over
2014-11-06 15:01:25	pfaffle	(btw it's lewisrjc)

2014-11-06 15:32:07	DaBAH	Do we want some of Don's lockers for Texas?  Could we use them for something useful?  Would we have space for it?
2014-11-06 15:34:43	Atticus	We could use a CRAM dedicated pc for users coming to the front desk without and ID
2014-11-06 15:35:58	ryan	It would also be helpful if it were a machine that non-CATs can log into, to allow for testing a user's login problems without leaving desk to try it in a general purpose lab.
2014-11-06 15:37:12	pfaffle	how did we go from lockers -> pc ?
2014-11-06 15:37:48	taron	good question

2014-11-06 15:44:47	DaBAH	You could put a cram dedicated pc in one of the lockers and then have the student guess the combination of the lock in order to change their password.
2014-11-06 15:45:10	DaBAH	Atticus: johnj is out sick today

2014-11-06 16:28:53	relsqui	DaBAH: also, it might help with the general bag and jacket clutter around the shared cubes and texas
2014-11-06 16:33:04	DaBAH	If interested, check with Don to see what the dimensions of the unit are and work with Texas/zoneBAH denizens to see if there is any wallspace available to actually host it.
2014-11-06 16:33:47	DaBAH	My recollection is that it is somewhat huge.
2014-11-06 16:34:35	relsqui	sure, will do
2014-11-06 16:37:00	DaBAH	So, I looked in 84 and I see two banks of 6-locker things sitting out there.  The unit isn't super huge.
2014-11-06 16:37:54	DaBAH	I'll check with him if that's what he's talking about.
2014-11-06 16:40:32	DaBAH	I've arked TheDon to confirm if that's what he's talking about.
2014-11-06 16:41:24	relsqui	DaBAH: yeah, nightfly++ and I just went and measured them
2014-11-06 16:41:58	relsqui	there are a couple of places in texas that they could go comfortably

2014-11-10 15:51:23	pfaffle	SIRAF: in this case, the issue is shared between at least two machines ( Flamestorm's and mine ) so if we were to do that, it'd have to be on the print server

2014-11-12 10:30:08	ryan	so apparently we have them both scheduled, is there any reason for that?
2014-11-12 10:31:02	 *	pfaffle dunno
2014-11-12 10:31:07	pfaffle	hiss ^ ?
2014-11-12 10:33:20	PokaDot	Besides the Induction night, i dont think so.
2014-11-12 10:34:10	PokaDot	benzer: ^^ ^^ ^°
2014-11-12 10:36:25	Fox	I'd have to guess we have them both reserved due to induction night, given that the ENT BD is in the CS Conf?
2014-11-12 10:38:40	benzer	PokaDot: ryan: we have 102 and 103 and 86-01, we just kinda overbooked. we don't use 103 for anything currently
2014-11-12 10:39:51	johnh	beth--
2014-11-12 10:40:30	ryan	benzer: so should I say they can have 103 back?
2014-11-12 10:40:38	ryan	...or do we do that?
2014-11-12 10:43:31	bajr	we should probably let go of 103
2014-11-12 10:45:01	ryan	johnh: so is that something I should try to help with, or is it better to leave it to somebody with more experience? I'm not quite sure what she means, either.
2014-11-12 10:46:10	ryan	bajr: this does still not sound like a concrete decision :P
2014-11-12 10:46:34	pfaffle	pretty sure she just wants someoen to run windows update on her laptop for her
2014-11-12 10:46:46	johnh	All I would expect to do is Windows Update, Adobe Updates (Reader, Flash, Shockwave) and Java Update
2014-11-12 10:47:40	johnh	and with WinUpdates, repeat until none. It's probably not been been since our last SnowDay
2014-11-12 10:47:46	pfaffle	heh
2014-11-12 10:52:01	 *	johnh wonders if anyone be pphelps has an Admin password %)
2014-11-12 11:02:50	langston	johnh: the computer is on the CAT desk and we dont know the maniger password
2014-11-12 11:03:05	pfaffle	oh did someone drop it off?

2014-11-12 11:03:26	pfaffle	ryan++
2014-11-12 11:03:31	ryan	but I didn't ask about a manager password.
2014-11-12 11:11:07	johnh	she doesn't know... but Warren does
2014-11-12 11:11:13	johnh	it's so obvious
2014-11-12 11:12:16	ryan	heh, nice.
2014-11-12 11:21:15	benzer	yes we can let go ofb103 if the need it
2014-11-12 11:21:57	benzer	ryan: ^
2014-11-12 11:30:02	langston	someting was droped off in to the incoming mail
