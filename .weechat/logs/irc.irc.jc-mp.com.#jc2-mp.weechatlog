2013-01-29 16:48:31	Eraknelo	Not to mention the specs.
2013-01-29 16:48:45	Cameron	i cant decide

2013-01-29 16:48:58	Cameron	either go all out with power

2013-01-29 16:50:29	Eraknelo	The latter already recommends the 15", however, I'm pretty damn sure you can get a better one for cheaper :\

2013-01-29 17:03:27	Eraknelo	Then there is no point in getting a high performance laptop, if you ask me.

2013-01-29 17:18:02	Eraknelo	Does a brilliant device not equal great specs?
2013-01-29 17:18:10	Eraknelo	And I can install Mac on a PC.
2013-01-29 17:18:21	@Woet	yes, you can by violating the apple guides

2013-01-29 17:20:25	@Woet	no need to update
2013-01-29 17:20:57	Eraknelo	Well, newer Windows run smoother. OSX is already pretty fucking smooth.
2013-01-29 17:21:32	Eraknelo	But if you're so convinced that you can deny an basic fact, then there's not really a point in arguing.

2013-01-29 17:23:54	Eraknelo	Oh, wait. It's Internet Explorer. But I better not say that, because it's probably Internet Explorer's fault, that this specific slideshow only lags on this site.
2013-01-29 17:24:13	@Woet	lol IE
2013-01-29 17:24:32	Eraknelo	lol Apple.

2013-01-29 17:25:47	Eraknelo	IE 9+ rocks, but I'm off. Cameron, think about those laptops. In my opinion, you really don't need a 15" 2800xwhateverthefuck resolution for THAT amount of money.

2013-01-31 13:00:34	[DRuG]Jeff	No but seriously some wireless adapters increase DPC latency. Just a little note people should know. Always use Wired over Wireless. Unless you've got a decent Wireless Adapter :3
2013-01-31 13:01:02	Sabreman	What does that hvae to do wiht game performance in singleplayer?

2013-01-31 13:03:30	ShadowDracos	That sounds specific to your system
2013-01-31 13:03:33	ShadowDracos	not to anyone else's
2013-01-31 13:03:40	ShadowDracos	you should probably have that looked at
2013-01-31 13:04:01	Sabreman	yea, never had that kind of problem
2013-01-31 13:04:11	Sabreman	you might have some sort of hardware fault in the wlan card.
2013-01-31 13:04:12	[DRuG]Jeff	I've had the laptop replaced, its due to certain brands of Wireless adapter
2013-01-31 13:04:18	Sabreman	or that
2013-01-31 13:04:29	Sabreman	just get a usb wifi adapter and disable the card
2013-01-31 13:05:21	[DRuG]Jeff	Wired it runs fine and max settings
2013-01-31 13:07:43	[DRuG]Jeff	All I'm saying is that certain brands of Wireless adapter does impact the performance of Single Player games strangely enough. There is nothing wrong with Steam

2013-01-31 19:44:16	dab88	not many games supported atm, maybe that's why it only recognises 5 http://www.geforce.co.uk/drivers/geforce-experience/supported-games

2013-01-31 19:50:18	%dreadmullet	it was 6 hours long, there were constantly 20-30 people
2013-01-31 19:50:34	%dreadmullet	too many changes to name

2013-01-31 21:13:31	EshayAdlay	I was told that people here would have the answer to bypassing the debug protection on JC2. Is this correct?

2013-01-31 21:18:29	[DRuG]Jeff	Does that answer my thought Philpax?
2013-01-31 21:18:37	@Philpax	not at all
2013-01-31 21:18:50	[DRuG]Jeff	Damn, what was I meant to be thinking about?
2013-01-31 21:18:53	[DRuG]Jeff	The IRC test?

2013-01-31 21:19:50	EshayAdlay	anyone here a dev for jc mp that would know how to bypass the protection?
2013-01-31 21:19:52	[DRuG]Jeff	Got annoyed because someone ballzed up a race and had only 6 players in it...Someone commented out the node spawns
2013-01-31 21:20:17	[DRuG]Jeff	I don't want to say their names because they'll bite me

2013-01-31 21:24:04	@Philpax	it looks nice, but it didn't take too long to realize it took up *far* too much space
2013-01-31 21:24:15	[DRuG]Jeff	Yeah way too much
2013-01-31 21:24:24	[DRuG]Jeff	It should just be a name and a bar below the name
2013-01-31 21:24:43	@Philpax	and that's what it's like now
2013-01-31 21:24:45	[DRuG]Jeff	 /debug command should toggle more info
2013-01-31 21:24:48	@Philpax	the new nametags were a compromise
2013-01-31 21:24:50	@Philpax	also, what /debug command?
2013-01-31 21:25:09	[DRuG]Jeff	I'm meaning make a /debug commmand. A bit like SAMP's /dl command
2013-01-31 21:25:12	@Philpax	I'm sorry, Trix wrote a lot of stuff for the test that I'm completely unaware of :P

2013-01-31 21:29:55	[DRuG]Jeff	Is this what you are or earlier were testing?
2013-01-31 21:30:10	@Philpax	that's a fairly old screenshot

2013-01-31 21:30:54	[DRuG]Jeff	Yeah Philpax I suggest a command like /dl on SAMP for JC2MP
2013-01-31 21:31:01	@Philpax	what does it do?
2013-01-31 21:31:22	[DRuG]Jeff	Gives you the details on the vehicle, more specific details

2013-02-01 01:34:22	F430	funny enough, only head-on collisions with walls etc cause physical damage
2013-02-01 01:34:35	F430	rolling and woeting the car doesnt do anything besides scratches and dents

2013-02-01 01:43:36	@Philpax	right now player tags disappear at 400m
2013-02-01 01:43:41	@Philpax	I can make them disappear at 500
2013-02-01 01:43:44	@Philpax	but it's not going to make a lot of difference
2013-02-01 01:43:51	Nixolas1	was it more before?

2013-02-01 19:30:27	%dreadmullet	maybe it was only IRC

2013-02-01 19:37:41	Namidairo	 The speedometer shows you your current, and max, speed in a vehicle.
2013-02-01 19:37:42	Namidairo	   How fast can you go? - I'm going to guess... 720.
2013-02-01 19:37:50	[DRuG]Jeff	750 is max I think

2013-02-01 19:42:45	Auran	do you reckon the 3-way glitch would work with a person or two in stunt-jump position?
2013-02-01 19:42:53	Auran	brad445:  can it run JC2?
2013-02-01 19:42:54	Namidairo	less so random pirates

2013-02-01 19:50:49	[DRuG]Jeff	Auran, that SysInfoLabs stuff isn't that accurate

2013-02-01 23:14:56	+Rick	OBS doesn't want to work for me, at least not the game capture
2013-02-01 23:15:02	+Rick	I can do window capture but the quality is shit
2013-02-01 23:15:06	s0beit	twitch works for jc2mp?

2013-02-01 23:15:22	@Trix	wtf
2013-02-01 23:15:23	Mogey	Uhh, tried messing with settings? Theres a new version out that can record fullscreen.
2013-02-01 23:15:29	Mogey	http://obsproject.com/ Download the alpha.
2013-02-01 23:15:31	+Rick	well i'm playing windowed
2013-02-01 23:15:35	+Rick	oh true
2013-02-01 23:15:38	+Rick	I didn't think to try the alpha build
2013-02-01 23:15:38	Ari	JC2 actually runs windows, IIRC
2013-02-01 23:15:42	Ari	not true native fullscreen
2013-02-01 23:15:44	+Rick	but the changelog didn't indicate game capture fixes
2013-02-01 23:15:45	Ari	windowed**
2013-02-01 23:15:46	Mogey	As for alternatives, theres always FF-Split and X-Split. X-Split is really bad.
2013-02-01 23:15:50	lucid	s0be me
2013-02-01 23:15:52	+Rick	xsplit costs money
2013-02-01 23:15:57	[DRuG]Jeff	That explains why it doesn't always fit correctly
2013-02-01 23:15:59	+Rick	ffsplit can't do game window capture on its own
2013-02-01 23:16:07	Namidairo	xsplit is buywares

2013-02-01 23:16:08	Mogey	Ari: Yeah, IIRC it runs in borderless windowed. It always messes up my resolution when I alt tab.
2013-02-01 23:16:15	Ari	mhm
2013-02-01 23:16:38	Mogey	I guess your best bet would be OBS.

2013-02-02 10:49:10	@Trix	but yeah
2013-02-02 10:49:18	@Trix	if you have fps issues, /tags will definitely improve that
2013-02-02 10:49:25	@Trix	alternatively, if you just want player tags, /vtags will disable vehicle tags
2013-02-02 10:49:26	F430	only faction issue i heard mentioned constantly is that some areas are impossible to capture

2013-02-02 15:20:20	@Philpax	he's probably sleeping, Skindred

2013-02-02 15:20:43	Skindred	aight
2013-02-02 15:20:45	%dreadmullet	he went to bed way into the morning
2013-02-02 15:20:54	%dreadmullet	salute his efforts
2013-02-02 15:21:03	Skindred	tell him to mail me if anything urgent comes up or needs testing, he has my addy
2013-02-02 15:21:23	Skindred	I was doing some tests for him with non-ascii chars in %AppData%

2013-02-02 15:23:19	@Philpax	yeah, because faction tags are drawn by the faction script
2013-02-02 15:23:25	@Philpax	and are also quite broken last time I checked
2013-02-02 15:23:31	@Philpax	so those need to be fixed
2013-02-02 15:23:35	Skindred	what if someone else is still in the last vehicle?
2013-02-02 15:23:43	Skindred	and you despawn it?
2013-02-02 15:23:48	@Philpax	yeah I was thinking about that, Skindred

2013-02-03 06:37:27	TonyTalent	now everytime i launch it it starts updating the same thing

2013-02-03 06:48:46	%dreadmullet	hmmmmmmmm
2013-02-03 06:48:56	%dreadmullet	maybe it doesn't call the vehicle exit event when you're jacked

2013-02-03 06:54:58	+Pail	dreadmullet is a foolish fool
2013-02-03 06:54:59	FabioGNR	how did you do it?
2013-02-03 06:55:06	%dreadmullet	I send the leaderboard to one player per tick, and the code got really complex
2013-02-03 06:55:06	FabioGNR	how do you sort them
2013-02-03 06:55:18	%dreadmullet	first by number of CPs hit, then by checkpoint distance
2013-02-03 06:55:19	FabioGNR	oh..
2013-02-03 06:55:22	FabioGNR	yeah
2013-02-03 06:55:24	FabioGNR	thats the good way
2013-02-03 06:55:26	FabioGNR	but
2013-02-03 06:55:32	FabioGNR	it goes wrong when sending it to clients?
2013-02-03 06:55:36	%dreadmullet	yeah
2013-02-03 06:55:39	%dreadmullet	I assume
2013-02-03 06:55:40	FabioGNR	btw
2013-02-03 06:55:47	FabioGNR	isnt a tick every milisecond
2013-02-03 06:55:49	Crazyman	dreadmullet: Try just sending position and total players
2013-02-03 06:55:56	Crazyman	And disable the leaderboard for a while
2013-02-03 06:56:19	%dreadmullet	the server sleeps the Lua thread for 10ms after every tick or something
2013-02-03 06:56:28	%dreadmullet	so, less than 100 ticks per sec
2013-02-03 06:56:44	FabioGNR	why so often?
2013-02-03 06:56:51	Crazyman	dreadmullet: Try sending every several ticks
2013-02-03 06:56:54	%dreadmullet	seems reasonable to me
2013-02-03 06:57:01	%dreadmullet	Crazyman: I'm redoing it completely
2013-02-03 06:57:17	Crazyman	Alright, have fun doing that :p
2013-02-03 06:57:20	FabioGNR	hmm, anyway; cant you do it clientside anyway? or are there not enough resources available there yet
2013-02-03 06:57:26	Crazyman	The whole race or just the position system?
2013-02-03 06:57:32	%dreadmullet	the position system for now
2013-02-03 06:57:50	%dreadmullet	the client sends checkpoint distance to the server every half-second or so
2013-02-03 06:58:13	Crazyman	Then there's no point in updating more often than that
2013-02-03 06:58:15	FabioGNR	hmm
2013-02-03 06:58:54	FabioGNR	I would do all the calculations clientside, using a timer; updating it every second or so
2013-02-03 06:59:22	Crazyman	FabioGNR: which calculations?
2013-02-03 06:59:42	Crazyman	There's really only sorting to do I think
2013-02-03 07:00:26	%dreadmullet	yeah I'm going to move a bunch of calcs to the client, but it will use slightly more bandwidth, no big deal
2013-02-03 07:00:34	%dreadmullet	it's probably trivial anyway
2013-02-03 07:00:45	FabioGNR	Crazyman, sorting yeah
2013-02-03 07:01:12	Crazyman	So send the data to the client and let it do the sorting
2013-02-03 07:01:16	Crazyman	That might work
2013-02-03 07:01:41	MrZunz	The amount of rocket spamming choppers is way too high

2013-02-03 07:02:10	MrZunz	I can't just magically put myself in a jet
2013-02-03 07:02:20	FabioGNR	im thinking
2013-02-03 07:02:24	%dreadmullet	can you /buy a jet?
2013-02-03 07:02:24	FabioGNR	will there be enough players

2013-02-03 07:27:54	Crazyman	I almost never use brakes on cavallo except for really sharp turns
2013-02-03 07:27:58	F430	not to mention zj suspension feels more stiffer, thus it bounces on everything

2013-02-03 08:36:13	%dreadmullet	h: but did you reconnect at other times with no trouble?
2013-02-03 08:36:14	mq522	well obviously, that's why I'm asking why not people play it. Letting people play is not a need, really
2013-02-03 08:36:30	+Gingie	...what?
2013-02-03 08:36:33	%dreadmullet	I suspect reconnecting clears a bunch of junk out
2013-02-03 08:36:35	@Woet	mq522: because we are testing to find crashes or bugs, not to entertain people
2013-02-03 08:36:38	h	that was the first race I'd been in since we talked. I took a break
2013-02-03 08:36:47	@Woet	mq522: once it has been released the focus will shift to making to entertaining
2013-02-03 08:36:52	%dreadmullet	okay
2013-02-03 08:36:55	@Woet	but stability is our concern right now.

2013-02-03 08:37:36	mq522	meh
2013-02-03 08:37:50	F430	mq522 why do you think major developers do closed tests, aside from internal QA?
2013-02-03 08:37:59	Crazyman	dreadmullet: Could you possible add a feature to pick between Titus ZJ and Machini Cavallo in the future?
2013-02-03 08:38:11	%dreadmullet	something something rewrite
2013-02-03 08:38:11	mq522	Different devs run different betas
2013-02-03 08:38:27	mq522	Do you have someone specific in mind?
2013-02-03 08:38:43	F430	but principle is still the same - let as many people test gameplay aspects to figure out possible issues
2013-02-03 08:38:44	TonyTalent	What's the stance of the devs on piracy? Are the against it as in "we will do everything we can against pirates" or just "we won't help them"?
2013-02-03 08:39:00	mq522	Yeah obviously
2013-02-03 08:39:12	+Gingie	The latter, TonyTalent
2013-02-03 08:39:13	+Gingie	afaik
2013-02-03 08:39:35	F430	if youre running pirated copy and play online, youre generally despised
2013-02-03 08:39:38	mq522	But the thing that I meant was that, if it doesn't take much effort to keep the server running, I don't see the reason to shut it down.
2013-02-03 08:39:40	+Gingie	Not going to explicitly prevent pirates from using the mod, but tools will be included so that individual owners can block pirates by their own choice
2013-02-03 08:39:57	TonyTalent	interesting
2013-02-03 08:39:58	@Woet	TonyTalent: once released it will have steam auth

2013-02-03 08:40:12	+Gingie	it changed then

2013-02-03 08:40:45	mq522	It's not in effect yet
2013-02-03 08:40:47	@Woet	TonyTalent: The keyword was "once released"
2013-02-03 08:40:50	TonyTalent	that you can't run pirated copies
2013-02-03 08:41:03	@Woet	TonyTalent: as in, not at this time, because it has not yet been released.
2013-02-03 08:41:12	TonyTalent	oh but you said can at the end
2013-02-03 08:41:28	TonyTalent	sorry bout that

2013-02-03 12:09:17	oscarandjo	JC-MP team, I'm quite impressed on how fast the big issues were fixed. I experienced crashes when grappling fire-engines to 474 jets and now they are fixed!
2013-02-03 12:09:22	oscarandjo	Thanks.
2013-02-03 12:10:12	Crazyman	Which reminds me, is the bug where trying to pull a car with a bus causes either of them to instantly start flying around fixed?
2013-02-03 12:10:56	Moo	I didn't try it in MP, but I never worked out how to grapple things to each other really in JC... Usually when I try the rope disappears when I'm turning around to look at the second thing
2013-02-03 12:11:41	Goblox	Is anyone else having connection issues?
2013-02-03 12:11:59	h	if you have to turn around while using the grapple it will mostly likely disappear
2013-02-03 12:12:08	Goblox	Keeps saying "Connection Failed. Press F2 to try again"
2013-02-03 12:12:09	h	you can sometimes be quick but it's not reliable
2013-02-03 12:12:17	+Mike	Moo: stand to the side so you don't have to turn 180
2013-02-03 12:12:18	h	most*
2013-02-03 12:12:22	Crazyman	Moo: if you turn too much the grapple disappears
2013-02-03 12:12:24	Moo	So what's the answer... Stand further away?
2013-02-03 12:12:30	Crazyman	Moo: Yes
2013-02-03 12:12:42	Crazyman	Stand back so you can see both without turning
2013-02-03 12:12:43	Moo	I'll have to try that
2013-02-03 12:12:48	Crazyman	Or with turning only a bit
2013-02-03 12:12:52	h	make the angle <130

2013-02-03 12:37:41	Mogey	Woet: Not really a relevant question but are the vehicles from the first test video of JC2 MP on the server somewhere? If so do you know their names? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hBheLY1jWc
2013-02-03 12:37:46	Goblox	no idea.. guess i just will be unable to connect
2013-02-03 12:38:01	@Woet	Mogey: they are DLC vehicles, not every player has them
2013-02-03 12:38:11	@Woet	so we cannot use them without causing issues for those who don't have them
2013-02-03 12:38:11	Mogey	Ah, thanks.
2013-02-03 12:38:15	sandthou	Did you guys downgrade it a version?
2013-02-03 12:38:23	@Woet	Goblox: no, it dies there for everyone who does a traceroute

2013-02-03 13:21:37	Mogey	dab88, that was my fear as well, that it wouldn't be as fun with less people. But as more server admins take advantage of scripting we'll probably see some awesome servers come out where many people play.

2013-02-03 13:22:15	Matt	Is there a list of features that have been confirmed by the devs to be added in the future?
2013-02-03 13:22:26	%dreadmullet	wiki --> features
2013-02-03 13:22:37	FabioGNR	LUAAAAAAA
2013-02-03 13:22:59	Mogey	Would a master-server and serverlist be available? Or will it be sort of like minecraft, enter an IP of a server you know?
2013-02-03 13:22:59	%dreadmullet	Lua is awesome, and our API is awesome
2013-02-03 13:23:00	%dreadmullet	just sayin
2013-02-03 13:23:13	%dreadmullet	something something server browser
2013-02-03 13:23:14	h	lua is great, but its fucking slow
2013-02-03 13:23:16	FabioGNR	yes
2013-02-03 13:23:26	%dreadmullet	what, you want C++?
2013-02-03 13:23:34	FabioGNR	Lua isnt that slow
2013-02-03 13:23:35	+Gingie	WTB more lua
2013-02-03 13:23:37	Matt	Oh cool ty dreadmullet
2013-02-03 13:23:39	+Gingie	never enough lua
2013-02-03 13:23:44	h	I'm just making the point
2013-02-03 13:23:54	FabioGNR	It depends what youre gonna do with it
2013-02-03 13:24:08	FabioGNR	but for use in a game server it's really good
2013-02-03 13:24:13	FabioGNR	( imo )
2013-02-03 13:24:27	Crazyman	dreadmullet: if it was on C++ I wonder how more glitched was your race module gonna be :P
2013-02-03 13:24:34	%dreadmullet	all the crashes
2013-02-03 13:24:36	%dreadmullet	all the bugs
2013-02-03 13:24:44	Mogey	Crazyman, he would probably spends years just debugging it.
2013-02-03 13:24:51	%dreadmullet	indeed
2013-02-03 13:24:52	FabioGNR	btw, modules are permanent?
2013-02-03 13:24:58	%dreadmullet	FabioGNR: what
2013-02-03 13:24:59	+Pail	Did you know that the diet of the Mediterranean trouser snake consists primarily of beaver?
2013-02-03 13:25:02	+Gingie	WTB more python
2013-02-03 13:25:02	FabioGNR	like
2013-02-03 13:25:03	+Gingie	:(
2013-02-03 13:25:05	@Philpax	if it was C++ then pretty sure server would've crashed about 37 times by now
2013-02-03 13:25:06	%dreadmullet	Pail: go away for a bit
2013-02-03 13:25:07	+Pail	Okay dreadmullet.  I'll be back later
2013-02-03 13:25:09	FabioGNR	will it use modules for ever?

2013-02-03 13:28:25	FabioGNR	I'm just concerned about the amount of players and the amount of servers
2013-02-03 13:28:29	FabioGNR	Panau is so fucking big
2013-02-03 13:28:38	FabioGNR	will it be fun with 100 players per server?
2013-02-03 13:28:39	Mogey	So was San andreas :P
2013-02-03 13:28:45	FabioGNR	no
2013-02-03 13:28:46	FabioGNR	SA is small
2013-02-03 13:28:49	FabioGNR	compared to Panau
2013-02-03 13:28:53	Mogey	I think that most servers will limit the map if scripts allow them to.
2013-02-03 13:29:02	FabioGNR	that would suck o.o
2013-02-03 13:29:03	dab88	FabioGNR if you know those 100 it will be loads of fun
2013-02-03 13:29:10	FabioGNR	well guess so
2013-02-03 13:29:27	h	that's a big if
2013-02-03 13:29:27	FabioGNR	I want to see CnR/RP servers :)))
2013-02-03 13:29:28	dab88	I've found below 400 on the tests it gets very empty and a bit dull
2013-02-03 13:29:34	Mogey	For RP servers, that wouldn't be that bad. I'm assuming the first types of servers to come up will be RP and Stunts/TDM.
2013-02-03 13:29:53	Mogey	Also if any dev can answer this question, will the devs be hosting their own server upon release?

2013-02-03 13:30:23	FabioGNR	faction system isnt fun with 100 players

2013-02-03 20:38:40	MMavipc	lua doesn't natively support regex from what I can see, I can code in the c function on my end, but then you won't be able to run it

2013-02-04 00:49:46	@Philpax	that could be faction bases or faction players, but I believe it's the latter
2013-02-04 00:50:07	@Philpax	which means it's probably an issue with not checking if the player is valid before drawing their faction tags

2013-02-04 00:52:22	@Philpax	yep
2013-02-04 00:52:31	[DRuG]Jeff	I believe /woet is still enabled in /race
2013-02-04 00:52:37	%dreadmullet	just remove /woet

2013-02-04 00:52:51	[DRuG]Jeff	Just limit it to freeroam world
2013-02-04 00:52:52	%dreadmullet	replace it with an actual /woet command that flips your car

2013-02-04 00:54:07	[DRuG]Jeff	So Hardscope for weapons
2013-02-04 00:54:09	%dreadmullet	only stuff like crouch/jump/shoot weapon
2013-02-04 00:54:12	%dreadmullet	etc

2013-02-04 00:54:44	MMavipc	connect and disconnect

2013-02-04 00:55:11	MMavipc	but there's no way to get it from lua
2013-02-04 00:55:29	MMavipc	philpax: we need a keypressed event
2013-02-04 00:55:30	[DRuG]Jeff	Yeah, except Factions was buggy. It said example: PTS was already ally to pts. Yet they said Neutral on their tag. So that means damage enabled
2013-02-04 00:55:42	%dreadmullet	blame Philpax
2013-02-04 00:55:43	@Philpax	MMavipc: could be used for a keylogger so I'm not going to add it for now
2013-02-04 00:55:55	@Philpax	[DRuG]Jeff: yes, it was completely broken until late Sunday
2013-02-04 00:56:02	%dreadmullet	what if someone's password is wasd

2013-02-04 00:56:57	MMavipc	philpax: it doesn't get handled while the game doesn't have focus, what of value could it possibly keylog
2013-02-04 00:57:12	@Philpax	in-game passwords
2013-02-04 00:57:26	MMavipc	scripts are sent server->client
2013-02-04 00:57:27	@Philpax	until I can make sure it won't be abused I'm not adding it
2013-02-04 00:57:32	%dreadmullet	/admin wasd
2013-02-04 00:57:33	@Philpax	and the client can send data to the server

2013-02-04 00:57:41	[DRuG]Jeff	dreadmullet, the image you linked. Was the server updated with that, or was that Clientside for yourself?
2013-02-04 00:57:44	@Philpax	another client script can intercept keypresses
2013-02-04 00:57:49	%dreadmullet	[DRuG]Jeff: race position?

2013-02-04 01:08:45	[DRuG]Jeff	The second one is hard to determine but thanks to the transparency of the GUI floating text you can just see the duplicate
2013-02-04 01:09:01	@Philpax	ah
2013-02-04 01:09:04	@Philpax	I can see bottom left
2013-02-04 01:09:06	@Philpax	bugger
2013-02-04 01:09:17	@Philpax	looks...like the clientside faction script was running twice?
2013-02-04 01:09:18	@Philpax	the fuck?
2013-02-04 01:09:35	@Philpax	no, wait, it's possible that there were two bases
2013-02-04 01:09:35	@Philpax	but how
2013-02-04 01:09:36	@Philpax	hmm
2013-02-04 01:09:50	[DRuG]Jeff	That would most likely explain it though Philpax
2013-02-04 01:09:51	+Pail	That would most likely sexplain it though Philpax
2013-02-04 01:09:51	crescentfresh	http://i.imgur.com/WzZjM5x.jpg  Thanks for racing Philpax!
2013-02-04 01:09:55	crescentfresh	and for an amazing test!
2013-02-04 01:10:05	@Philpax	thanks crescentfresh :)
2013-02-04 01:10:11	[DRuG]Jeff	The script forgot to destroy all the bases or crashed instantly preventing any cleanup
2013-02-04 01:10:12	+Tycoonman500	I was in the slowest car out of them
2013-02-04 01:10:13	+Tycoonman500	came third
2013-02-04 01:10:27	crescentfresh	I was dead last man :( on my own track so embarrassing
2013-02-04 01:10:39	@Philpax	I was first, then second, then back to first
2013-02-04 01:10:40	+Tycoonman500	I also did not fall off a cliff
2013-02-04 01:10:42	crescentfresh	Next time i will be first
2013-02-04 01:10:43	+Tycoonman500	new record for me
2013-02-04 01:10:46	@Philpax	pretty sure I would've kept first the entire time if I didn't answer questions :P
2013-02-04 01:10:48	MMavipc	I called Tycoonman500 very obscene things while testing out the filter
2013-02-04 01:10:55	+Tycoonman500	indeed you did
2013-02-04 01:10:56	[DRuG]Jeff	crescentfresh, Philpax knocked me off at the start
2013-02-04 01:10:58	crescentfresh	Wonderful tycoon, I am impressed xD second turn was really tight
2013-02-04 01:11:13	+Tycoonman500	Why do you think I had the slower car :P
2013-02-04 01:11:13	crescentfresh	You answered question's while driving? pft
2013-02-04 01:11:15	%dreadmullet	was the course up that hill?
2013-02-04 01:11:19	@Philpax	yeah dreadmullet
2013-02-04 01:11:20	@Philpax	up to the casino
2013-02-04 01:11:26	%dreadmullet	so, part of Cliffracer
2013-02-04 01:11:27	@Philpax	you should add it as an official race with 5-10 people
2013-02-04 01:11:27	@Philpax	good fun
2013-02-04 01:11:29	%dreadmullet	nice course
2013-02-04 01:11:30	[DRuG]Jeff	That 2nd corner up the hill he pushed me completely off
2013-02-04 01:11:38	crescentfresh	Is what jeff says true Philpax??
2013-02-04 01:11:41	@Philpax	crescentfresh: it's what I do
2013-02-04 01:11:42	crescentfresh	Dirty playing
2013-02-04 01:11:51	@Philpax	oh
2013-02-04 01:11:59	@Philpax	I accidentally knocked Jeff off
2013-02-04 01:12:02	crescentfresh	The course is called Blind Luck, dreadmullet ;P
2013-02-04 01:12:05	@Philpax	I came in from the left through the trees
2013-02-04 01:12:09	@Philpax	and managed to slide my way into first
2013-02-04 01:12:10	MMavipc	You should add 1 on 1 tourney racing
2013-02-04 01:12:11	crescentfresh	HAHA
2013-02-04 01:12:12	@Philpax	must've hit him on the way, though
2013-02-04 01:12:20	MMavipc	1 lap per round
2013-02-04 01:12:30	crescentfresh	Let's do it again next test, I will practice up
2013-02-04 01:12:34	[DRuG]Jeff	Lol I was racing in the Bus Desert track and someone infront tried to push me off before the bridge. I slammed on the brakes and cameup onside. He fell off and everyone that passed him was cracking up laughing
2013-02-04 01:12:40	crescentfresh	Only civaider though
2013-02-04 01:13:01	@Philpax	garrett traver-z best car 2013
2013-02-04 01:13:04	@Philpax	I use it for every race now
2013-02-04 01:13:06	@Philpax	it's just too good
2013-02-04 01:13:24	[DRuG]Jeff	I really hope the possibility of Ghost Mode will come :D Unlike SA-MP with zero ghost mode
2013-02-04 01:13:29	crescentfresh	I need to try that out, it's not as fast as the Civaider, but probably a lot heavier so it won't fly off with small jumps
2013-02-04 01:13:30	+Tycoonman500	Hedge Wildchild did not fall off a cliff
2013-02-04 01:13:38	crescentfresh	Wildchild is awesome around turns
2013-02-04 01:13:41	@Philpax	crescentfresh: handling is a lot tighter
2013-02-04 01:13:45	+Tycoonman500	Civadier is made of glass
2013-02-04 01:13:52	@Philpax	it doesn't oversteer like the cavallo and the civadier
2013-02-04 01:13:53	crescentfresh	Are you sure Philpax?
2013-02-04 01:13:58	@Philpax	(which, by the way, JaTochNietDan, is a terrible car)
2013-02-04 01:13:58	crescentfresh	Ill have to double check
2013-02-04 01:14:01	%dreadmullet	the Traver-Z fully upgraded is the fastest car
2013-02-04 01:14:10	%dreadmullet	but it handles like a wet sausage
2013-02-04 01:14:10	crescentfresh	oversteering is what makes it fun xD
2013-02-04 01:14:17	crescentfresh	LMFAO
2013-02-04 01:14:20	[DRuG]Jeff	Btw some sort of protection against spawning planes in MHC area. 3D restriction of course
2013-02-04 01:14:26	%dreadmullet	speaking of wet sausages, I'm getting hungry
2013-02-04 01:14:27	CriticalHit_NL	I remember you could teleport to people in your faction while not evening finishing their nick... later it didn't work anymore
2013-02-04 01:14:40	crescentfresh	wet sausages sure don't make me hungry
2013-02-04 01:14:42	crescentfresh	weirdo
2013-02-04 01:15:12	crescentfresh	finishing their nick?
2013-02-04 01:15:19	%dreadmullet	/f goto dre
2013-02-04 01:15:23	%dreadmullet	stuff like that
2013-02-04 01:15:27	CriticalHit_NL	like you don't need to type out their nick completely
2013-02-04 01:15:37	CriticalHit_NL	yup
2013-02-04 01:15:51	@Philpax	CriticalHit_NL: yeah, I changed that
2013-02-04 01:15:55	@Philpax	I'll fix it
2013-02-04 01:15:56	crescentfresh	You mean "bringall"
2013-02-04 01:16:19	crescentfresh	<3 that command
2013-02-04 01:16:34	crescentfresh	OH OH
2013-02-04 01:16:37	crescentfresh	Philpax i have a question
2013-02-04 01:16:39	[DRuG]Jeff	bringall should check if someone is in an instanced world
2013-02-04 01:17:00	@Philpax	yeah [DRuG]Jeff
2013-02-04 01:17:01	@Philpax	easy fix
2013-02-04 01:17:15	CriticalHit_NL	mkay Philpax
2013-02-04 01:17:19	crescentfresh	When I am typing out a message while in a vehicle, and the message ends with an "e" why does it kick me out?
2013-02-04 01:17:25	[DRuG]Jeff	Another thing is give us the OPTION to toggle full tags during races but leave them off by default
2013-02-04 01:17:28	crescentfresh	is that something that can be fixed?
2013-02-04 01:17:36	<--	AnticitizenZero (Mibbit@jc2-mp-5A893481.bb.ispone.net.au) has quit (Client quit)
2013-02-04 01:17:38	@Philpax	[DRuG]Jeff: understood, i'll change how the derby/racing nametags disable works
2013-02-04 01:17:57	@Philpax	crescentfresh: the input disabling that we do for the chat seems to end a little early, I'll see if there's anything that can be done
2013-02-04 01:18:14	crescentfresh	Thanks, it's sad to randomly fall out of my jet :(
2013-02-04 01:18:50	[DRuG]Jeff	Another thing is being able to close the /buy and /model easy. Not escape

2013-02-04 01:19:03	%dreadmullet	right click
2013-02-04 01:19:09	[DRuG]Jeff	^
2013-02-04 01:19:10	@Philpax	right click's used for changing categories
2013-02-04 01:19:18	crescentfresh	By the way, the base take overs worked amazingly. According to Tycoonman500 it was all your doing for making bases captureable
2013-02-04 01:19:26	[DRuG]Jeff	I thought you just scroll through to change categories
2013-02-04 01:19:32	[DRuG]Jeff	I always do that
2013-02-04 01:19:37	@Philpax	right, I'll just make rightclick close the window then
2013-02-04 01:19:41	[DRuG]Jeff	<3
2013-02-04 01:19:42	@Philpax	doesn't seem like many people used rightclick to switch categories anyway
2013-02-04 01:19:44	crescentfresh	It changes the dynamic of the game so much and makes the landscape populated with players
2013-02-04 01:19:47	djdasubz	Yeah Base Captures were good
2013-02-04 01:19:48	@Philpax	aye crescentfresh
2013-02-04 01:19:51	@Philpax	that's why I added it
2013-02-04 01:19:56	@Philpax	it was one of the things I wanted to see the most
2013-02-04 01:20:02	@Philpax	so I spent a week or so coding it
2013-02-04 01:20:05	@Philpax	and then it broke horribly
2013-02-04 01:20:07	@Philpax	then I spent two days fixing it
2013-02-04 01:20:08	%dreadmullet	how well did it work?
2013-02-04 01:20:08	@Philpax	:P
2013-02-04 01:20:11	crescentfresh	I didn't even know it was possible, but it just fit in amazingly
2013-02-04 01:20:14	crescentfresh	LOL
2013-02-04 01:20:17	[DRuG]Jeff	Bit buggy with taking over bases though
2013-02-04 01:20:19	crescentfresh	Must have been frusterating
2013-02-04 01:20:28	@Philpax	a bit is an understatement, [DRuG]Jeff
2013-02-04 01:20:30	crescentfresh	yeah jeff
2013-02-04 01:20:32	 *	Philpax quietly sobs to self
2013-02-04 01:20:36	+Tycoonman500	it broke less horribly with the new version of factions
2013-02-04 01:20:40	[DRuG]Jeff	4chan faction had the whole skull island I was trying to take
2013-02-04 01:20:48	crescentfresh	It didn't seem very buggy though, at least compared to other newly introduced features
2013-02-04 01:21:05	%dreadmullet	as I said in the beta channel long ago, this is turning into EVE Online
2013-02-04 01:21:11	@Philpax	...which I also proabbly coded
2013-02-04 01:21:14	@Philpax	probably*
2013-02-04 01:21:19	[DRuG]Jeff	USA faction murdered me after I said i come in peace and was moving away from the base. Tycoonman500 teleported to my dead body and murdered them after that
2013-02-04 01:21:20	@Philpax	I was responsible for quite a few new features
2013-02-04 01:21:28	crescentfresh	LOL
2013-02-04 01:21:29	@Philpax	[DRuG]Jeff: thanks for reminding me, I have to fix that
2013-02-04 01:21:30	%dreadmullet	Philpax: consider storing faction stuff on disk
2013-02-04 01:21:32	crescentfresh	beautiful
2013-02-04 01:21:38	@Philpax	aye dreadmullet, need to do the same with bank
2013-02-04 01:21:47	%dreadmullet	and I want racing stats :D
2013-02-04 01:21:51	crescentfresh	BTW bank idea is a stroke of genious
2013-02-04 01:21:58	[DRuG]Jeff	Philpax, give us some sort of way to reset our bank pass k :D
2013-02-04 01:22:01	crescentfresh	I was afraid that I had lost all my money for good
2013-02-04 01:22:02	@Philpax	crescentfresh: I got sick of crashing and losing my money :P
2013-02-04 01:22:03	+Tycoonman500	thank Philpax for bank
2013-02-04 01:22:10	crescentfresh	Thanks Philpax!
2013-02-04 01:22:11	+Tycoonman500	Philpax: it was worse for me :(
2013-02-04 01:22:16	@Philpax	I'm sorry Tycoonman500
2013-02-04 01:22:18	@Philpax	too late for you :(
2013-02-04 01:22:23	+Tycoonman500	indeed :(
2013-02-04 01:22:28	@Philpax	[DRuG]Jeff: it's planned
2013-02-04 01:22:29	MMavipc	philpax: you need to add the io library to your lua vm
2013-02-04 01:22:33	[DRuG]Jeff	Thank you Philpax for the Bank, but it was utterly useless after I forgot the pass XD
2013-02-04 01:22:36	@Philpax	fuck off MMavipc
2013-02-04 01:22:41	@Philpax	I took it out because of how badly it would be exploited
2013-02-04 01:22:43	MMavipc	nou
2013-02-04 01:22:44	crescentfresh	LOL
2013-02-04 01:22:47	@Philpax	for serverside, yeah, it's there
2013-02-04 01:22:48	@Philpax	for clientside
2013-02-04 01:22:49	@Philpax	nope
2013-02-04 01:22:50	@Philpax	never happening
2013-02-04 01:22:54	[DRuG]Jeff	+1
2013-02-04 01:22:55	djdasubz	LMFAO!
2013-02-04 01:23:09	MMavipc	you know how GMOD still has it, but sandboxed?
2013-02-04 01:23:10	%dreadmullet	bring back os.exit() for the client
2013-02-04 01:23:13	[DRuG]Jeff	You really just open the floodgates for exploits having that there
2013-02-04 01:23:17	@Philpax	yes MMavipc
2013-02-04 01:23:21	@Philpax	but GMod is also completely different
2013-02-04 01:23:21	MMavipc	why not that?
2013-02-04 01:23:31	@Philpax	GMod is a game that you can run by yourself
2013-02-04 01:23:34	@Philpax	you don't need a server for it
2013-02-04 01:23:44	[DRuG]Jeff	As it creates a Local server
2013-02-04 01:23:45	@Philpax	there is no reason to store data on the client for JC2-MP
2013-02-04 01:24:03	[DRuG]Jeff	Local servers for JC2-MP would be great :D
2013-02-04 01:24:03	MMavipc	persistent settings
2013-02-04 01:24:05	MMavipc	like localchat
2013-02-04 01:24:12	%dreadmullet	could be sent to the server
2013-02-04 01:24:18	[DRuG]Jeff	factionchat, localchat and globalchat
2013-02-04 01:24:19	@Philpax	localchat was a clientside Lua script
2013-02-04 01:24:20	%dreadmullet	and stored on the server etc
2013-02-04 01:24:23	@Philpax	it's not necessarily running on every server
2013-02-04 01:24:30	MMavipc	but on servers it is
2013-02-04 01:24:34	[DRuG]Jeff	racechat
2013-02-04 01:24:35	MMavipc	it would be activated automatically
2013-02-04 01:24:38	[DRuG]Jeff	derbychat
2013-02-04 01:24:44	[DRuG]Jeff	chatchat
2013-02-04 01:24:45	[DRuG]Jeff	:D
2013-02-04 01:24:50	crescentfresh	LOL
2013-02-04 01:24:57	@Philpax	[DRuG]Jeff: racechat and derbychat are local chat, foo :P
2013-02-04 01:25:23	[DRuG]Jeff	I was just mumbling lol

2013-02-04 05:18:19	Auran	for the game specific code to get player positions etc
2013-02-04 05:18:33	Auran	but I'm not a developer of jc2-mp
2013-02-04 05:19:18	Ahrotahntee	Good morning folks
2013-02-04 05:19:46	Quu	fakkof men :D
2013-02-04 05:19:48	Mast3rPlan	Auran: I was thinking that too :p I'd love to help develop on the mod itself though... I love it! :)

2013-02-04 05:24:35	@Trix	The server will be released with the client

2013-02-04 13:42:01	FabioGNR	idc
2013-02-04 13:42:07	FabioGNR	as long as they release it to pc..
2013-02-04 13:42:13	+Rick	don't care
2013-02-04 13:42:15	+Rick	gta5 will be a bad game
2013-02-04 13:42:53	TheBionicDude	Even if they release it on PC, I wont buy it. Wonder why? Try to optimize GTA IV on PC. It will answer all of your questions.
2013-02-04 13:43:50	Eye	opinion, since GTA-SA the whole franchise is shit
2013-02-04 13:44:00	FabioGNR	rick what o.o
2013-02-04 13:44:09	FabioGNR	TheBionicDude I know
2013-02-04 13:44:14	FabioGNR	but its still such a good game

2013-02-04 13:44:38	TheBionicDude	Hey, want to play it on the highest graphics?! NOPE.
2013-02-04 13:44:56	+Rick	FabioGNR: because GTA has gone in the wrong direction
2013-02-04 13:44:59	+Rick	GTA4 was bad
2013-02-04 13:45:08	+Rick	GTA5 will be bad (because it looks like they're still going in that direction)
2013-02-04 13:45:20	FabioGNR	define that direction
2013-02-04 13:45:40	Eye	mainstream....
2013-02-04 13:45:44	TheBionicDude	I want a more laid back GTA. Something in the lines of GTA VCS/SA. Those two games were awesome.  It looks like they are becoming a bit too serious and I hope they make it up with GTA V.
2013-02-04 13:45:47	+Rick	no
2013-02-04 13:46:00	+Rick	dumb drama and emphasis on dumb shit
2013-02-04 13:46:13	TheBionicDude	I mean, GTA IV wasn't a bad game by any means, but the drama was over acted and it just didnt feel that way.
2013-02-04 13:46:29	+Rick	it was a bad game
2013-02-04 13:46:30	FabioGNR	There are things I didnt like about gta4

2013-02-04 13:49:58	TheBionicDude	Saints Row 2 actually had some "feel" moments in it.
2013-02-04 13:50:00	+Rick	is that it takes itself too seriously

2013-02-04 13:50:07	FabioGNR	I guess

2013-02-06 06:07:33	Mast3rPlan	i know, but most likely not shuffled
2013-02-06 06:07:50	Mast3rPlan	anyway, i could still generate sub signatures and bind it to that
2013-02-06 06:07:53	Mast3rPlan	would still work
2013-02-06 06:08:04	Mast3rPlan	you'd have to change all rpc methods
2013-02-06 06:08:12	@Trix	yes, you could use flair signatures in IDA
2013-02-06 06:08:53	Mast3rPlan	flair signatures huh? let me look up what this magic is

2013-02-06 06:18:29	Mast3rPlan	you think it might be because this is a different version of raknet than you are using or did you deliberately shift arguments around?
2013-02-06 06:18:50	@Trix	no, you're doing it wrong
2013-02-06 06:19:08	Mast3rPlan	but whaaaa, what am i doin wrong? D:
2013-02-06 06:19:18	Mast3rPlan	chat has a boolean in it's arguments?
2013-02-06 06:20:21	Mast3rPlan	cus strings get read aligned, and afaik the bits that are in the serializedargument bitstream are shifted one bit to the right...

2013-02-06 07:41:36	F430	did they make you a developer yet
2013-02-06 07:41:55	Mast3rPlan	what no
2013-02-06 07:41:59	Mast3rPlan	why would they? :p
2013-02-06 07:42:05	F430	too bad
2013-02-06 07:42:08	F430	because you want to help?
2013-02-06 07:42:13	F430	its pretty obvious
2013-02-06 07:42:57	Mast3rPlan	i do.. but
2013-02-06 07:43:09	Mast3rPlan	i mean,they probably finished ALOT already...
2013-02-06 07:43:13	F430	then wait for your turn
2013-02-06 07:43:16	Mast3rPlan	so they don't need me
2013-02-06 07:43:22	F430	they get about 60 letters and email a day
2013-02-06 07:43:32	FlamingJuice	i smell sarcasm
2013-02-06 07:43:51	F430	no sarcasm
2013-02-06 07:44:05	FlamingJuice	irony*
2013-02-06 07:44:06	F430	they have to decline many help offers but theyre refusing to be blunt about it
2013-02-06 07:44:41	F430	they tell you they dont need you, then they realize they actually do need someone with that skill set. who looks stupid then?
2013-02-06 07:44:45	F430	devs, obviously
2013-02-06 07:45:08	F430	thats why theyre always being evasive about saying whether they need anything or not
2013-02-06 07:45:56	randomg	do they actually allow guest devs for short periods of time?
2013-02-06 07:46:34	F430	i assume they guests guests to show quick coding demos so theyre aware of how knowledgable and skilled they are
2013-02-06 07:46:43	F430	they get *
2013-02-06 07:47:39	F430	because any self-respecting developer should be able to do that on the spot, but it should also be within their portfolio

2013-02-06 13:50:22	Irkalla	What's with the fully working AA guns at Fortress?

2013-02-06 13:50:55	%dreadmullet	do you mean they shoot at you in MP?
2013-02-06 13:51:10	Irkalla	Yep.  Is that some clientside junk or is it actually functional?
2013-02-06 13:51:16	%dreadmullet	yeah it's clientside
2013-02-06 13:51:16	Ahrotahntee	I thought stationary turrets weren't sync'd

2013-02-06 13:53:07	Irkalla	What's the outlook on working SAM sites with sync'd alive/dead states?
2013-02-06 13:53:13	FlamingJuice	they really have to allow embed videos on this forum
2013-02-06 13:53:15	Irkalla	that would be baller as hell, you know.

2013-02-06 13:53:27	%dreadmullet	the missiles wouldn't be synced, though
2013-02-06 13:53:32	Irkalla	right

2013-02-06 13:53:52	Irkalla	I was actually thinking that perhaps they could not shoot at anything unless they were in faction territory
2013-02-06 13:53:53	Ahrotahntee	every particle should be sync'd
2013-02-06 13:53:58	Irkalla	then engage based upon faction relations
2013-02-06 13:54:01	Ahrotahntee	not a single bit of dust left out!

2013-02-06 13:54:34	Ahrotahntee	if I do a low pass over Woet with an F14 and it kicks up a dust cloud that looks like Trix, I want Woet to see that dust cloud!
2013-02-06 13:54:36	Irkalla	My only complaint, from a balance perspective, is that territory is too easy to cap.
