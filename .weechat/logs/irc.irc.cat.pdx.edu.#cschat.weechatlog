2013-04-25 22:20:49	greghaynes	somethig like how its considered a stale mate in tournament play, then it was proven mateable but no one could possible pull it off so its still a stale mate

2013-04-26 00:22:44	Epitrope	is there a way in perl to do something like `$foo = \&mysub($arg1); &$foo($arg2)` to get mysub($arg1, $arg2)?

2013-04-26 00:27:10	nibalizer	then write the thing you're trying to make in not perl

2013-04-26 00:27:31	nibalizer	oh shit
2013-04-26 00:27:34	nibalizer	i dbl negatived
2013-04-26 00:27:34	nightfly	lol
2013-04-26 00:27:36	nibalizer	sorry
2013-04-26 00:27:41	Epitrope	nibalizer: heh
2013-04-26 00:27:50	nibalizer	no but really
2013-04-26 00:28:20	Wren	karmabot: nibalizer is writhes all his code
2013-04-26 00:28:20	karmabot	Sure, Wren.
2013-04-26 00:28:33	nibalizer	i think you lots me at \&mysub($arg1)
2013-04-26 00:28:52	Epitrope	what I want is a reference to a sub with one argument already specified
2013-04-26 00:28:52	nibalizer	becuase i dont see how those sigls work on a function, erm subroutine
2013-04-26 00:29:01	nightfly	what are you trying to do?
2013-04-26 00:29:07	Epitrope	so that I can pass that into something else which knows what the second argument is
2013-04-26 00:29:14	nibalizer	hahahhahaahhaha
2013-04-26 00:29:15	nibalizer	yea no
2013-04-26 00:29:22	nibalizer	maybe in some other language
2013-04-26 00:29:30	nibalizer	but i'd be shocked if perl supports that
2013-04-26 00:29:50	nibalizer	and even if you got it to work, i'll still hate it cus it would be piss for readability
2013-04-26 00:29:57	Epitrope	I kinda expect it to support it, but what would be shocking is if it's readable
2013-04-26 00:30:00	Epitrope	yeah, that
2013-04-26 00:30:17	nightfly	Epitrope: google the ebook "higher order perl"
2013-04-26 00:30:25	nibalizer	yea, refrence to functions, sure
2013-04-26 00:30:33	nightfly	I'm sure partial application is discussed
2013-04-26 00:30:41	Epitrope	nibalizer: it does have references to functions; I have that part working
2013-04-26 00:30:42	nibalizer	but why would you need a refences to a function if you're not in a jump table?
2013-04-26 00:30:48	Epitrope	and I think it's actually not entirely unreadable
2013-04-26 00:31:01	Epitrope	nibalizer: to do map?
2013-04-26 00:31:17	Epitrope	nightfly++ thank you; /me googles
2013-04-26 00:31:53	nibalizer	Epitrope: i guess im used to python where functions are objects so I can just pass them to map
2013-04-26 00:32:11	nibalizer	or maybe python has cooler things down there that make that just work
2013-04-26 00:32:17	nibalizer	so wait
2013-04-26 00:32:21	nibalizer	now that im thinking about this
2013-04-26 00:32:25	nibalizer	in python i can say
2013-04-26 00:32:40	nibalizer	def foo(a, b, c='argument'):
2013-04-26 00:32:57	nibalizer	and then one need only pass a,b into the function, but they can add a c if they chose
2013-04-26 00:33:05	nibalizer	is that all you're trying to get working?
2013-04-26 00:33:10	nibalizer	wait
2013-04-26 00:33:12	Epitrope	nibalizer: that's a default parameter
2013-04-26 00:33:16	Epitrope	that's not what I'm looking for
2013-04-26 00:33:35	nibalizer	so what are you looking for?
2013-04-26 00:33:45	nightfly	an anonymous function
2013-04-26 00:33:56	-->	MrBlue (~MrBlue@host-216-40.resnet.pdx.edu) has joined #cschat
2013-04-26 00:34:17	nightfly	that does prefeeds one argument to the function that takes two and takes the remaining argument
2013-04-26 00:34:35	Epitrope	yeah, that would work
2013-04-26 00:35:00	Epitrope	although perl functions are janky as fuck
2013-04-26 00:35:16	Epitrope	"you want named arguments? you can just pull them out of @_"
2013-04-26 00:36:01	Epitrope	which reminds me of the last panel of http://browsertoolkit.com/fault-tolerance.png
2013-04-26 00:37:30	nibalizer	nightfly: i can never tell your desire to use anonymous functions from a real need to use anonymous functions
2013-04-26 00:37:48	nibalizer	i mean this sounds like a job for a decorator
2013-04-26 00:37:55	nibalizer	maybe thats an anonymous function thing idunno
2013-04-26 00:38:06	Epitrope	what would you decorate? and with what?
2013-04-26 00:39:11	nibalizer	the function you have could be decorated to have a new default paramater
2013-04-26 00:39:13	pilgrimd	With pearls, of course.
2013-04-26 00:39:14	nibalizer	if i understand
2013-04-26 00:39:22	nibalizer	I sitll don't really know what you want
2013-04-26 00:39:34	pilgrimd	nibalizer: That is a normal reaction when confronted with perl.
2013-04-26 00:40:07	Epitrope	pilgrimd: well, to be fair, I've been pretty coy
2013-04-26 00:40:30	nightfly	nibalizer: anonymous functions are a very easy way to do partial application, everything I've used either just does it directly or wraps it in a macro that does it.
2013-04-26 00:40:32	nibalizer	I mean if your goal here is to have one big map, you're gonna have to write that map yourself right?
2013-04-26 00:41:07	nibalizer	so why worry if you do some passing of arguments in the map?
2013-04-26 00:41:23	Epitrope	because some of the mappings I want need arguments and some don't
2013-04-26 00:41:46	nibalizer	i.e. the map is for looping over your arg and calling the function, and the map(since you're writing it yourself) can make the decision
2013-04-26 00:42:17	nibalizer	so then these are different functions?
2013-04-26 00:42:27	nibalizer	and you just want to wirte them as one, really smart function?
2013-04-26 00:42:40	nibalizer	that like, duck types its arguments to see what mode its running in?
2013-04-26 00:42:54	nibalizer	cus agian taht sounds like default paramaters
2013-04-26 00:43:05	Epitrope	I want it to be an elegant, dumb function that has no concept of mode
2013-04-26 00:43:56	nibalizer	but that takes different numbers and types of arguments?
2013-04-26 00:44:11	nibalizer	these goals seem to be difficult to have both
2013-04-26 00:45:03	Epitrope	okay, this is a portion of what I have so far: https://gist.github.com/jasonaowen/33dca37fe9af2e22eca9
2013-04-26 00:46:22	Epitrope	now what I want is to be able to add a line like `generate_tests(\&new_test($foo), %homepages)` and `generate_tests(\&new_test($bar), %all_links)`
2013-04-26 00:46:55	Epitrope	and yes, my test code is more complicated than the code it is testing -_-
2013-04-26 00:48:32	nibalizer	hey thats cool man
2013-04-26 00:48:34	nibalizer	this is a neat idea
2013-04-26 00:49:04	nibalizer	so blkperls roommate schwern is the mainatiner of the .t testing library in perl
2013-04-26 00:49:13	nibalizer	not sure if it can do this kind of stuff though
2013-04-26 00:50:30	Epitrope	right now I'm using http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/libtest-simpleunit-perl
2013-04-26 00:50:39	nibalizer	Epitrope: i dont see the error in this code though, and it relating your problm to it
2013-04-26 00:50:52	Epitrope	nibalizer: that gist is all working code
2013-04-26 00:51:10	nibalizer	and is the %links ever going to not be a hash?
2013-04-26 00:51:20	Epitrope	no
2013-04-26 00:51:50	nibalizer	so then where to we have the problem with partial application(which is jsut something nightfly called this and I am in no way sure of what it means)
2013-04-26 00:52:33	Epitrope	because I want to write a new test generator that takes three arguments instead of two, and specify one of them in the call to generate_tests
2013-04-26 00:53:16	nibalizer	huh?
2013-04-26 00:54:24	Epitrope	right now generate_tests calls the generator with the key and the value from the hash; I want to pass in a reference that includes a third parameter
2013-04-26 00:55:25	Epitrope	so where (in a not-sucky language that has named parameters) I'm doing `contains_test($k, $v)`, I want to also be able to do `contains_test($k, $v, $foo)`
2013-04-26 00:55:55	Epitrope	and have that extra argument $foo be included in the $generator reference
2013-04-26 00:56:08	nibalizer	maybe have @_ is a hash, and grab params out of that based on name?
2013-04-26 00:56:20	bkero	Oh god we're talking about perl
2013-04-26 00:56:23	 *	bkero ducks out
2013-04-26 00:56:38	nibalizer	can you try: except/rescue in perl ?
2013-04-26 00:57:02	+alevar	nibalizer: Feeling pythonic tonight?
2013-04-26 00:57:06	Epitrope	nibalizer: that question fills me with dread
2013-04-26 00:57:13	nibalizer	or more to the point can you go looking for a value by key in a hash and recover gracefully if you dont find it?
2013-04-26 00:57:30	nibalizer	alevar: uh im just having a lolperl discussion
2013-04-26 00:57:35	nibalizer	which is stimulating me mentally
2013-04-26 00:57:52	Epitrope	nibalizer: in the generate_tests function, or in the called function?
2013-04-26 00:58:00	+alevar	try: except: is very pythony
2013-04-26 00:58:16	Epitrope	alevar: no it's not, it's just standard exception handling
2013-04-26 00:58:29	Epitrope	c++ and java have the same thing
2013-04-26 00:58:46	+alevar	try { } catch(Exception e) { }
2013-04-26 00:58:48	Epitrope	nibalizer: also, I don't have a very complete understanding of how @_ works
2013-04-26 00:59:05	nightfly	It's an array
2013-04-26 00:59:24	Epitrope	nightfly: I do have some understanding of how it works.
2013-04-26 00:59:35	nightfly	Though I think madness happens when you pass non scaler arguments to functions
2013-04-26 00:59:36	nibalizer	i think its called 'easeier to ask foriveness than permission'
2013-04-26 01:00:22	nibalizer	as opposed to the c-style 'ARE YOU 4*LENGTH_OF_CHAR?, ARE YOU FROM NANTUKKET?, OKAY, IMMA TRY TO READ FROM YOU, EVERYBODY HOLD THE FUCK ON'
2013-04-26 01:00:35	Epitrope	lol, nibalizer++
2013-04-26 01:01:01	Epitrope	(except the last part happens even if the answer to the first two questions is "no")
2013-04-26 01:01:11	nibalizer	haha
2013-04-26 01:01:23	nibalizer	fuck it, better shit some unprintable shit all over nibz' 161 hw
2013-04-26 01:01:40	nibalizer	Epitrope: so i think you can have a hash as @_[0]
2013-04-26 01:01:48	Epitrope	nightfly: yeah, I discovered that when I tried to pass the hash before the function reference... that ended poorly
2013-04-26 01:01:53	nibalizer	and i think thats a relatively common thing to do to deal with your problem here
2013-04-26 01:02:15	nibalizer	why not a reference to the hash then?
2013-04-26 01:02:22	nibalizer	idunno spam references

2013-04-26 10:28:29	Epitrope	schwern: yeah, I've written several tests in it and it seems to be working fine
2013-04-26 10:29:01	Epitrope	and at the risk of more perl-bashing, "unmaintained upstream" seems to be the status quo for most of the stuff from cpan
2013-04-26 10:30:26	Epitrope	schwern: so, what testing framework should I be using instead? are there any that are mature and maintained?
2013-04-26 10:31:13	schwern	Test::Most is where to start
2013-04-26 10:31:32	schwern	CPAN has no quality requirements by design.
2013-04-26 10:31:52	schwern	Its a trade off
2013-04-26 10:32:33	schwern	In general, Perl doesn't test like most other languages.  If you want xUnit style testing (test methods, etc?) look at Test::Class.
2013-04-26 10:33:51	schwern	Epitrope: https://metacpan.org/module/Task::Kensho#Testing:-Task::Kensho::Testing provides a nice start into good Perl testing modules.
2013-04-26 10:34:04	schwern	There are 700+ of them, so it can get a bit dizzying.
2013-04-26 10:34:21	schwern	Fortunately most of them work together.

2013-04-26 10:35:00	schwern	The last release date is a good first pass measure of whether to use a CPAN module? or any other software really.

2013-04-26 10:39:06	schwern	Epitrope: Test::Most is a conglomoration of a half dozen of the most popular and useful Perl testing modules.  Read their individual man pages.  https://metacpan.org/module/Test::Most#EXPORT
2013-04-26 10:39:34	schwern	There's also Test::Tutorial to get you started.  It's a little out of date, but still useful.  https://metacpan.org/module/MSCHWERN/Test-Simple-0.98/lib/Test/Tutorial.pod
2013-04-26 10:40:08	schwern	And if you really want to do the xUnit thing, here's slides on Test::Class by the author of Test::Most.  http://www.slideshare.net/Ovid/testing-with-testclass
2013-04-26 10:40:35	Epitrope	awesome, schwern++

2013-04-26 10:41:16	schwern	http://www.slideshare.net/Ovid/a-whirlwind-tour-of-testclass might be better
2013-04-26 10:41:22	clarkb	its awesome that they write man pages. no one writes man pages anymore
2013-04-26 10:42:01	schwern	We don't write man pages. We write POD and convert them to man pages. :P
2013-04-26 10:42:37	schwern	Epitrope: The thing about Perl tests is they're just programs that print out a format called TAP.
2013-04-26 10:43:08	schwern	Test::Tutorial covers that.  Then there's something else, the harness, that runs the programs, looks at the output, and turns that into a summary for you.
2013-04-26 10:43:40	schwern	print "1..1\n";  print "ok 1\n";   # a perl test
2013-04-26 10:44:43	Epitrope	Test::SimpleUnit seems to be covering both parts of that
2013-04-26 10:44:51	schwern	Yes, that's the xUnit style.
2013-04-26 10:45:05	schwern	The test, test runner and test displayer are all in the same process.
2013-04-26 10:45:31	schwern	That's what pretty much everybody but Perl does.  It has its advantages, but it makes your tests very complicated.
2013-04-26 10:46:23	Epitrope	as contrasted with a series of `ok(foo);` statements?
2013-04-26 10:46:39	schwern	Most Perl test libraries are just variations on "if this condition is true print "ok", else print 'not ok'"
2013-04-26 10:47:20	schwern	Read Test::Tutorial and see where you're at after that.
2013-04-26 10:47:28	clarkb	(the style of testing where the test runner outputs a stream of some sort with pass fail info is awesome)
2013-04-26 10:47:31	clarkb	see subunit
2013-04-26 10:47:31	Epitrope	yep, that's what I'm looking at now

2013-04-26 11:01:20	schwern	Well, ok, there's actually two things xUnit has going for it.  First is "everything is one process" and second is "test classes and methods".
2013-04-26 11:01:54	schwern	The advantages of everything in one process is the tests, test runner and test displayer have complete information about each other and so can do some pretty cool things.
2013-04-26 11:02:53	schwern	The disadvantage is they're highly coupled.  Want a different displayer?  Sorry.  Need to write a test that doesn't load a crapton of other classes?  Sorry.  Need to do something the test framework doesn't like?  Sorry.  Need to incorporate a test in another language?  Sorry.

2013-04-26 11:03:42	schwern	To rag on Perl a bit, TAP (Test Anything Protocol) is a crappy data interchange language.  So what our test harnesses can do is very limited.  Working on that.
2013-04-26 11:04:03	schwern	Test classes and methods offer more advantages.
2013-04-26 11:04:39	schwern	Better structure.  It's easy to find and write the test for a class and the tests for a method.

2013-04-26 11:05:29	schwern	Test::Class has that, too
2013-04-26 11:05:45	schwern	The ability to say "this method will run 5 tests" is nice.  Small plans are useful.
2013-04-26 11:05:48	Epitrope	but for the moment, all I'm testing is a collection of subroutines
2013-04-26 11:06:03	schwern	Don't let "class" decieve you.
2013-04-26 11:06:25	schwern	There's nothing in Test::Class which says you have to be testing a class.

2013-04-26 11:07:44	Epitrope	can you explain a bit more about the process separation?
2013-04-26 11:07:56	schwern	You start by loading Test::More.  Then you need to test some HTML so you load Test::HTML::Content.  You need to test exceptions so add in Test::Fatal...
2013-04-26 11:08:08	schwern	What do you want to know?
2013-04-26 11:08:23	schwern	(Ironically, I'm writing a new testing class for next week right now)
2013-04-26 11:08:34	Epitrope	I guess I don't see where there's any kind of IPC
2013-04-26 11:08:42	schwern	There isn't.  Just pipes.
2013-04-26 11:08:51	schwern	Print on STDOUT
2013-04-26 11:09:32	schwern	#!/bin/sh  echo "1..1" && echo "ok 1"  # a valid test
2013-04-26 11:10:00	Epitrope	ah, maybe this is me realizing that I don't understand how the tests are laid out on the filesystem
2013-04-26 11:10:28	schwern	The standard layout is a t/ directory full of *.t files.
2013-04-26 11:10:36	schwern	But there's nothing which says you have to do that.
2013-04-26 11:11:00	schwern	There's a command line utility called "prove" which will execute tests and interpret the results.

2013-04-26 11:13:46	schwern	You've have to ask Ovid
2013-04-26 11:18:20	Epitrope	schwern: so, for perl5i, how are the tests actually run?
2013-04-26 11:19:15	schwern	Epitrope:  perl5i is a standard Perl module using Module::Build.  Instead of ./Configure; make check we have perl Build.PL; ./Build test
2013-04-26 11:19:31	schwern	But ./Build test is basically just a wrapper around "prove -lr"
2013-04-26 11:19:54	Epitrope	aha
2013-04-26 11:19:56	schwern	-l says "look for libraries in lib/" and -r says "look recursively for tests".  By default it looks in t/ for tests.
2013-04-26 11:20:11	schwern	And prove is just a wrapper around TAP::Harness.
2013-04-26 11:20:41	Epitrope	so, easy mode would be just to have t/*.t and run `prove`?
2013-04-26 11:20:52	schwern	Yes
2013-04-26 11:21:26	schwern	You usually want -l and you usually want to put your libraries in lib/

2013-04-26 12:50:55	+lewisc	and sure enough I had

2013-04-26 12:52:19	kini	the use case for , is in for loop heads
2013-04-26 12:52:40	+lewisc	kini: I am under the impression it actually has a BRICK of use cases
2013-04-26 12:52:48	kini	for (i = 0, j = 0; i < 200; i++, j+=2)
2013-04-26 12:52:49	kini	for example
2013-04-26 12:53:02	+lewisc	like, C has so much side effectful stuff going on
2013-04-26 12:53:03	kini	(OK, bad example, but whatever)
2013-04-26 12:53:22	+lewisc	yeah, that's one sort of default answer
2013-04-26 12:53:33	kini	ps if you're not using -Wall -Wextra all the time you're going to have a bad time
2013-04-26 12:53:40	+lewisc	but there's a number of libraries where you will see
2013-04-26 12:54:08	+lewisc	a = initialize(b),activateserver(c),buildobject(b,c);
2013-04-26 12:54:14	kini	rofl
2013-04-26 12:54:17	+lewisc	since we don't have real constructors
2013-04-26 12:55:07	+lewisc	and logically you want those three expressions to sort of be "linked", i.e. you do them all the same, so you could split them out on different lines, but this is arguably clearer
2013-04-26 12:56:48	kini	yup
2013-04-26 13:04:34	clarkb	just don't overload any operators. /me looks at pkg_resources

2013-04-26 13:20:50	+lewisc	pop quiz oh c afficionados greghaynes and others
2013-04-26 13:21:26	+lewisc	when returning a local struc from a function (by value) if the struct has a statically allocated array will the array be copied?
2013-04-26 13:21:59	Corbin	lewisc: Depends. Are you talking about my_array[] or *my_array[] ?
2013-04-26 13:22:23	Corbin	If it's of fixed size and actually resides within the struct (the former), then it is part of the struct's value.
2013-04-26 13:22:50	Corbin	And it will be copied with the struct. But if it's just a pointer to an array, then the pointer will be copied.
2013-04-26 13:23:34	+lewisc	uh its
2013-04-26 13:24:04	kini	Corbin: I would have thought "statically allocated array" means the former
2013-04-26 13:24:38	+lewisc	http://pastie.org/7726224
2013-04-26 13:24:55	+lewisc	fixed size static
2013-04-26 13:25:00	+lewisc	okay
2013-04-26 13:25:03	+lewisc	technically...
2013-04-26 13:25:07	+lewisc	no yeah that is static
2013-04-26 13:25:14	+lewisc	no, automatic, that's the word
2013-04-26 13:25:21	Corbin	kini: Yeah, but I don't know *where* it's allocated. :3
2013-04-26 13:25:41	Corbin	lewisc: Ah, yes. So that'll get copied along with the rest of the struct.
2013-04-26 13:25:59	Corbin	Or at least it *should*. Now I'm doubting myself. :T\
2013-04-26 13:29:23	+lewisc	gdb says it's being copied
2013-04-26 13:29:39	+lewisc	but gdb also isn't showing the internal array as being a pointer
2013-04-26 13:29:47	+lewisc	which is strange
2013-04-26 13:30:05	nibalizer	yea i was gonna say why not just do your thing on its own line
2013-04-26 13:30:11	nibalizer	oshit scrollback
2013-04-26 13:30:14	nibalizer	mybad
2013-04-26 13:30:20	nibalizer	are we staill talking about the comma?
2013-04-26 13:33:05	kini	lewisc: why would the internal array be a pointer? it's stored directly in the struct, isn't it?
2013-04-26 13:33:45	+lewisc	nibalizer: no, but yes, you can completely do that. It's n old idiosyncracy of the language that has some debateable stylistic reasons for existing
2013-04-26 13:33:50	+lewisc	kini: yeah
2013-04-26 13:34:04	 *	lewisc doesn't know the EXACT layout rules of static structs in C
2013-04-26 13:34:20	+lewisc	as they are an abomination of complexity
2013-04-26 13:34:40	+lewisc	and without knowing them this gets weird
2013-04-26 13:35:02	+lewisc	because returning a static struct will return a pointer
2013-04-26 13:35:24	+lewisc	I want to say this violates the principle of least surprise, but I don't think there's anything that would be better
2013-04-26 13:35:28	+lewisc	anyways, thanks guys

2013-04-26 14:10:01	clarkb	there are layout rules for structs in C?
2013-04-26 14:10:09	clarkb	I thought that was an implementation detail
2013-04-26 14:10:14	clarkb	which is why you have to use offset of and friends
2013-04-26 14:10:18	Corbin	clarkb: C99, man.
2013-04-26 14:10:46	Corbin	clarkb: C99 lets you e.g. put an array of varying size as the last member of a struct, and have the struct's size vary with the size of the array.
2013-04-26 14:13:12	clarkb	does it specify concrete offsets for everything?

2013-04-26 14:28:04	+lewisc	clarkb: there are rules. Some of those rules say "it's up to the implementation", others specify semantics and say "however you get this behavior, have at it", and others actually say "if you have x and y, the memory for x is above the memory for y
2013-04-26 14:29:12	+lewisc	now hilariously, as in that last example, gcc mostly considers this stuff to be "guidelines" rather than rules, and I believe at -O3 and above will do completely it's own thing that probably has similar-ish semantics to what is specified
2013-04-26 14:30:01	+lewisc	wait, that 3 pyramid thing is from Zelda?
2013-04-26 14:30:05	+lewisc	that explains....
2013-04-26 14:30:07	+lewisc	a lot
2013-04-26 14:30:09	clarkb	lewisc: but your alignment is totally unknown right?
2013-04-26 14:30:20	clarkb	I mean you can say X then Y then Z but you don't know how many bits end up between each one
2013-04-26 14:30:32	+lewisc	Ithink it's known given other parameters
2013-04-26 14:30:43	+lewisc	like, the width of the elements
2013-04-26 14:31:03	clarkb	given a compiler you know these things
2013-04-26 14:31:16	clarkb	but the language itself doesn't care
2013-04-26 14:31:33	+lewisc	I am not sure
2013-04-26 14:31:40	+lewisc	but I believe the language sort of cares
2013-04-26 14:31:54	+lewisc	two compilers on the exact same system should give similar alignments
2013-04-26 14:32:04	+lewisc	actually...
2013-04-26 14:32:08	+lewisc	no it is known
2013-04-26 14:32:27	+lewisc	but you have to know the bitwidth of the system
2013-04-26 14:32:33	+lewisc	otherwise interop wouldn't work?
2013-04-26 14:32:38	 *	lewisc is kind of guessing there
2013-04-26 14:32:46	clarkb	interop?
2013-04-26 14:33:02	+lewisc	Java can call C code
2013-04-26 14:33:48	+lewisc	it does so by shoving an object onto the stack and then passing control off to another function
2013-04-26 14:34:57	+lewisc	I mean, I am pretty sure you can link against code from a different compiler
2013-04-26 14:35:17	+lewisc	but I am not sure if that's just because everyone does stuff the gcc way or if there is actually a standard

2013-04-26 14:38:16	+lewisc	wikipedia is vague on the topic other than several major compilers do use the same alignment
2013-04-26 14:38:19	+lewisc	I dunno
2013-04-26 14:39:04	+lewisc	I thought it was specified and parameterized against some system specs (pointer size, stack details etc.) but that might have been misinformation on my part
2013-04-26 14:39:18	clarkb	I think it ends up being by convention and not by any hard rule
2013-04-26 14:39:33	clarkb	similar to how yo udon't throw exception across libraries in C++
2013-04-26 14:39:36	clarkb	it might work

2013-05-02 12:54:54	bkero	Hint: The apache software foundation has a lot more than just a web server.
2013-05-02 12:55:17	Corbin	They also have walls and walls of Java, and everybody speaks Java.

2013-05-02 12:57:07	Corbin	Pfft, sunny spots.
2013-05-02 12:57:14	bkero	corbin is not a fan of catnaps
2013-05-02 12:57:18	Corbin	Although it *is* sunny in Seattle today.

2013-05-02 12:57:40	bkero	Corbin: but never sunny catnaps, always nerdcave catnaps
2013-05-02 12:57:42	noirin	I have a shady spot, which is more suited to my skin :-)

2013-05-02 13:04:07	Corbin	I should propose projects to fill that gap.
2013-05-02 13:04:15	Corbin	Like, say, Apache Yippy Dog.

2013-05-02 13:04:33	Corbin	I don't know what it would *do*, but OTOH I'm not sure what about half of the Apache family does.
2013-05-02 13:04:40	Corbin	noirin: Sorry, already left school.
2013-05-02 13:05:04	Corbin	...And probably gonna get dragged into mentoring something for somebody else. Curses.

2013-05-02 21:58:34	flux	okay thanks
2013-05-02 22:14:32	sabreman	I'm just wondering
2013-05-02 22:14:57	sabreman	is there any reason why my virtual machine wouldnt be able to create a 15,000x15,000 int matrix? It's stack size is set to "unlimited"
2013-05-02 22:15:04	sabreman	and it has 4 gigs ram alocated to it.
2013-05-02 22:15:10	sabreman	is there something i'm missing?
2013-05-02 22:15:20	sabreman	it can only do 1447x1447
2013-05-02 22:19:49	MaddHatter	it depends on how the matrix is implemented. It's quite possible you don't have more than 1GB of contiguous free memory.
2013-05-02 22:20:29	MaddHatter	although 1447 is only about 10MB, which should be quite reasonable
2013-05-02 22:22:19	sabreman	nvm im an idiot

2013-05-04 22:40:23	pilgrimd	Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2013-05-04 22:40:33	pilgrimd	I like the Pfeiffer books way better.
2013-05-04 23:23:14	Wren	pilgrimd: were you in the class that was taught from her from the start?
2013-05-04 23:24:22	pilgrimd	I don't recall
2013-05-04 23:25:41	Wren	Mine was originally taught by Wint Dillon, but in the second week, she took over.
2013-05-04 23:25:46	Wren	Not sure what happened
2013-05-04 23:28:51	pilgrimd	probably low enrollment
2013-05-04 23:30:54	Wren	The first day of class Dillon actually did send out an email saying that there was a delay with d2l, but that s/he would have it up soon. Then Mitchell sent out the email saying that she had found out she was taking over the course.
2013-05-04 23:31:09	Wren	The classlist looks standard length.

2013-05-05 15:25:21	sabreman	It needs to be a biggener tutorial, if possible.
2013-05-05 15:48:20	greghaynes	programming achievement unlocked - made use of the superfast reciprocal sqrt function
2013-05-05 15:56:22	sabreman	lol the one on wikipedia?

2013-05-05 15:56:58	greghaynes	nah, I thought best not to :p
2013-05-05 15:57:01	sabreman	awww
2013-05-05 15:57:19	greghaynes	I then noticed it doesnt work on arm floating point
2013-05-05 15:58:03	greghaynes	or maybe it was just something not getting initialised right on arm vs x86
2013-05-05 16:57:58	sabreman	nvm, I've found a good opengl tutorial. www.open.gl
2013-05-05 17:29:05	greghaynes	this is just intro but its a pretty well known intro http://www.lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/
2013-05-05 17:29:28	greghaynes	In my experience knowing the lib itself isnt much of the work
2013-05-05 17:29:40	greghaynes	more about knowing the algos / data structures needed to do what youre trying to get done

2013-05-05 22:07:09	bkero	virtualenv is nice, although I'm not sure about long term use in production
2013-05-05 22:07:15	bkero	Certainly nice for development
2013-05-05 22:07:30	mythmon	I think that is how SUMO is deployed.
2013-05-05 22:07:32	bkero	Many of those packages i virtualenv need compiling and do some dirty things with static filepaths
2013-05-05 22:07:50	mythmon	naughty packages are naughty.
2013-05-05 22:08:03	bkero	Naughty packages don't get ito system package managers
2013-05-05 22:08:05	mythmon	they would be naughty from the system package manager too.

2013-05-05 22:10:52	mythmon	that being said, the dependencies of most node.js packages are silly.
2013-05-05 22:23:57	clarkb	did someone say that npm fixed their cert problems? (better to have cert problems than do everything without ssl yay python)
2013-05-05 22:26:28	clarkb	and anything that resolves a dependency tree instead of simply installing things in order is an improvement over python
2013-05-05 22:27:30	 *	bkero notes these problems have been solved for two decades.
2013-05-05 22:28:04	mythmon	sure. and repackaging everything for every distribution makes a lot of sense.
2013-05-05 22:28:37	bkero	There are conditionals in all the packages either way
2013-05-05 22:29:04	bkero	and the tools have been written to make that a trivial problem

2013-05-07 12:12:06	bkero	It's called 95th percentile
2013-05-07 12:23:46	Corbin	Also a Minecraft server would take up just as much CPU as a folder.

2013-05-07 17:05:48	Corbin	That is a *motto*. A guideline, really.
2013-05-07 17:05:51	noirin	Google was never "do no evil". It was "don't be evil" for a while, but that seems to have gone by the wayside
2013-05-07 17:06:45	Corbin	Let's just say that they probably cast Detect Evil on me as part of the interview process.

2013-05-07 17:08:10	kini	speaking of "no evil", trivia fact: the three "no evil" monkeys are actually a pun in classical Japanese, because negative conjugation of verbs (i.e. "do not") ends in a couple syllables that sound like the word for "monkey"

2013-05-07 22:47:04	sectoidman3	why would you even buy life insurance?
2013-05-07 22:47:21	sectoidman3	I mean, if you have dependents or a significant other or something, maybe, I guess
2013-05-07 22:48:48	bkero	http://cdn3.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/220660/ss_3cc0152915f773c4d8303d21e9093c1bb009265a.600x338.jpg?t=1367000911 >_>
2013-05-07 22:49:15	sectoidman3	I don't know; I get a policy for free through my work, I put my cat down as the beneficiary
2013-05-07 22:49:59	clarkb	sectoidman3: dieing is expensive
2013-05-07 22:50:28	sectoidman3	well, if you go for the big fancy funeral, I guess
2013-05-07 22:50:40	bkero	sectoidman3: ever price out cremation?
2013-05-07 22:50:50	sectoidman3	but I mean, you'll be dead; it's not like you're going to care
2013-05-07 22:51:05	bkero	sectoidman3: Other people still have to clean up your shit
2013-05-07 22:51:09	sectoidman3	true
2013-05-07 22:52:05	pilgrimd	If you don't want to name a beneficiary, name your estate and create a will that provides payments to cover death expenses.
2013-05-07 22:52:53	sectoidman3	supposing someone died dirt poor with no living relatives?
2013-05-07 22:53:23	sectoidman3	I mean, I'm assuming the state would do something about the corpse
2013-05-07 22:54:25	pilgrimd	No, but if you don't have an obvious beneficiary, you can have the life insurance pay into your estate and thus inherited by whomever should you not get the policy changed before you develop PZS.
2013-05-07 22:56:05	clarkb	ignoring inheritance I'm guessing most people have at least one other person in the world that could benefit from such a thing
2013-05-07 22:57:00	clarkb	parents, siblings, friends, roommates, significant others. Dependency is not a prereq
2013-05-07 23:15:42	kini	<sectoidman3> why would you even buy life insurance?
2013-05-07 23:15:51	kini	to pay for alcor to freeze your head when you die, obviously...................................................................................

2013-05-08 20:08:57	MaddHatter	which, despite the ugliness of the code, seems a better approach than if (foo) { foo() } else if (foo2) { foo2() } etc.

2013-05-09 19:40:51	pyro	whaa
2013-05-09 19:41:02	greghaynes	usually something like a raspi isnt friendly to oss, and is a pain to run bare metal code on
2013-05-09 19:41:23	pyro	where's the pain come from?
2013-05-09 19:41:34	greghaynes	so you have to run a full os, like linux. but linux realtime isnt good enough for flight control systems
2013-05-09 19:42:05	greghaynes	the pain is that the chip itself is undocumented
2013-05-09 19:42:09	pyro	why do you need an os?
2013-05-09 19:42:30	greghaynes	because you dont know how to make pins turn on and off, and theres no actual code out there to show you how
2013-05-09 19:43:01	pyro	:| how does the os know? manufactorer is only providing drivers?
2013-05-09 19:43:47	greghaynes	yea, binary blobs
2013-05-09 19:43:56	pyro	screw that!
2013-05-09 19:44:03	pyro	you need this hardware? :|
2013-05-09 19:44:04	greghaynes	some of it can be reverse engineered, but basically its not easy
2013-05-09 19:44:14	pyro	get a better hardware!
2013-05-09 19:44:30	greghaynes	welp, beaglebone is the onle one ive seen that fits the niche for this

2013-05-09 19:44:50	bkero	I was unclear on that
2013-05-09 19:44:53	pyro	Tach bkero
2013-05-09 19:44:56	bkero	rt is a big part
2013-05-09 19:45:00	bkero	specifically
2013-05-09 19:45:33	greghaynes	theres a lot of cases, the simplest one is the watchdoc
2013-05-09 19:45:36	greghaynes	er, watchdog
2013-05-09 19:45:38	pyro	greghaynes: what features of beaglebone are you rellying on?
2013-05-09 19:45:51	greghaynes	so you want to be able to notice "ocrap I hardlocked, reboot!"
2013-05-09 19:45:58	greghaynes	that doesnt work in midair with linux
2013-05-09 19:46:07	greghaynes	you want something like <1ms reboot time
2013-05-09 19:46:17	bkero	Aren't those usually done in hardware for serious purposes?
2013-05-09 19:46:27	greghaynes	no way
2013-05-09 19:46:33	greghaynes	this is a super common thing
2013-05-09 19:46:54	greghaynes	pyro: basically ram
2013-05-09 19:49:08	bkero	All rhe server and networking hardware warchdogs aren't really done in software
2013-05-09 19:49:23	pyro	greghaynes: are you writing a loadrer for linux drivers? :O
2013-05-09 19:50:15	greghaynes	yea, because the level of complexity there is crazy, and probably for the reason I mentioned. for robotics and industrial control devices this is the norm though
2013-05-09 19:50:34	greghaynes	pyro: psh no
2013-05-09 19:51:18	bkero	iirc the rtlinux system just swaps over to a new kernel and memory set, it keeps a second kernel loaded in memory, is that transition slower than 1ms?
2013-05-09 19:51:21	pyro	you arn't using the drivers the manufactorer gives you?
2013-05-09 19:52:06	greghaynes	that sounds like a fun idea, might work. Id definitely avoid something that complex like the plague though
2013-05-09 19:52:29	greghaynes	pyro: I am, for beaglebone Ti releases all sorts of C code
2013-05-09 19:53:26	 *	pyro is confused
2013-05-09 19:53:46	pyro	i thought you needed an linux becuase you didn't know how to set pins
2013-05-09 19:53:53	greghaynes	for non beaglebone
2013-05-09 19:53:55	greghaynes	yes
2013-05-09 19:53:58	pyro	oh :D
2013-05-09 19:54:18	pyro	so you don't need an linux for beaglebone?
2013-05-09 19:54:18	bkero	seems to work fpr a bunch of indistrial automation :)
2013-05-09 19:54:29	pyro	but you want to write an os for it?
2013-05-09 19:54:50	greghaynes	basically I want something I can make super realtime and still have >100mb ram

2013-05-09 19:55:49	greghaynes	My trying to use rt linux devolved into discovering I need to write the whole thing as a kernel module and then use tons of hacks to get the thing to startup in a sane manner, likely resulying in a custom bootloader
2013-05-09 19:55:53	greghaynes	or, I could just make something simple

2013-05-09 20:00:33	greghaynes	yea, so even when open hardware wasnt an option, its easier to use two where one was just control and the second is linux than to use rt linux
2013-05-09 20:01:23	bkero	but weight :(
2013-05-09 20:01:48	greghaynes	psh, not an issue for a the type of microprocessor you need for control
2013-05-09 20:02:05	greghaynes	the beaglebone has like 2 of them on there that we use for things like power management
2013-05-09 20:02:54	bkero	I can't imagine those bpards draw more than 1w
2013-05-09 20:03:22	greghaynes	a bit more but not much, its there so they can run that instead when you go into super low power mode, then use it to wake up main proc

2013-05-09 20:10:23	sectoidman4	http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2418764,00.asp
2013-05-09 20:11:18	sectoidman4	this really doesn't seem like a productive move, since 1. a one-shot-only plastic gun doesn't exactly have much military utility and 2. they tried this with encryption back in the 90s and it didn't work then either
2013-05-09 20:30:59	+alevar	I know there's no authoritative answer to this, but which distro should I go for for a server that I'll have to pass off to someone else?
2013-05-09 20:31:36	sectoidman4	whichever one they ask for, I guess
2013-05-09 20:31:44	stacybird	I should think that would depend on the someone else in part
2013-05-09 20:32:43	+alevar	I'm not sure if they'll know, and I won't be able to discuss it for a while.
2013-05-09 20:33:11	clarkb	ubuntu precise, debian, or centos
2013-05-09 20:33:21	+alevar	Debian stable?
2013-05-09 20:33:42	clarkb	yeah. I mean each of those choices aren't particularly terrible for any reason
2013-05-09 20:38:37	+alevar	I'll go with Debian. That will give access to more packages that are more up to date.
2013-05-09 20:44:05	kini	debian++ (debian stable)++
2013-05-09 20:46:48	sectoidman4	debian's great, but i'm not sure i'd call stable 'up to date'
2013-05-09 20:47:22	clarkb	sectoidman4: right now its not too bad since they just released
2013-05-09 20:48:03	jesusaurus	whats debians release cycle?
2013-05-09 20:49:40	clarkb	seems to be about once every 2 years

2013-05-09 21:25:16	sabreman	if so, how difficult was the midterm?
2013-05-09 21:25:35	sabreman	Like, was it mostly regurgitation, or was there a lot of actual thinking involved
2013-05-09 21:42:47	nightfly	I took it from $RANDOM_PERSON. It was largely programming assignment oriented

2013-05-12 12:21:14	+alevar	We only really have one time where we can physically meet.
2013-05-12 12:24:08	Lycopene	A lot of email. My group also used google hangout/skype when people couldn't come in.
2013-05-12 12:24:50	Lycopene	You could try irc but that's just a hassle if people aren't familar with it..

2013-05-12 12:47:53	+alevar	There hasn't really been much communication within the group so far. Is that pretty normal at this point (6 weeks into the term), or should I start getting worried?
2013-05-12 12:52:23	clarkb	depends do you have a project yet? if so start communicating
2013-05-12 12:58:19	kini	does a pdf of hein exist somewhere

2013-05-12 13:04:51	+alevar	clarkb: We have a project, but haven't met with the sponsor besides an email that the project leader forwarded to us.
2013-05-12 13:06:59	kini	the review on amazon for the first volume says "the language of the original English is the epitome of clarity so IMO you might as well save 159000 yen and buy a used copy of the english version instead of waiting for all three volumes of this translation to come out"
2013-05-12 13:07:12	kini	interesting considering all I've heard from PSU students is how incomprehensible the book is, haha
2013-05-12 13:07:52	+alevar	We'll be meeting with the sponsor tomorrow, so hopefully I can get a  few details that I need to start getting basic infrastructure set up.
2013-05-12 13:07:54	clarkb	I kept it
2013-05-12 13:08:29	+alevar	'Cause there ain't nothin' quite like a good testing setup to warm your heart as you start a project.
2013-05-12 13:08:35	clarkb	was better for compilers than the compiler book

2013-05-12 13:23:23	+alevar	It'll be my first time doing the setup for testing, as opposed to just using it.
2013-05-12 13:24:15	+alevar	I'd like to use Flask (Python web framework) if possible. It has helpers for unit testing built straight into the framework.
2013-05-12 13:25:52	clarkb	testools testresources and python-fixtures are full of win

2013-05-12 13:55:53	kini	(probably the reason people downvoted the review was not because they think hein is unclear but because they think the reviewer is being presumptuous in saying that any random Japanese person would be able to read the English original)

2013-05-12 20:52:01	pilgrimd	A dozen slides, don't need to worry about too much details.
2013-05-12 21:01:16	aleph	I've done the prep and I've winged it. Can't say one has worked out better than the other. At least for the short ones.
2013-05-12 21:05:24	pilgrimd	For this one I needed to include a references slide, so research and prep was required.
2013-05-12 21:06:05	pilgrimd	Still, was fun gathering a bit of data and forming an "economic act utilitarian" argument for how to make corporations DTRT.

2013-05-12 21:10:01	aleph	Oh, there was prep. Even for the short ones. Just the character & intensity differed between the two. Mostly for the short prep => read over the material enough to understand it then make the slides as bullet points to jog my memory and just talk about it.
2013-05-12 21:10:26	aleph	For the longer ones => a lot more structure and practice.
2013-05-12 21:11:11	pilgrimd	Yeah the slides are as much my talking points as anything
2013-05-12 21:12:16	aleph	When I'm winging it the path through the material differs between giving the same talk on the same material.

2013-05-13 16:12:47	MaddHatter	I've never understood the whole "you have >|  |< much sick time" thing. The nature of sick is that it's unpredictable, and so there's no way to plan a fixed amount of time for it
2013-05-13 16:12:48	clarkb	you don't just work from bed when sick? I probably work too much
2013-05-13 16:13:05	MaddHatter	if you try to ration it, you just encourage sick people to show up at work and make everyone else sick
2013-05-13 16:13:18	MaddHatter	or if you give too much, to use it as vacation, in which case why not just make it vacation.
2013-05-13 16:13:37	Corbin	Exactly.
2013-05-13 16:13:40	greghaynes	yea, I tend to get the coolest stuff done while sick in bed
2013-05-13 16:13:45	Corbin	My boss tells me to stay home if I'm sick.
2013-05-13 16:13:57	Corbin	Otherwise the whole office gets sick.
2013-05-13 16:13:58	Kraytul	does staying home mean you don't work?
2013-05-13 16:14:18	Corbin	Depends on the amount of incapaciation involved. I got work done when I only had a sore throat.
2013-05-13 16:14:36	greghaynes	It depends, a lot of stuff yes because the communication issue sometimes means id probably be more of a hinderence than help
2013-05-13 16:14:41	Kraytul	but what about the fever spirits that help you write code? :P
2013-05-13 16:14:45	MaddHatter	I can work just as well from home (or anywhere with internet) as at work, so I usually get at least some work done while out sick

2013-05-13 16:31:27	greghaynes	we should just start using that
2013-05-13 16:31:29	bkero	Google wave was good, but not as good as IRC.
2013-05-13 16:31:37	eidolon	wave was sweet (except that whole complete lack of meaningful access control part)
2013-05-13 16:31:46	eidolon	also IRC UBER ALLES
2013-05-13 16:32:11	bkero	Humans will still be using IRC when we are a spare faring race.
2013-05-13 16:32:12	MaddHatter	(not that we're biased, of course)
2013-05-13 16:32:43	MaddHatter	I made this a vector instead of a map? What the hell was I thinking?
2013-05-13 16:32:49	clarkb	between a review tool, a test tool, logs, etherpad, paste, irc, mail lists, wiki, static documentation and object storage for file sharing we do fairly well
2013-05-13 16:32:51	eidolon	bkero: god I hope so
2013-05-13 16:33:03	eidolon	without IRC space travel would be HELLA boring
2013-05-13 16:33:15	bkero	The farthest that humans have gone from Earth has been the far side of the moon.
2013-05-13 16:38:22	MaddHatter	and they didn't have IRC over there. It's obvious why we've never ventured further.
2013-05-13 16:39:06	Ac-town	you'll just have to wait days for a reply
2013-05-13 16:39:18	Ac-town	but now that I think about it that sounds like irc today
2013-05-13 16:39:20	bkero	Nah, seconds
2013-05-13 16:39:30	Ac-town	if we go past that
2013-05-13 16:39:33	bkero	Depends on how far you are. The speed of light is some fast shit.
2013-05-13 16:39:36	bkero	But distances can be big
2013-05-13 16:39:43	Ac-town	once we get into ds9 then yeah
2013-05-13 16:39:45	Ac-town	days
2013-05-13 16:40:00	bkero	Ac-town: You've seen Steins;gate.
2013-05-13 16:40:05	bkero	Do that shit.
2013-05-13 16:40:05	mythmon	at that point irc doesn't make sense anymore.
2013-05-13 16:40:07	Kraytul	subspace irc :D
2013-05-13 16:40:12	mythmon	Hell, TCP doesn't make sense anymore.
2013-05-13 16:40:27	bkero	mythmon: waiting for NASA to publish their mars rover protocol on github
2013-05-13 16:40:57	Ac-town	do what from s;g?
2013-05-13 16:41:10	MaddHatter	bkero: I've heard that it's just TCP, but with timeouts made insanely long
2013-05-13 16:41:22	Corbin	We've already got a great protocol for talking across high-latency gaps.
2013-05-13 16:41:27	Corbin	Remember traditional letter writing?
2013-05-13 16:41:46	bkero	Corbin: The question is do we spam multiple copies or just ack?
2013-05-13 16:41:51	mythmon	MaddHatter: interesting.
2013-05-13 16:41:57	Corbin	You would write a letter: Dear Alice, A. B. C? D? Sincerely, Bob.
2013-05-13 16:42:07	bkero	https://github.com/nasa/mct
2013-05-13 16:42:08	Corbin	And then seal and sign.
2013-05-13 16:42:31	Corbin	And then Alice replies: Dear Bob, C. D. E? F? G? Sincerely, Alice.
2013-05-13 16:42:40	Corbin	You have to have massive batching.
2013-05-13 16:44:30	greghaynes	tcp seeeriously doesnt make sense....
2013-05-13 16:44:52	bkero	Why are we doig all of this speculation when it's probably published on the internet?
2013-05-13 16:44:54	greghaynes	it is a serious braintease figuring out how to get any type of bandwidth over a couple minute latency connection
2013-05-13 16:45:00	greghaynes	it is published
2013-05-13 16:45:25	bkero	http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/secure_space_communication.html
2013-05-13 16:45:46	greghaynes	the secret is to duplicate your data enroute to things in space then use those to buffer/error correct a bunch
2013-05-13 16:45:56	greghaynes	since you can ptp between them with much higher snr
2013-05-13 16:46:08	bkero	digipeaters
2013-05-13 16:46:33	bkero	APRS does the same thing :)

2013-05-13 16:53:13	clarkb	isn't the next ip version being worked on specifically to handle interplanetary ip?
2013-05-13 16:53:18	clarkb	greghaynes: ^
2013-05-13 16:53:26	bkero	IPv7 has an interplanetary header bit
2013-05-13 16:53:27	nibalizer	sounds like BS to me?
2013-05-13 16:53:31	bkero	Err, intergalactic
2013-05-13 16:53:32	greghaynes	lol
2013-05-13 16:53:41	nibalizer	pulsars will be the new routers
2013-05-13 16:53:41	greghaynes	now thats just silly

2013-05-13 16:53:53	clarkb	or something
2013-05-13 16:54:00	bkero	Imagine how fat that pipe would need to be.
2013-05-13 16:54:16	Kraytul	probably about black-hole sized :3
2013-05-13 16:54:44	bkero	Perhaps all the light we're receiving on earth now is actually data encoded into energy and blasted away as point-to-point, we just happen to catch strays.
2013-05-13 16:54:54	bkero	We're just too dumb to look for the checksums.
2013-05-13 16:55:01	greghaynes	pass the bong, man
2013-05-13 16:55:09	clarkb	bkero: isn't that what the seti arrays are looking for?
2013-05-13 16:55:19	bkero	greghaynes: My bong, you get your own.
2013-05-13 16:55:34	Kraytul	don't screw up the rotation!
2013-05-13 16:55:36	clarkb	not cool

2013-05-14 17:32:55	 *	nightfly is going to NodePDX
2013-05-14 17:39:13	+alevar	nightfly: Is it a bad idea to have a Puppet Master that is available publicly?
2013-05-14 17:39:51	+alevar	As in, available to the general Internet.
2013-05-14 17:40:11	nightfly	I've done it, it can get DOS'd pretty easily but it your certs are big enough I'm not sure how much of a security risk it would be.
2013-05-14 17:40:29	nightfly	Actually, my puppet masters world accessible right now
2013-05-14 17:40:38	+alevar	cool
2013-05-14 17:40:56	blkperl	its a bad idea and you should both feel bad :P
2013-05-14 17:41:06	+alevar	serious or not?
2013-05-14 17:42:23	+alevar	I'm thinking of using Puppet for the test & production environments for my senior capstone, so I'm trying to figure out the deployment details.
2013-05-14 17:43:02	blkperl	you should only allow clients that need to connect to it to have accesss
2013-05-14 17:43:22	+alevar	So should I distribute manifest files?
2013-05-14 17:43:57	nightfly	you can also firewall it or tunnel it over ssh
2013-05-14 17:44:09	blkperl	use a firewall, or tunnerl, or vpn
2013-05-14 17:45:03	+alevar	Is it a terrible idea to distribute manifests instead?
2013-05-14 17:45:26	+alevar	I want to make this as simple as possible for the other group members.
2013-05-14 17:45:38	clarkb	nightfly: alevar: our master is available publicly. Works fine if you don't default trust nodes
2013-05-14 17:45:59	clarkb	blkperl: whats bad about it?
2013-05-14 17:46:52	blkperl	clarkb: exploit has been posted on the internets, local user can get root, most modern kernels are affected
2013-05-14 17:46:53	clarkb	alevar: we used to just git clone and puppet apply locally on our boxes, but that is clunky when it comes to private data
2013-05-14 17:47:11	blkperl	clarkb: oh wrong channel, got confused by context :)
2013-05-14 17:47:17	clarkb	blkperl: what does that have to do with allowing your puppet master to talk on the internet?
2013-05-14 17:47:27	clarkb	obviously if there is an exploit in puppet you want to deal with that
2013-05-14 17:50:48	clarkb	alevar: I think `git clone && puppet apply` is pretty simple
2013-05-14 17:50:58	+alevar	hmmm
2013-05-14 17:52:16	clarkb	alevar: do you not get 4 workstations and a server anymore?
2013-05-14 17:53:13	+alevar	I'm not sure what we'll get.
2013-05-14 17:53:38	+alevar	I don't think workstations will happen. I think Warren's trying to have people use laptops.
2013-05-14 17:53:53	clarkb	if you still get a server those are super useful
2013-05-14 17:54:08	clarkb	we just put everything on that one box and did local backups to the workstations iirc
2013-05-14 17:54:21	clarkb	and the important code bits were on launchpad
2013-05-14 17:54:24	+alevar	We haven't figured out the details of hosting.

2013-05-14 21:32:18	retrov	the built-in HTTP server isn't useful for anything but testing and a few clients

2013-05-15 16:51:14	Corbin	TIL Windows is horrible.
2013-05-15 16:51:20	+askore	today?
2013-05-15 16:51:27	Corbin	So y'know how, when you exec() on a UNIX-like system --
2013-05-15 16:51:31	Corbin	askore: Hush. :3
2013-05-15 16:51:36	+askore	:)
2013-05-15 16:51:41	Corbin	So, exec() takes an argv array, right?
2013-05-15 16:51:57	Corbin	And this means that you don't have to shell-escape or anything like that.
2013-05-15 16:52:01	Kraytul	haha
2013-05-15 16:52:23	Corbin	Well, Windows doesn't have that. Instead, Windows simply passes a single string to the process, consisting of all characters passed to it.
2013-05-15 16:52:36	Corbin	And then the process gets to split off its argv as it chooses.
2013-05-15 16:53:06	Corbin	This *also* means that things like globbing aren't done by the shell. Instead, they're done by the target process.
2013-05-15 16:53:09	clarkb	also no fork
2013-05-15 16:53:28	Corbin	On Linux: ["ls", "*"] -> ls a.c b.c c.c
2013-05-15 16:53:38	Corbin	Er.
2013-05-15 16:53:53	+alevar	Pretty sure the shell doesn't necessarily do globbing
2013-05-15 16:54:01	Corbin	On Windows: ["ls", "*"] -> "ls *"
2013-05-15 16:54:06	clarkb	it does
2013-05-15 16:54:15	+askore	it's called "shell globbing" so
2013-05-15 16:54:30	Corbin	alevar: UNIX shells don't *have to* glob, but they usually do. It's their job to do it, at least.

2013-05-15 17:02:15	karmabot	Yes, kini.
2013-05-15 17:12:43	MaddHatter	fork() is weird.
2013-05-15 17:13:31	MaddHatter	we're used to it, but the idea that a new process should be a clone of yourself and inherit everything you have is not natural.
2013-05-15 17:14:57	MaddHatter	windows doesn't have a shell (in the sense that *nix does), so it's no surprise that glob expansion would be done by the commands that wanted to use them
2013-05-15 17:15:20	MaddHatter	but it does mean glob-expansion can be inconsistent between different processes (e.g. ls vs grep vs whatever)
2013-05-15 17:16:21	greghaynes	not to mention the hax that go into making most fork calls not be a total waste of cpu
2013-05-15 17:16:50	clarkb	but it turns out fork works really well once you ahve those hax
2013-05-15 17:17:20	clarkb	its super useful to get your parents file descriptors and to be a read only copy of your parent
2013-05-15 17:17:27	clarkb	"read only"
2013-05-15 17:19:15	MaddHatter	CreateProcess() has flags that allow inheriting some things. (Not everything, and I don't recall the details of what can inherit and what can't.)
2013-05-15 17:22:08	clarkb	fork enables really neat things like systemd/inetds socket activation and in the case of systemd this means you can "start" more services in parallel without wasting resources on them until they are needed
2013-05-15 17:23:07	MaddHatter	oh, start process, listen, fork a bunch and just do nothing in the children until they're needed?
2013-05-15 17:23:44	clarkb	MaddHatter: no systemd opens the sockets that the daemon's config says it needs then waits for actual connection on them before forking
2013-05-15 17:24:17	clarkb	this way you can start all of your services in parallel then they sort out actually start ordred by communicating with each other (something does need to be started normally to kick everything off)
2013-05-15 17:24:51	clarkb	basically you don't wait for service foo to say it is ready you just open service foo's sockets and start the things that depend on foo
2013-05-15 17:25:07	clarkb	then when things connect to foo you spin it up
2013-05-15 17:25:57	MaddHatter	that seems to assume everything important is initiated by a socket connection, which is probably true for some cases, but not everything.
2013-05-15 17:27:25	clarkb	thats true, however a great many things use sockets now
2013-05-15 17:27:29	MaddHatter	if it takes longer than $timeout for foo to get itself into a ready state, then you have to force the old-style startup, I assume
2013-05-15 17:27:50	clarkb	yeah it still boils down to configuring it per service, but you have the option
2013-05-15 17:27:57	clarkb	and it relies on fork to make it sane
2013-05-15 17:28:12	MaddHatter	yeah, the socket hand-off is difficult otherwise
2013-05-15 17:28:27	MaddHatter	although being able to hand-off sockets across processes (and even across servers) would be a really nice feature
2013-05-15 17:28:55	clarkb	fork is also how you do upgrades without restarting your connections
2013-05-15 17:29:04	clarkb	etc. fork is useful
2013-05-15 17:30:11	MaddHatter	there are fork implementations for windows. That's a lot of what cygwin provides.
2013-05-15 17:30:48	MaddHatter	damn it. making popcorn in offices should be illegal. Illegal! I say.
2013-05-15 17:51:10	bajr	karmabot: popcorn

2013-05-15 20:28:37	sabreman	firstly to get assembly compile with the -S flag for g++ (capital s)
2013-05-15 20:29:01	sabreman	secondly, don't compile with the debug flag (-g) otehrwise you get a shitton of bs assembly that you dont need

2013-05-17 10:16:05	sabreman	Just wondering, is anyone going down to OSU on the 22nd for intervies?
2013-05-17 10:33:30	clarkb	is that MECOP?
2013-05-17 10:34:52	sabreman	yea
2013-05-17 10:35:20	clarkb	I'm not, but did it years ago
2013-05-17 10:35:24	sabreman	it looks like i'll be needing a ride back. Otherwise i'd have to stick around there for like 4 hours.
2013-05-17 10:35:27	sabreman	:/
2013-05-17 10:35:31	retrov	bkero: i'm surprised that aspect of our immigration laws doesn't get more discussion in Congress

2013-05-17 10:37:24	clarkb	sabreman: they still have mail lists right? you might try asking there too
2013-05-17 10:37:34	clarkb	or maybe mail lists happen later

2013-05-18 00:39:05	karmabot	K, kini.
2013-05-18 00:41:12	Kona	Corbin, my favorite installment yet.
2013-05-18 00:47:40	bkero	I still have to see Evangelion 3.33
2013-05-18 00:47:58	bkero	I have downlaoded it already. I am an abject failure for not watching.
2013-05-18 00:49:13	kini	I'm waiting for 4 to come out, then I'll marathon rebuild I guess
2013-05-18 00:49:59	bkero	2, 3, and 4 are completely different stories
2013-05-18 00:50:20	bkero	2 is kind of related to the series, but very tangentally and is completely new by the end
2013-05-18 00:50:46	bkero	kini: if you're looking for something to tide you over while you wait, I highly recommend Eden of the East.
2013-05-18 00:50:53	kini	completely different from the series, you mean, right? hopefully not completely different from each other
2013-05-18 00:51:18	bkero	Right, the movies diverge from the series halfway through #2
2013-05-18 00:51:26	kini	oh well, whatever
2013-05-18 00:51:26	kini	so anno feels like retconning, I don't mind - I watched the series many a year ago
2013-05-18 00:52:24	bkero	The entire series is hewbrew biblical bonghits anyways. A retcon is the least of the continuity and rationality problems.
2013-05-18 00:52:28	kini	eden of the east, I remember that airing (didn't watch it though)
2013-05-18 00:52:34	kini	lol ya
2013-05-18 00:52:45	bkero	Seriously, I've seen a lot of shitty anime bu EotE is at least #3 or 4.
2013-05-18 00:53:01	bkero	Lain, Eva, Summer Wars, Cowboy Bebop, EotE
2013-05-18 00:53:01	kini	it aired in noitamina, that's a good sign
2013-05-18 00:53:16	bkero	The series is only 11 eps, but the 2 movies are essential
2013-05-18 00:53:29	bkero	At one point the protaganist becomes kind of Japan
2013-05-18 00:53:39	bkero	(the movie is set in 2009)
2013-05-18 00:53:43	bkero	*king
2013-05-18 00:54:02	kini	haha I was wondering for a second how 厨二病 this could possibly be that the protagonist "becomes kind of Japan"
2013-05-18 00:54:26	bkero	Sorry, KING. King of Japan.
2013-05-18 00:58:31	kini	I'm slowly watching seikai no senki these days, then I'll rewatch mugen no ryvius - maybe I'll watch it after those
2013-05-18 00:58:52	kini	(on a hattori katsuhisa kick I guess)
2013-05-18 00:59:57	Kona	Oh, is the anime of sekai no senki any good? I think I may have read the manga, but it didn't make much of an impression on me.
2013-05-18 00:59:59	bkero	kini: I'd really recommend Ginga eiyu Densetsu or Samurai Champloo
2013-05-18 01:00:32	kini	Kona: meh so far - I did enjoy seikai no monsyou though
2013-05-18 01:00:37	kini	I'm only 4 episodes in, though
2013-05-18 01:00:53	kini	bkero: seen champloo, ginga eiyuu densetu looks kind of long to commit
2013-05-18 01:01:14	Kona	The Samurai Seven anime is worth a watch, if you haven't seen it
2013-05-18 01:01:22	kini	(ps RIP nujabes++)
2013-05-18 01:01:33	kini	I have not
2013-05-18 01:01:39	bkero	It's a long commitment, but it's quite highly rated and reviewed
2013-05-18 01:02:15	bkero	kini: if I wanted to tell you something that was fantasitc but long to commit I would recommend Galaxy Express 999
2013-05-18 01:02:31	kini	longest anime I've watched is monster, which was well worth it
2013-05-18 01:03:43	bkero	http://i.imgur.com/vAo7lb5.jpg
2013-05-18 01:03:43	kini	oh, I've heard of that I think
2013-05-18 01:03:47	kini	that's seriously ancient haha
2013-05-18 01:05:27	bkero	But fantastic
2013-05-18 01:05:37	bkero	Caught the first movie on SciFi anime late at night
2013-05-18 01:05:46	bkero	Then went back to pick up the naime and manga
2013-05-18 01:05:54	bkero	Leiji Matsumoto is one of anime's legendary directors.
2013-05-18 01:06:33	bkero	He also did Ozuma from last season
2013-05-18 01:07:12	bkero	Okay, I need to stop nerding and -> bed
2013-05-18 01:07:24	bkero	No ice cream star for me, but consoluation prize grea morning!
2013-05-18 01:07:39	kini	haha wow I didn't realize he supervised the daft punk movie
2013-05-18 01:08:07	bkero	He also did Space Battleship Yamato
2013-05-18 01:08:31	bkero	and Captain harlock :)
2013-05-18 01:08:56	kini	yeah those are what I knew him for (and galaxy express 999)
2013-05-18 01:09:07	kini	haven't watched any of them but they're famous
2013-05-18 01:09:50	bkero	They're more worth your time than something like Oreimo or Madoka Magicka
2013-05-18 01:11:39	kini	madoka is supposedly pretty worthwhile (though I haven't watched it, only saw the first couple movies when they were playing downtown in december)
2013-05-18 01:11:39	kini	oreimo is almost certainly worthless and I have no intention of watching it lol
2013-05-18 01:11:54	bkero	Good good
2013-05-18 01:12:10	bkero	kini: welcome to the nhk is also very good
2013-05-18 01:12:13	Kona	That reminds me. bkero, you could do a screening of Milky Sherlock
2013-05-18 01:12:26	bkero	Also anything hinichiro watanabe, but then again you already knew that (especially michiko to hatchin)
2013-05-18 01:12:40	bkero	Kona: You still owe me fan art of milky holmes
2013-05-18 01:12:41	kini	I saw welcome to the nhk back when it came out
2013-05-18 01:12:49	kini	it didn't strike me as particularly amazing, though it wasn't bad
2013-05-18 01:13:33	bkero	Anime is a sea of mediocrity
2013-05-18 01:13:37	Kona	bkero, I don't think I can produce "fan" art
2013-05-18 01:13:51	Kona	for that
2013-05-18 01:13:53	bkero	Sutrgeon's Law must be taken 3 or 4 times to the topic of anime.
2013-05-18 01:14:06	bkero	One run of Sturgeon's law is simply not enough to separate the wheat from the chaff.
2013-05-18 01:14:17	bkero	Kona: You promised. :|
2013-05-18 01:14:38	Kona	I believe I promised art of the original detectives in magical girl uniform
2013-05-18 01:14:45	Kona	which is quite a different matter.
2013-05-18 01:14:46	kini	I don't watch much anime anymore, just if a friend recommends it or if I find it particularly interesting for some reason
2013-05-18 01:14:49	 *	bkero had a happy evening, and happy evenings must be accompanied by satisfactory slumber. I'm currently reducing my amount of satisfactory slumber.
2013-05-18 01:15:08	Kona	night
2013-05-18 01:15:12	bkero	Kona: you promiesd them all in male form in my chambers
2013-05-18 01:15:13	kini	night bkero
2013-05-18 01:15:33	 *	bkero -> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
2013-05-18 01:15:53	Kona	kini, watch mostly subbed, I take it?
2013-05-18 01:16:14	kini	I've been trying to avoid subs since 2010
2013-05-18 01:16:39	Kona	In favor of dubs?
2013-05-18 01:16:42	kini	oh
2013-05-18 01:16:44	kini	no in favor of raws
2013-05-18 01:16:50	Kona	Ah, impressive.
2013-05-18 01:16:59	kini	not really, I don't succeed very well at watching raws haha
2013-05-18 01:17:04	Kona	Heh
2013-05-18 01:17:05	kini	I try though
2013-05-18 01:17:09	Kona	Yeah, still
2013-05-18 01:17:43	kini	usually I go back and re-listen to words or phrases I didn't catch or didn't know
2013-05-18 01:17:43	 *	Kona remembers trying to watch Howl's Moving Castle in French... difficult even *with* subs, if you're trying to focus on the audio.
2013-05-18 01:18:36	kini	once I tried watching a whole show raw without rewinding - it went OK I guess, I managed to follow the plot more or less but I definitely missed a lot of the details (tetuwan birdy decode 2)
2013-05-18 01:19:10	kini	I don't think I know anyone who prefers dubs over subs
2013-05-18 01:19:27	kini	for one thing there are so few dubbed series
2013-05-18 01:19:48	kini	and their usual quality is notoriously bad
2013-05-18 01:19:55	Kona	True
2013-05-18 01:20:12	Kona	I'm a bit of a multitasker, so I like dubs
2013-05-18 01:20:27	Kona	but I understand the dislike of them, and I don't watch as much anime as I used to, anyway.
2013-05-18 01:21:06	kini	yeah I don't either - for some reason
2013-05-18 01:21:20	kini	I would say I have less free time than I used but I'm not sure if that's actually true
2013-05-18 01:21:27	kini	seems like I just spend it differently
2013-05-18 01:22:20	Kona	Like bkero said, so much of anime is so terrible
2013-05-18 01:22:49	Kona	Especially once I started critically examining the stuff I was watching, I was pretty disappointed.
2013-05-18 01:23:25	Kona	So yeah, mostly just watch if I'm specifically recommended something or think it might be particularly interesting.
2013-05-18 01:24:42	kini	several of my old friends who used to watch a lot of anime back when I did too have also stopped watching as much these days
2013-05-18 01:24:42	kini	but many of them have sort of migrated to visual novels and are encouraging me to follow them
2013-05-18 01:24:59	kini	doesn't sound like such a bad idea, really - it would be good reading practice at least
2013-05-18 01:25:06	kini	though I'm sure there's a sea of crap in visual novel world too
2013-05-18 01:25:17	kini	possibly more so than in anime considering the lower barrier to entry into the market
2013-05-18 01:25:49	Kona	Mm
2013-05-18 01:25:51	kini	but there's only so much vocabulary and sentence patterns you can pick up from IRC and websites
2013-05-18 01:26:11	Kona	And probably considering the level of difficulty you would be able to handle as someone learning.
2013-05-18 01:26:33	Kona	I still read kind of a lot of manga, though more in concentrated bursts
2013-05-18 01:26:37	Kona	(in English)
2013-05-18 01:28:00	kini	several of my friends who started reading visual novels a couple years ago have way surpassed my japanese ability by now
2013-05-18 01:28:05	kini	I don't doubt it's a good learning aid
2013-05-18 01:29:37	Kona	Yeah, definitely.
2013-05-18 01:30:06	Kona	My roommate is doing a thesis on how activities like writing fan fiction aid in language learning
2013-05-18 01:30:10	Kona	You could try that ;)
2013-05-18 01:30:12	kini	rofl
2013-05-18 01:30:15	kini	nothx
2013-05-18 01:30:18	Kona	Haha
2013-05-18 01:30:39	Kona	Writing of any sort is also really good practice, though feedback is needed
2013-05-18 01:30:54	kini	I practice my japanese on IRC with japanese people pretty frequently
2013-05-18 01:31:05	Kona	Nice!
2013-05-18 01:31:11	kini	but that's really just conversational level, not literary level
2013-05-18 01:31:15	kini	which is the real challenge
2013-05-18 01:31:41	Kona	Don't forget to handwrite, too. It's easy to forget how to write characters even when you can recognize and read them.
2013-05-18 01:31:55	kini	I've never even tried to learn Japanese handwriting
2013-05-18 01:32:03	kini	I discarded it as a goal from the beginning
2013-05-18 01:32:28	Kona	When I took Chinese, we were expressly forbidden from learning to type the characters. Apparently it's a big problem with young people.
2013-05-18 01:32:33	kini	for the same reason I don't memorize exact kanji compositions, radicals, strokes, etc. - as long as I can recognize them that's good enough for me
2013-05-18 01:32:43	Kona	Heh
2013-05-18 01:32:54	Kona	Long as you know what you want.
2013-05-18 01:33:36	kini	yeah, in Japanese it's called ワープロ馬鹿
2013-05-18 01:33:39	kini	word processor idiot
2013-05-18 01:34:11	kini	I guess it is a widespread "problem" with young people, but I don't really see it as a problem
2013-05-18 01:34:18	kini	hell, I rarely if ever handwrite anything in English
2013-05-18 01:34:25	Kona	Heh.
2013-05-18 01:34:37	Kona	A lot of people I know through CS are like that.
2013-05-18 01:34:51	kini	today I was writing a birthday card and realized I hadn't actually written words on paper for like a month or more
2013-05-18 01:35:15	Kona	I'm the type of person who needs to physically write stuff to remember it
2013-05-18 01:35:27	kini	have you tried SRS?
2013-05-18 01:35:48	Kona	SRS?
2013-05-18 01:36:04	kini	spaced repetition software
2013-05-18 01:36:27	kini	for example: http://ankisrs.net/
2013-05-18 01:36:35	Kona	Oh, is that the memory thing?
2013-05-18 01:36:46	kini	yeah
2013-05-18 01:37:12	kini	it can take some work to formulate what you want to remember into flashcards but it's worth it
2013-05-18 01:37:14	Kona	I haven't actually tried it, but Hunner has mentioned it before
2013-05-18 01:37:29	Kona	Not just learning stuff, though
2013-05-18 01:38:02	Kona	Things like story ideas, to do lists, etc
2013-05-18 01:38:19	kini	well, learning is on some level the same as remembering things
2013-05-18 01:38:19	kini	the "on some level" is where the "it can take some work" comes in
2013-05-18 01:38:42	kini	in theory the spaced repetition system should work the same for memorizing flashcards and for just reinforcing any kind of learning
2013-05-18 01:38:59	kini	by making you think about whatever concept you want to learn at the spaced intervals
2013-05-18 01:39:28	kini	if you want to use flashcard software like anki to manage it then you need to formulate that into flashcards, which can be limiting, but the basic principle remains sound
2013-05-18 01:39:52	Kona	Yeah, sure. I'd definitely try it at some point.
2013-05-18 01:43:15	kini	here's a referenced literature review about spaced repetition http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition
2013-05-18 01:43:39	Kona	Nice, thanks!
2013-05-18 01:43:48	Kona	It'll have to wait til later for me, though.

2013-05-18 01:44:46	Kona	Probably shouldn't be chatting too much, but it's helping me stay awake

2013-05-18 14:10:31	pilgrimd	It's pretty telling that, essentially, it's impossible for RF to do any damage unless you have a habit of snuggling with magnetrons and other kilowatt-or-higher transmitters.

2013-05-18 14:32:19	pilgrimd	bajr: No, baconium converts directly to happiness without intermediate chemical phases.
2013-05-18 14:32:19	bajr	happiness could also be serotonin
2013-05-18 14:33:17	bajr	ah, so baconium is known to attach itself to receptors normally associated with dopamine, I see
2013-05-18 14:34:05	pilgrimd	bajr: Yes, but unlike dopamine, the body has no baconium-reuptake process, so you get permanent happiness.
2013-05-18 14:35:53	retrov	baconium doesn't cross the blood brain barrier either
2013-05-18 14:35:54	bkero	bacon binds to all the cannabinoid receptors
2013-05-18 14:35:58	retrov	though, neither does dopamine
2013-05-18 14:36:16	bajr	hmm, not sure that's true, the state of happiness could be longer, but I believe it's because the baconium refuses to detach itself from the receptor, leading to the necrotization of the neuron involved

2013-05-19 01:19:27	kini	they delayed it for several months and then when they finally aired it the climactic battle ended in a weird cliffhanger disaster, and then the second season started with a timeskip totally ignoring the cliffhanger and leaving explanation of its resolution to backstory exposition
2013-05-19 01:19:36	kini	bravo lol
2013-05-19 01:20:53	@kennobaka	Like I said, watch until just before the last episode, swallow the blue pill, and believe whatever you want to believe.
2013-05-19 01:21:20	@kennobaka	R2 did have its moments, but far too few of them
2013-05-19 01:21:42	@kennobaka	And there are more efficient ways to get fanservice; that seemed to be its main point.
2013-05-19 01:22:26	bkero	I watched s1 of code geass. I could only take one Pizza Hut episode before I decided to pack it in.
2013-05-19 01:46:45	kini	apparently the executive meddling started several episodes before the end of s1

2013-05-20 21:07:59	retrov	this sucks
2013-05-20 21:08:22	MaddHatter	this discussion has been happening in several channels lately
2013-05-20 21:09:01	MaddHatter	I've heard not-such-good things about centurylink, and comcast has always worked great for me, even if they're a little expensive. But I think there are horror stories from every ISP.
2013-05-20 21:09:40	retrov	someone here a few days ago mentioned something they did with their DNS
2013-05-20 21:09:56	MaddHatter	Every ISP I know does that. Comcast does at least let you opt out.
2013-05-20 21:10:09	MaddHatter	it's *really* annoying
2013-05-20 21:11:30	MaddHatter	the whole notion that the only reason to look up a domain name is to subsequently talk at it on port 80 is so short-sighted.
2013-05-20 21:13:31	david	kini: this is awesome: http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/05/bounded_gaps_between_primes.html

2013-05-20 21:14:27	retrov	i'd save on modem rental costs after 9 months
2013-05-20 21:14:28	clarkb	david: thats there thing where there are infinite numbers of primes with gaps between them of up to 70million?
2013-05-20 21:14:39	clarkb	wow cannot type
2013-05-20 21:15:02	david	yup
2013-05-20 21:15:50	MaddHatter	basically that the twin prime conjecture is false, iiuc
2013-05-20 21:17:08	david	no
2013-05-20 21:17:23	clarkb	I think its pushing more towards pushing it because 2 < 70 million
2013-05-20 21:17:34	clarkb	wow I really cannot type. two fails in a row
2013-05-20 21:22:23	david	this proof says that no matter how big numbers get, you can find two primes that are only 70 million apart
2013-05-20 21:23:13	clarkb	and they hope to keep making that number smaller
2013-05-20 21:23:40	david	right
2013-05-20 21:23:51	MaddHatter	hm. I think the article I heard must have been wrong. (Or I misheard it.)
2013-05-20 21:24:01	clarkb	so 2 is a long ways off, but they are pushing that direction

2013-05-21 11:31:15	Wren	I got a technical phone interview with Puppet in two hours. Any tips?

2013-05-21 11:32:39	MaddHatter	I don't have anything specific to puppet, but any good technical screen will push you beyond what you know. At that point, just start thinking out loud and progress as far as you can.
2013-05-21 11:32:50	Wren	Sales engineering intern. Doing Web devopment stuff.

2013-05-21 11:32:58	Ac-town	MaddHatter has a good point
2013-05-21 11:33:04	Ac-town	just relax and think outloud
2013-05-21 11:33:17	Ac-town	even if you don't know explain how you would figure it out
2013-05-21 11:33:23	Ac-town	or how you would at least try
2013-05-21 11:33:38	Wren	The only part of the job requirements that I'm not too good with is "Familiarity with web APIs using JavaScript"
2013-05-21 11:33:42	Kraytul	finch: come coach Wren
2013-05-21 11:34:03	@krinkle	Wren++ good luck
2013-05-21 11:34:04	Ac-town	sounds like buzz words
2013-05-21 11:34:31	MaddHatter	"web apis using javascript" sounds to me like xmlhttprequest and websockets
2013-05-21 11:34:35	Wren	I suppose I technically did a small amount of jquery with morbid
2013-05-21 11:34:50	Corbin	> JavaScript
2013-05-21 11:35:40	finch	coaching on trolling?
2013-05-21 11:35:40	MaddHatter	but yeah, maybe they mean more what frameworks are available and how you can glue together framework 1 + framework 2 to build mousetrap Y in 1 day.
2013-05-21 11:35:43	finch	or working at puppet?
2013-05-21 11:35:43	Wren	I also a callback from the Tigard guys. But id rather for someone closer...
2013-05-21 11:36:13	Wren	finch: Coaching on getting accepted to work at puppet :)
2013-05-21 11:37:00	finch	Wren: how's your ruby and debugging?
2013-05-21 11:37:11	finch	erm, proficiency with debugging things?
2013-05-21 11:37:51	Wren	non existant, though the job only listed that as "bonus points"
2013-05-21 11:38:26	finch	what sort of javascript have you done?
2013-05-21 11:39:47	Wren	a little bit of jquery in a braindump with morbid >_<
2013-05-21 11:41:03	finch	and what kind of position is this?

2013-05-21 11:41:24	finch	what are they asking for?
2013-05-21 11:41:39	eidolon	if they're asking for javascript I'm assuming they have a project in mind
2013-05-21 11:42:05	@krinkle	Wren: elemental hired me for webdev even after I straight up told them I don't know js
2013-05-21 11:42:22	@krinkle	you're probably fine

2013-05-21 11:43:25	Wren	Don't know how many people are applying for the job.
2013-05-21 11:44:19	eidolon	even if you don't get it Puppet interviews are a pretty good experience
2013-05-21 11:44:51	eidolon	I had a couple rounds that I did not do great in but they always taught me a lot about what I *didn't* know and what to look into to improve my skillset and fill in holes
2013-05-21 11:45:44	MaddHatter	I wish _I_ could get an interview :-( Nobody wants EEs though.
2013-05-21 11:46:43	retrov	Wren: ask business-y questions
2013-05-21 11:46:55	retrov	it's likely what sealed the deal for my interview at my current company
2013-05-21 11:47:00	Wren	like what?
2013-05-21 11:47:13	retrov	i asked what their customer base was like
2013-05-21 11:47:20	retrov	bigger compnaies, smalelr comapnies, etc.
2013-05-21 11:47:36	retrov	what the mix was between big and small, were they beholden to 1 or 2 really large customers, things like that
2013-05-21 11:47:39	@cbeck	"How do you go about your decisioning"
2013-05-21 11:48:11	Wren	retrov: where do you work?

2013-05-21 11:53:11	Wren	Hmm, what kind of questions to ask of puppet?
2013-05-21 11:53:47	bkero	"What would my daily tasks be like?" "What sort of work do you plan on giving me?" "How is communication usually done?" "How many meetings per week will I be part of?"
2013-05-21 11:55:08	Wren	Compensation?
2013-05-21 11:56:51	bkero	That would also be good

2013-05-21 14:01:45	Wren	Yes, that is much money
2013-05-21 14:03:00	bkero	If you're used to working 20hrs/week as a student, it's about quadrouple the pay.
2013-05-21 14:05:55	clarkb1	the best part of intern pay as a student is you get all of the education tax breaks so its like working tax free almost
2013-05-21 14:06:52	retrov	clarkb1: are you referring to the 1098T or are there other tax breaks as well?
2013-05-21 14:08:04	clarkb1	retrov: there is another one that you can take up to 3 years I think
2013-05-21 14:08:24	clarkb1	where its like a tax credit. they basically drop your taxable income by some huge amount because you are a student
2013-05-21 14:08:36	clarkb1	irregardless of tuition paid
2013-05-21 14:09:22	kini	irregardless?
2013-05-21 14:11:49	retrov	clarkb1: are you sure it isn't mutually exclusive with hte American Opportunity credit (the one you need the 1098T form for)?

2013-05-21 15:10:59	+alevar	I'm not sure if I even want to have that in the web app. :/
2013-05-21 15:11:35	+alevar	It's just for automatic population of some tables, but any access is a chink in PSU's security.
2013-05-21 15:14:40	+alevar	Would it probably still be the same answer, even with some extreme limits?
2013-05-21 15:15:01	Kraytul	yeah, almost surely
2013-05-21 15:16:50	+alevar	Er... I should give a little bit more detail. This is going through a guy who is working with the math department on a study group organization web app. So not just a few random students.

2013-05-21 15:23:37	tamgc	alevar: have them request the access for you
2013-05-21 15:23:45	tamgc	but chances are, they'd still probably say no
2013-05-21 15:24:10	tamgc	FERPA and all that...and they'd prob question the math dept people one their need of access
2013-05-21 15:24:20	+alevar	He's doing most of the communication. I'm just giving a list of "hey, this would be nice!".
2013-05-21 15:24:32	Wren	...I just got a call from '719' which consisted of just a bunch of beeping.

2013-05-21 15:37:04	bkero	Corbin: figured it out. django.http.request doesn't exist in 1.4
2013-05-21 15:38:29	Corbin	bkero: Ah. Yes, Django is lame.
2013-05-21 15:38:45	bkero	Corbin: look at the setup instructions on this trainwreck. https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur

2013-05-21 15:41:02	Wren	Can't even call them back.
2013-05-21 15:41:21	Corbin	> You will want to download MongoDB.
2013-05-21 15:41:25	Kraytul	puppet trolling you?
2013-05-21 15:41:27	Corbin	No, Svengali, I really don't.
2013-05-21 15:44:29	bkero	Corbin: I need to falsify a requirements.txt, what is the minimum I can put in that file to return nonzero with easy_install < requirements.txt?
2013-05-21 15:44:40	bkero	This project has an empty one, and that returns nonzero :/
2013-05-21 15:53:13	Corbin	bkero: Really? That's kind of weird.
2013-05-21 15:53:30	Corbin	Anyway, you could just put "Django" in there.
2013-05-21 15:55:27	bkero	Yeah, that's what I ended up doing
2013-05-21 15:55:38	bkero	Corbin: easy_install doesn't take a requirements.txt though, echoing it into stdin doesn't work
2013-05-21 15:57:43	Corbin	bkero: easy_install is horrid; use pip?
2013-05-21 15:57:54	bkero	Corbin: Yeah, I've been patching the fabfile
2013-05-21 15:58:00	bkero	I kind of hate fabric
2013-05-21 15:58:33	bkero	It doesn't keep track of what setup components are done, so each task starts at the beginning each time
2013-05-21 15:59:22	Corbin	Yeah.
2013-05-21 15:59:34	bkero	Network monitor is really slick: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-developer-tool-features-for-firefox-23/
2013-05-21 16:00:52	bkero	For http://www.idealist.org, 615ms for idealist.js (holy shit that thing is half a meg), 986ms for some random 8kb jpeg, 1003ms for cc.png, etc
2013-05-21 16:01:25	Corbin	Nice.
2013-05-21 16:01:46	bkero	half a meg gzipped D:
2013-05-21 16:05:26	kini	I've noticed a lot of developer tools have been sneaking into firefox in the last few versions
2013-05-21 16:05:51	bkero	They're pretty sweet
2013-05-21 16:05:53	kini	I'm no web developer but I have been using firebug for whatever little inspection stuff I need to do from time to time since waaaay back
2013-05-21 16:06:02	greghaynes	bkero: neat website, what is that?
2013-05-21 16:06:05	greghaynes	:p
2013-05-21 16:06:13	kini	and from the press releases it seems like a lot of the things mozilla is adding to firefox are basically duplicates of features that firebug has had for a long time
2013-05-21 16:06:15	kini	is that a misunderstanding?
2013-05-21 16:06:16	greghaynes	also, yes, why the hell do we have half a meg of js
2013-05-21 16:06:25	bkero	greghaynes: That's gzipped half a meg too
2013-05-21 16:07:23	bkero	It's not even minified, it's just a bunch of javascript libraries. It looks like you're including jquery twice.
2013-05-21 16:07:38	Kraytul	haha
2013-05-21 16:08:18	@cbeck	bkero: Heh, the author of fabric was just grousing at me to use it
2013-05-21 16:08:20	bkero	Ah, the source is minified, but the gigantic comments are not
2013-05-21 16:08:32	greghaynes	lol
2013-05-21 16:09:49	greghaynes	bkero: any idea why that 8k image took a second?
2013-05-21 16:09:51	greghaynes	thats odd
2013-05-21 16:10:15	bkero	greghaynes: No idea. You can get ff 23a2 and load up the network profiler and try for yourself
2013-05-21 16:10:23	greghaynes	heh
2013-05-21 16:10:26	bkero	Maybe it wasn't cached
2013-05-21 16:10:31	greghaynes	still
2013-05-21 16:10:35	greghaynes	shouldnt be anywhere close to taht

2013-05-21 16:30:32	clarkb	greghaynes: obviously you need to shrink your firefox windows to a quarter of your screen
2013-05-21 16:30:38	clarkb	and use a magnifying glass
2013-05-21 16:30:41	greghaynes	heh
2013-05-21 16:30:48	greghaynes	I mean it looks fine on its own nowdays
2013-05-21 16:31:00	greghaynes	but if you want to open up some kind of context menu
2013-05-21 16:31:01	greghaynes	GG
2013-05-21 16:31:05	bkero	greghaynes: You mean Apple didn't use their brilliant "pixel doubler" on OS X too?
2013-05-21 16:32:08	greghaynes	Its a side effect of some pixel doubler? I get this all the time http://i.imgur.com/qUawsYx.png
2013-05-21 16:32:23	greghaynes	kind of the inverse retina problem

2013-05-21 16:48:45	MaddHatter	the dev tools was one of the biggest reasons people bitched about switching to webkit, because they had some really awesome dev tools and rumor is they're basically all being thrown away because they're (obviously) tightly integrated into the core.

2013-05-23 11:34:20	clarkb	this doesn't help in the recruiter arena or when resumes are automagically processed, but I like to think we can downplay specific tool/technology experience. hire a smart person and they figure it out

2013-05-23 11:35:51	clarkb	this doesn't apply where significant level of specific domain knowledge are necessary for a job, but I think those positions are rare and probably exist in more researchy type spaces. but again I don't hire many people so I am probably wrong

2013-05-26 01:44:10	Corbin	...And admittedly some of those things are cultural, like how the Eastside can have all of these geeks working for Amazon, Google, MS, NoA, etc. and yet they have no late-night food.
2013-05-26 01:44:43	Corbin	I might just make a hike up the hill to 7-Eleven, which is a thing.
2013-05-26 01:49:20	mythmon	when you said east side, at first I thought you meant a store called Eastside, because in $hometown, we had one of those.
2013-05-26 01:49:58	Corbin	Oh, cool.
2013-05-26 01:50:14	mythmon	also, you are making me hungry. which is a problem because im already on bed.

2013-05-27 18:49:20	kini	wat
2013-05-27 18:49:30	aleph	yep
2013-05-27 18:50:01	kini	what happened after that
2013-05-27 18:50:38	aleph	Nothing. Class continued. Said he was the worst teacher he'd ever had and should find other line of work.
2013-05-27 18:51:10	Kraytul	Wow...
2013-05-27 18:51:19	aleph	yeah...
2013-05-27 18:51:30	Kraytul	see, Tolmach is amazing at compilers in his own right, I have no Li to compare to eveb,
2013-05-27 18:51:34	Kraytul	even*
2013-05-27 18:51:48	Kraytul	I've heard bad things, but I can only testify as to Tolmach awesome against baseline
2013-05-27 18:52:32	aleph	IIRC, cbeck liked Tolmach's compiler class. And we had Tolmach as guest lecture at end and it was good.
2013-05-27 18:55:00	aleph	I think Li's biggest problem is Compilers takes a lot of low level detail work *as well* as high level concepts. Li seems to mostly do the low level stuff by rote (and old files) and it's gradually gotten away from him.

2013-05-28 11:36:54	bkero	It's very short, only about 90 minutes.
2013-05-28 11:36:57	bkero	It's more of a short story

2013-05-28 11:39:43	tamgc	hotline miami, thomas was alone, and awesomnauts I've heard good things about in general
2013-05-28 11:40:41	clarkb	I am a fan of games like that. Heavy rain was awesome and I would've played it a lot more if it wasn't so buggy
2013-05-28 11:41:00	clarkb	where games like that == story driven interactive "video games"
2013-05-28 11:41:00	mythmon	awesomnauts is basically a moba side scroller.
2013-05-28 11:41:08	mythmon	Pretty fun.
2013-05-28 11:41:18	mythmon	Playable with an xbox controller.

2013-05-28 14:03:54	bkero	mythmon: I need you to look at a piece of python code and not have you claw your eyes out
2013-05-28 14:04:19	bkero	This thing is ridiculously slow at generating any output when people are accessing the sqlite database it uses. https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/pushlog/file/d445a97d837d/pushlog-feed.py
2013-05-28 14:04:33	mythmon	bkero: you know that sqlite is single threaded, right?

2013-05-28 14:05:09	david	Kraytul: try using http://www.coasttocoastresearch.com/apg/docs/doc63 or http://www.parse2.com/ on that grammar
2013-05-28 14:05:10	bkero	mythmon: the database is 19mb
2013-05-28 14:05:34	mythmon	my first idea is that it is spinning around trying to read a sqlite database that is locked.
2013-05-28 14:06:03	bkero	How can I tell if it's locked?
2013-05-28 14:06:13	bkero	just if another proc has it open?
2013-05-28 14:06:19	mythmon	i think so.
2013-05-28 14:06:26	mythmon	you said "when other people are accessing the sqlite database"
2013-05-28 14:06:36	mythmon	if someone is actively accessing it, you can't also access, you wait until they are done.
2013-05-28 14:06:39	 *	mythmon reads the code.
2013-05-28 14:06:45	clarkb	you can have multiple sqlite processes reading the same DB
2013-05-28 14:06:54	clarkb	I think it locks around UPDATEs though
2013-05-28 14:07:01	mythmon	hmm. maybe.
2013-05-28 14:07:14	mythmon	but still, concurrent users > 1 && sqlite === :(
2013-05-28 14:07:19	clarkb	I am 99% sure as I run the command line client against a DB that scripts talk to all the time
2013-05-28 14:08:41	Corbin	It certainly does "lock".
2013-05-28 14:08:47	Corbin	Don't try concurrent writers on Windows.
2013-05-28 14:09:33	mythmon	bkero: I'm not sure how to parse this. where does execution start?
2013-05-28 14:09:50	bkero	clarkb: readlock on open()?
2013-05-28 14:10:04	clarkb	yeah you can't do concurrent writes
2013-05-28 14:13:37	mythmon	bkero: so that I understand, if people stop touching the sqlite, this gets fast? or it is still slow?
2013-05-28 14:17:39	bkero	mythmon: if there are commits that take a long time, reading from the web interface (which reads from the sqlite file) will sometimes just freeze
2013-05-28 14:18:53	mythmon	bkero: I'm not even sure what the code is supposed to do.
2013-05-28 14:19:06	bkero	mythmon: http://hg.mozilla.org/try/pushlog
2013-05-28 14:19:43	mythmon	bkero: it generates that?
2013-05-28 14:19:54	bkero	yes
2013-05-28 14:20:13	bkero	and a list of stuff (beyond the word 'summary') on http://hg.mozilla.org/try
2013-05-28 14:21:39	mythmon	bkero: profile it?
2013-05-28 14:22:03	bkero	mythmon: It's being run by apache/mod_wsgi, so it's more difficult :/
2013-05-28 14:22:07	mythmon	I don't really have the gumption to digest 400 lines of code that works with libraries I haven't used.
2013-05-28 14:22:35	mythmon	I think you can insert something into the file to profile it, but I'm not sure.
2013-05-28 14:22:45	bkero	Yeah :/ I'm going to hand it off to the mercurial developers to see if they can find some horrific API calls that shouldn't be used.
2013-05-28 14:23:14	Corbin	I still like how y'all had to hire hg devs in order to do hg.
2013-05-28 14:23:18	Corbin	Because it's just *that* bad.
2013-05-28 14:24:16	mythmon	I've heard that mozilla-central might be switching to github.
2013-05-28 14:24:27	bkero	Corbin: We haven't hired any hg devs. I'm the closest one they have to paying someone to dev hg.
2013-05-28 14:24:53	bkero	mythmon: I had a meeting about that a month or two ago. Not likely to happen.
2013-05-28 14:25:18	mythmon	bkero: ah, I heard a rumor.
2013-05-28 14:25:25	mythmon	but it was brief and unsupported.
2013-05-28 14:26:04	bkero	I had a meeting, don't remember with who, but someone sufficiently higher up. Github doesn't give us a lot of the flexibility we need.
2013-05-28 14:26:13	bkero	I wouldn't mind if I could go do something else though.
2013-05-28 14:26:17	mythmon	makes sense.
2013-05-28 14:26:28	mythmon	or maybe it was that they are just going to switch to git. I forget.
2013-05-28 14:26:33	Corbin	bkero: Oh. I had thought that Moz had gotten some of the hg devs hired. Guess not.
2013-05-28 14:26:34	clarkb	gerrit is reasonably flexible if the actual review submission style works
2013-05-28 14:26:38	mythmon	either way, I'm glad I don't deal with moz central.
2013-05-28 14:26:56	mythmon	clarkb: code review happens in bugzilla right now.
2013-05-28 14:27:18	bkero	Corbin: facebook's been having some problems scaling git, so they've been switching over to Mercurial, they have about five full timers dedicated to developing hg.
2013-05-28 14:27:32	clarkb	bkero: what kind of scaling problems?
2013-05-28 14:27:35	clarkb	mythmon: ouch
2013-05-28 14:27:45	bkero	clarkb: cloning speed and the on-wire format iirc
2013-05-28 14:27:52	mythmon	clarkb: from what I have perceived, not that bad actually.
2013-05-28 14:27:56	bkero	You're welcome to ask them in #mercurial
2013-05-28 14:28:10	bkero	Corbin: Bryan O'Sullivan is one of the guys I know at facebook who works full-time on Mercurial.
2013-05-28 14:28:17	clarkb	I would be afraid of starting a flame war. Mostly just curious
2013-05-28 14:30:41	bkero	clarkb: I do like the concept of changesets and queues in mercurial, wonder if there are equivalents in git.
2013-05-28 14:30:51	bkero	!s/sets/groups/g
2013-05-28 14:31:39	Corbin	bkero: They put bos on hg? Wow.
2013-05-28 14:31:43	 *	Corbin knows bos from Haskell
2013-05-28 14:32:21	bkero	Corbin: He's been there for > 2 years
2013-05-28 14:33:02	Corbin	bkero: Hm. I had thought that he was doing Haskell research, but I guess not.
2013-05-28 14:34:37	clarkb	bkero: googling hg change groups doesn't return anything
2013-05-28 14:34:44	clarkb	it does talk about changesets though
2013-05-28 14:35:09	clarkb	a changeset seems to be equivalent to a git commit
2013-05-28 14:35:32	bkero	a changeset is a git commit, a changegroup is a group of changesets
2013-05-28 14:36:02	clarkb	like a branch?
2013-05-28 14:36:24	bkero	A branch merge would be an example of merging a set of changes
2013-05-28 14:37:16	bkero	For things like post-commit hooks though, mercurial can execute hooks after a group of changesets are committed
2013-05-28 14:37:25	bkero	instead of having to flatten it
2013-05-28 14:38:32	clarkb	I see. I don't think git has an equivalent.
2013-05-28 14:39:25	Corbin	This is because git allows you to modify history.
2013-05-28 14:39:38	Corbin	hg doesn't like it, as a rule. Its authors do *not* like any kind of private history rewriting.
2013-05-28 14:40:00	Corbin	So they've invented various ways to allow you to simulate "committing" without actually committing, and such.
2013-05-28 14:40:30	clarkb	that seems to be what the queues are used for
2013-05-28 14:41:07	bkero	Corbin: It's mercurial's on-disk format. It uses append-only logs as opposed to git's blob objects
2013-05-28 14:42:27	Corbin	bkero: Right, because altering history is bad.
2013-05-28 14:42:43	Corbin	I don't agree with this *at all* for a distributed VCS, but hg is free to do hg things.
2013-05-28 14:43:11	 *	bkero just said he liked the concept of changegroups
2013-05-28 14:43:36	Corbin	I know. You can keep your moderate opinions. I'll just be over here, being a bigot. :3
2013-05-28 14:43:56	bkero	lulz
2013-05-28 14:44:06	bkero	also having quilt integrated into your dvcs is pretty cool: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension
2013-05-28 14:45:01	Corbin	Yeah, mq is nifty.
2013-05-28 14:45:25	Corbin	I just wonder exactly how I'd be able to take somebody's cruddy Bravo patches and cherry-pick only every other one, if I were in hg.
2013-05-28 14:45:53	clarkb	so mq ~= darcs?

2013-05-28 14:48:12	bkero	hg pull --rebase
2013-05-28 14:48:21	clarkb	I used that and it got all cranky when I pusehd
2013-05-28 14:48:31	clarkb	something about new branches and things
2013-05-28 14:48:40	Corbin	I thought that rebase was the horror machine, only to be used as a last resort.
2013-05-28 14:49:00	 *	Corbin should point out that his only serious usage of hg for contribution was to PyPy, which is probably worst-case hg usage
2013-05-28 14:49:23	clarkb	Corbin: no, I think your questions are valid because I ran into similar issues with little tox
2013-05-28 14:49:57	Corbin	clarkb: PyPy did the worst's second-most-nightmarish SVN->hg move several years ago, and it's still a PITA to contribute because hg is very *very* confused about history.
2013-05-28 14:50:21	Corbin	Twisted takes the cake, though; it has branch names which are illegal according to pretty much every SVN client and server in existence.

2013-05-28 14:51:12	clarkb	by the way if anyone gets patches into tox I will buy you beer to help upstream my patch(es)
2013-05-28 14:51:57	bkero	.ini files? lulz
2013-05-28 14:52:38	clarkb	bkero: ?
2013-05-28 14:52:50	clarkb	python packaging is heading that direction
2013-05-28 14:52:51	bkero	clarkb: tox.ini
2013-05-28 14:52:59	clarkb	I don't get the lulz
2013-05-28 14:53:08	clarkb	its a simple format well supported by the platform
2013-05-28 14:53:14	bkero	I'm laughing at the file extension
2013-05-28 14:53:37	clarkb	in fact hg uses it iirc
2013-05-28 14:53:44	bkero	Python's built-in config parser uses something like an ini file
2013-05-28 14:53:58	clarkb	which is what tox is using
2013-05-28 14:54:19	bkero	They're not really INI files though
2013-05-28 14:54:22	bkero	They're just similar.
2013-05-28 14:54:40	bkero	Even python's docs say they're LIKE an INI file, but not the same.
2013-05-28 14:57:12	clarkb	if you don't already use tox for testing your python projects you should.
2013-05-28 14:57:40	clarkb	it mostly works great. There are a few corner cases we have tried fixing, but they aren't super receptive to patches. Or maybe I was just doing it wrong
2013-05-28 14:58:14	bkero	Looks like dependency testing instead of unit/mock testing
2013-05-28 14:58:35	clarkb	it doesn't care what the underlying tests do
2013-05-28 14:58:52	clarkb	but it constructs virtualenvs under various python versions so that it can run your tests
2013-05-28 14:59:08	bkero	as part of PWD or in a tempdir?
2013-05-28 14:59:27	clarkb	$PWD/.tox/ by default.
2013-05-28 14:59:36	clarkb	I think you can change that in tox.ini
2013-05-28 15:00:58	kini	lol mq
2013-05-28 15:01:13	kini	true monstrosities can arise from mq
2013-05-28 15:01:35	kini	bkero: you know how you can have a patch queue repo?
2013-05-28 15:01:55	bkero	kini: aye
2013-05-28 15:02:06	kini	(to counterbalance the fact that patch queues basically go completely against the concept of safe history since they're just a bunch of patch files and a series file)
2013-05-28 15:02:09	kini	well guess what
2013-05-28 15:02:17	kini	those patch queue repos are hg repos
2013-05-28 15:02:20	kini	and so they're distributed
2013-05-28 15:02:23	kini	and so you can share them!!
2013-05-28 15:02:27	bkero	kini: When they're in the patch queue they're not in the repo, so they're not part of history
2013-05-28 15:03:10	kini	and then you get... this! http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/
2013-05-28 15:03:41	bkero	kini: I think you're doing it wrong. D:
2013-05-28 15:03:50	kini	aw yeah now this is what I call a series file http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/series
2013-05-28 15:03:54	david	kini: aren't you guys moving to git?
2013-05-28 15:04:03	kini	david: yeah, but it hasn't happened yet
2013-05-28 15:04:10	bkero	kini: shouldn't you have just been using heads and transplanting?
2013-05-28 15:04:23	bkero	Instead of keeping horrific repos like that?
2013-05-28 15:04:30	kini	bkero: of course
2013-05-28 15:04:40	kini	I'm not saying this is the best hg can do
2013-05-28 15:04:47	kini	it's just one way in which it is being used in the wild lol
2013-05-28 15:05:21	kini	david: the plan is for Sage 6 to be git-based
2013-05-28 15:05:39	kini	I'm not sure how well it's really going to go, though
2013-05-28 15:05:52	bkero	kini, mythmon: For webdev pushes, we have one admin box that 'git pull's, then we cp -rv * into another repo, apply some local files on top of that, git commit -a -m 'autogen push', then issue a 'git pull' on all the webheads.
2013-05-28 15:06:13	bkero	The guys who invented that system didn't even know about --depth 1
2013-05-28 15:06:16	kini	maybe we should have just used a centralized-like system like gerrit instead of trying to do github-style pull requests
2013-05-28 15:08:00	mythmon	bkero: not all webdev things, but yeah.
2013-05-28 15:08:20	david	kini: off-topic: does sage have any support for doing calculations with physical units? support for units was just added to mathematica 9
2013-05-28 15:08:56	bkero	mythmon: almost all :) That's how chief works
2013-05-28 15:09:39	kini	david: I think there is something for that
2013-05-28 15:09:54	kini	I remember looking at a ticket about rewriting it though so maybe it's not very good
2013-05-28 15:10:11	kini	honestly I don't really use Sage much or at all myself :)
2013-05-28 15:10:58	mythmon	bkero: i know.
2013-05-28 15:14:20	bkero	mythmon: know a way to profile a running python process?
2013-05-28 15:15:16	mythmon	bkero: sad.
2013-05-28 15:15:23	bkero	:(
2013-05-28 15:15:25	bkero	Corbin: ^
2013-05-28 15:21:52	Corbin	bkero: What kind of profiling do you desire?
2013-05-28 15:22:06	bkero	Corbin: hopefully attach to a running process and getting a stack trace
2013-05-28 15:22:10	Corbin	(You can't patch in most profiling and debugging; you have to have intentionally desired it from the beginning.)
2013-05-28 15:22:19	bkero	Corbin: I could presumably http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/gdbinit
2013-05-28 15:22:22	bkero	pystack
2013-05-28 15:22:26	Corbin	bkero: Oh, that's possible. There's a gdb plugin for CPython somewhere.
2013-05-28 15:22:34	Corbin	Yeah, looks like you've got it.

2013-05-28 15:30:31	bkero	MaddHatter: a computer running chrome :)
2013-05-28 15:30:38	bkero	It's not very happy.
2013-05-28 15:31:10	MaddHatter	a computer running lots of chromes, I guess. I was thinking it was showing processes across lots of computers (which would have been pretty cool?)
2013-05-28 15:31:12	mythmon	bkero: how many of those are processes and how many are threads?
2013-05-28 15:31:25	mythmon	MaddHatter: just one chrome, many tabs, most likely.
2013-05-28 15:31:54	MaddHatter	mythmon: yeah. for chrome, lots of chromes =~ lots of tabs
2013-05-28 15:32:11	bkero	mythmon: what's the difference?
2013-05-28 15:32:21	mythmon	tabs are not 1:1 with processes.
2013-05-28 15:32:27	mythmon	more like 4:1
2013-05-28 15:32:31	mythmon	(not constant)
2013-05-28 15:32:52	MaddHatter	I thought it used at least a separate thread per tab
2013-05-28 15:33:01	mythmon	nope.
2013-05-28 15:33:10	MaddHatter	how does it decide then?
2013-05-28 15:33:12	mythmon	which is why one tab can crash several.
2013-05-28 15:33:14	mythmon	i don't know.

2013-05-29 12:10:07	bkero	I wanted to fix connectbot's keyboard input to support my asus transformer
2013-05-29 12:10:23	bkero	There's no good way to do it. Connectbot doesn't have proper meta or escape keys :|
2013-05-29 12:21:47	mythmon	bkero: there is hope
2013-05-29 12:21:59	mythmon	there is a fork with real support for the asus transformer 1.

2013-05-29 12:23:08	mythmon	it worked for me
2013-05-29 12:23:22	mythmon	I got escape and control to work in vim.
2013-05-29 12:23:25	bkero	Maybe you tried it after I did, was still pretty awful. Missed key entries, etc.
2013-05-29 12:23:39	mythmon	this was... about a year ago.

2013-05-29 14:42:35	Corbin	The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was on-the-dot with this; they had a delightful little MySQL session that was very correct.

2013-05-29 15:20:39	MaddHatter	I almost wonder if they didn't intentionally put it invalid IPs so a rush of breathless geeks wouldn't start port-scanning some random guy in elbonia whose IP happened to be the one shown

2013-05-30 14:12:19	kini	I'm running a gentoo variant, funtoo, actually - which has installation instructions on funtoo.org
2013-05-30 14:12:19	kini	as for gentoo itself I think it's on the website as well, hang on
2013-05-30 14:13:16	kini	http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml
2013-05-30 14:13:22	kini	this is what I used the last time I installed gentoo
2013-05-30 14:13:29	kini	basically just a long list of instructions

2013-05-30 23:00:30	sabreman	So i've been messing with my nexus 7 today
2013-05-30 23:00:37	sabreman	and in the breef span of one whole hour
2013-05-30 23:00:58	sabreman	I've managed to totlay fuck it up sp much, that i had to wipe everything, and side load the vanilla bootloader back in
2013-05-30 23:01:01	sabreman	lulz
2013-05-30 23:01:10	sabreman	then i'
2013-05-30 23:01:17	sabreman	i'll need to re-install the os
2013-05-30 23:01:22	sabreman	THEN i'll beable to try and flash it again
2013-05-30 23:01:32	sabreman	#yofo
2013-05-30 23:03:32	sabreman	(you only flash once)
2013-05-30 23:04:46	kini	lol
2013-05-30 23:05:26	sabreman	aaand we're back to square one, yay!
2013-05-30 23:05:50	sabreman	I think that's enough tinkering for me for one day.....
2013-05-30 23:05:59	kini	what exactly do you mean by "messing with"...
2013-05-30 23:06:06	sabreman	Well....
2013-05-30 23:06:37	sabreman	Basicly I unlocked it, rooted it, and tryed flashing cyanogenmod with the gapps thing
2013-05-30 23:06:51	kini	why did you root a nexus 7
2013-05-30 23:06:52	sabreman	it all worked pretty well, excpet the keyboard was totaly broken when i booted
2013-05-30 23:07:02	sabreman	for th3 lulz
2013-05-30 23:07:05	sabreman	anyway
2013-05-30 23:07:12	kini	aren't the nexus series all rooted from the factory
2013-05-30 23:07:20	kini	and unlocked for that matter
2013-05-30 23:07:21	sabreman	so i decied to try and fix it, by re-flashing with a newer version of both
2013-05-30 23:07:26	sabreman	and totaly fucked something up
2013-05-30 23:07:26	kini	what did you even do
2013-05-30 23:07:34	sabreman	no they're not
2013-05-30 23:07:53	sabreman	locked up tightly
2013-05-30 23:08:25	sabreman	so yea, at that point in time i did a serisous of stupid things wich bascily landed me with nothing but the hardcoded firmware on the thing
2013-05-30 23:08:45	sabreman	so i had to go into recovery mode, and like i said, side load the bootlader back in so i could reinstall the os
2013-05-30 23:08:58	sabreman	also had to install some drivers on my pc to actualy do all this
2013-05-30 23:09:10	sabreman	so all-in-all, it was a rather.... interesting expreiance.
2013-05-30 23:09:32	clarkb	that was the nice thing about the nook. you couldn't brick the thing as it would always attempt to boot off of sd first
2013-05-30 23:09:33	kini	sounds like pretty standard procedure for installing stuff on a phone
2013-05-30 23:10:00	sabreman	This is my first andrid device
2013-05-30 23:10:04	clarkb	cat image > /dev/sdb and pop the sucker in all better
2013-05-30 23:10:12	sabreman	and the first time i've tried rooting/unlcoking anything
2013-05-30 23:10:21	sabreman	the fun par twas
2013-05-30 23:10:27	kini	I'm pretty surprised that you needed to unlock or root a nexus 7
2013-05-30 23:10:27	sabreman	i couldnt actualy acces the device for a bit
2013-05-30 23:10:31	sabreman	it wouldnt connect
2013-05-30 23:10:33	kini	were you going off some instructions somewhere?
2013-05-30 23:10:43	sabreman	i ahd to find some new drivers for it to let it talk to my pc
2013-05-30 23:10:55	sabreman	i was initially
2013-05-30 23:10:59	sabreman	til the whole keyboard thing
2013-05-30 23:11:38	sabreman	and that's where everything when horribly wrong (i'd like to think that's a coinsidence (but we all know it's not))
2013-05-30 23:12:19	kini	where are the instructions?
2013-05-30 23:12:42	sabreman	fuck
2013-05-30 23:12:49	sabreman	i cant copy/paste betwene the vm and my pc. hold on
2013-05-30 23:13:16	sabreman	http://nexus7.wonderhowto.com/how-to/definitive-nexus-7-guide-bootloader-unlocking-rooting-installing-custom-recoveries-0144705/
2013-05-30 23:13:39	sabreman	like i siad, everything was fine while i was following the guide.
2013-05-30 23:13:57	sabreman	so that's not the issue. However I would LOVE to figure out what was causing my keyboard to glitch out
2013-05-30 23:14:07	sabreman	without braking my tablet again
2013-05-30 23:14:56	sabreman	I've done a bnch of googling on it, and it seems to be a missmatch ion versions between cyanogenmod and gapps.
2013-05-30 23:15:09	sabreman	saddly the versions that i tried didn't work to well.
2013-05-30 23:15:29	sabreman	Anyway, I actualy need to go do homework now, so if you guys do get any fantastic ideas please pm me
2013-05-30 23:19:06	kini	this guide linked you to wugfresh's nexus root toolkit, that's good at least
2013-05-30 23:19:29	kini	that program has most of what you need
2013-05-30 23:19:37	kini	you'll also need adb and drivers
2013-05-30 23:19:58	kini	well you might not need adb I guess but it's pretty useful
2013-05-30 23:20:45	sabreman	I bascily was hanign on to this thing throughout this ordeal lol
2013-05-30 23:20:52	sabreman	used quite a few of it's features
2013-05-30 23:21:11	sabreman	I'm actualy quite proud of the fact that i managed to recue myself without another guide

2013-05-31 00:56:28	kini	He died in Madrid on 1 November 1700, five days before his 39th birthday. According to the medical coroner, Charles' body "contained not a single drop of blood, his heart looked like the size of a grain of pepper, his lungs were corroded, his intestines were putrid and gangrenous, he had a single testicle which was as black as carbon and his head was full of water."

2013-05-31 10:27:37	stacybird	on the why the naked, either: because you want to
2013-05-31 10:28:01	stacybird	but the original idea on the WNBR is to promote the idea that cyclists are naked on the road
2013-05-31 10:28:11	@cbeck	Huh, I didn't know that
2013-05-31 10:28:26	stacybird	too true having been the receiving end of a Car vs bike

2013-05-31 10:29:04	stacybird	yay physics
2013-05-31 10:30:44	Kraytul	Some help though.
2013-05-31 10:30:50	Kraytul	layers of clothing are NOT layers of skin.
2013-05-31 10:31:16	Kraytul	it's like having a few more layers of material before your flesh takes damage, which is very useful considering the amount of scraping going on
2013-05-31 10:31:31	Kraytul	Clothes wont prevent serious injury, but the flesh-wounds will be less severe.
2013-05-31 10:31:37	stacybird	nah, the blunt trauma = broken things
2013-05-31 10:31:45	stacybird	abrasions aren't the worst
2013-05-31 10:31:55	stacybird	unles you're drug
2013-05-31 10:32:05	Kraytul	It really depends.
2013-05-31 10:32:21	Kraytul	Having a scab the length of your body is worse than the few places it went through clothes.
2013-05-31 10:32:28	bkero	layers of leather ARE layers of skin
2013-05-31 10:32:36	stacybird	yeah.  friend who was drug for 4 blocks was happy she had a. a helmet and b. 3 layers of clothing
2013-05-31 10:33:00	Kraytul	layers of clothing are good...
2013-05-31 10:33:04	stacybird	lots of things broke, but she still knew why she way

2013-05-31 10:51:23	dcolish	Kraytul: you love hibernate!
2013-05-31 10:52:30	Kraytul	dcolish: We switched over to using Play Framework which uses Ebean on the backend, I can safely say that having tried the alternative, I do like hibernate better.
2013-05-31 10:53:20	Kraytul	Ebean is stateless, which means things happen when you do them, you have to explicitly invoke transactions in order to use them at all.  But I really do like the control hibernate offers.  Also I imagine hibernate could be set up to be more auto-flush than we had it before.

2013-05-31 13:36:22	Kraytul	pilgrimd: I guess you're right, polar geometry is for flatland... spherical geometry is for us.
2013-05-31 13:36:55	Kraytul	if only we could properly measure the dimension we vary in... we could use hyperspherical geometry to coordinate our location...
2013-05-31 13:36:58	pilgrimd	polar geometry is just a scheme used to validate the theory the earth is flat.

2013-05-31 13:40:24	pilgrimd	I work with a couple of guys taking ESL classes.  There is much commentary in Portugese about the quality of English grammatical structure.
2013-05-31 13:40:37	zacharyp	"quality"
2013-05-31 13:41:00	Corbin	English is on par with C++ or PHP in readability, scrutability, and maintainability.
2013-05-31 13:41:09	Corbin	I think we only put up with it because it's so expressive.
2013-05-31 13:41:15	zacharyp	fuck yea
2013-05-31 13:41:40	sabreman	^^ prefect example of this languages expressiveness
2013-05-31 13:41:47	Corbin	Well.
2013-05-31 13:42:44	pilgrimd	I think any language that allows both double-negative and double-positive meanings is flawed.
2013-05-31 13:42:50	Corbin	Okay, so I disagree with somebody. I can say any of the following, and they all mean something different: "Well." "Yes, but." "And yet." "I guess?" "Meh." "If you say so." "I suppose." "Yeah, okay." "Yeah, sure."
2013-05-31 13:43:12	sabreman	also my favorite: "Well, my well is doing well today"
2013-05-31 13:43:15	Corbin	And I don't think any of them are grammatically valid sentences; they're all fragments.
2013-05-31 13:43:34	Corbin	Maybe IYSS is valid, but I doubt it.
2013-05-31 13:43:45	zacharyp	positively not fragments
2013-05-31 13:43:45	pilgrimd	Corbin: Not all are fragments, and none of them are in disagreement unless you assume sarcasm.
2013-05-31 13:44:10	 *	zacharyp always assumes sarcasm with English speakers

2013-05-31 13:45:29	kini	what's wrong with that? :)
2013-05-31 13:46:16	pilgrimd	kini: "we vary in" isn't a correct phrasing if it comes at the end of the sentence

2013-05-31 13:48:03	pilgrimd	You'd have to phrase it, "I will not put up with people insisting on not ending sentences with prepositions."
2013-05-31 13:48:10	kini	yes, it's only a joke ;) but actually that admonition has been traced to the 17th century literature critic, if I remember correctly
2013-05-31 13:48:16	pilgrimd	bah, and I get a logic flaw. XD

2013-05-31 14:15:33	bkero	instead of dash L
2013-05-31 14:15:39	mythmon	i tried that, and was never really able to get it to work.
2013-05-31 14:18:28	bkero	dash R 0.0.0.0, by default it only listens on localhost
2013-05-31 14:18:29	bkero	on localhost
2013-05-31 14:22:50	mythmon	ah. hmm, lets try that.
2013-05-31 14:25:12	mythmon	ssh -R 8900:0.0.0.0:8900 host.com -N
2013-05-31 14:25:15	mythmon	doesn't work.
2013-05-31 14:25:42	mythmon	then curl host.com:8900
2013-05-31 14:26:06	mythmon	same if I add another 0.0.0.0 in front.
2013-05-31 14:26:06	bkero	mythmon: Err, no

2013-05-31 14:26:51	greghaynes	you have to have gateway ports enabled which is usually disabled by default

2013-05-31 14:27:17	kini	just use 0, not 0.0.0.0
2013-05-31 14:27:17	kini	it's shorter, plus I think it might also include all IPv6 interfaces while 0.0.0.0 doesn't (?)
2013-05-31 14:27:37	greghaynes	or just specify -G I think
2013-05-31 14:27:46	greghaynes	theres some flag for bind to any
2013-05-31 14:29:33	mythmon	mwaha.
2013-05-31 14:29:38	mythmon	that did it.
2013-05-31 14:29:42	mythmon	the Gateway option.
2013-05-31 14:29:55	bkero	Damns gateway option
2013-05-31 14:30:28	mythmon	for posterity, the final command that worked was: ssh -R 0:8900:localhost:8900 fr.elem.us -N
2013-05-31 14:31:46	bkero	cool
2013-05-31 14:55:27	clarkb	why doesn't ssh -L8900:localhost:8900 work?
2013-05-31 14:56:20	bkero	clarkb: it binds to localhost
2013-05-31 14:56:55	clarkb	so -L0:8900:localhost:8900 then
2013-05-31 14:57:10	clarkb	I guess I expect both -R and -L to work, but I am also multitasking
2013-05-31 14:57:53	greghaynes	by default sshd has a config option that prevents you from binding to any addr
2013-05-31 14:59:29	bkero	greghaynes: the man sshd_config page says it prevents remote connections from establishing against listening esrvices, does it do that by preventing binding to non-loopback interfaces?
2013-05-31 14:59:59	bkero	clarkb: basically just man sshd_config search for 'GatewayPorts'
2013-05-31 15:01:39	greghaynes	no idea

2013-05-31 15:14:40	jesusaurus	i was reading that man page a week or two ago
2013-05-31 15:17:17	clarkb	I do -L8888:localhost:8888 all the time

2013-05-31 18:47:05	LinusT	Hi everybody.
2013-05-31 18:51:46	LinusT	Can I git some advice?
2013-05-31 18:52:05	TheShazbot	No, but you can subvert some advice
2013-05-31 18:52:19	LinusT	You're my svn grace!
2013-05-31 18:53:59	LinusT	I'm working on my first git-controlled project. In my short experience, if I try to push a commit, and it contains a file that has changed in the repo since my last pull, the push will fail with a conflict. That sound right?
2013-05-31 18:56:21	clarkb	only if a conflict exists
2013-05-31 18:57:38	LinusT	Well, I've noticed that lately a certain group member's pushes keep overwriting my changes, if she has worked on a file I just changed.
2013-05-31 18:59:29	LinusT	My conspiratorial mind wants to attribute some malice to her. My theory has been that she has worked on these changes before pulling in my changes. Her push then fails for that reason. So she just does whatever is needed to ignore the conflict, and it overwrites what I contributed.
2013-05-31 18:59:42	LinusT	Is there a more reasonable explanation for what's happening?
2013-05-31 19:01:03	clarkb	if you force push it will replace X with Y. or it is possible that the merge conflicts are not being properly resolved
2013-05-31 19:01:31	clarkb	eg resolve conflict by using old instead of new veraion
2013-05-31 19:02:19	LinusT	As I look at the diffs at github, it looks like it's always "resolved" by deleting the changes I made in my last commit and adding her new changes.
2013-05-31 19:38:10	LinusT	Aight, thanks.
2013-05-31 19:44:02	bret	thats no good
2013-05-31 19:45:04	bret	Did you figure it out LinusT ?
2013-05-31 19:45:11	LinusT	I went ahead and let her know about the problem in a friendly, non-blamey way. We'll see if it happens again.
2013-05-31 19:45:39	LinusT	bret: Well, she seemed evasive, though she also claimed she always pulls right before committing any changes.
2013-05-31 19:45:58	bret	are you all working off the master branch?
2013-05-31 19:46:27	LinusT	bret: For this part we were, yeah.
2013-05-31 19:46:46	Corbin	LinusT: You should know that you can use git-reflog to see what your commit IDs were, and then use git-merge to merge your changes onto hers.
2013-05-31 19:46:57	bret	http://wheningit.tumblr.com/post/24435109513/when-someone-tries-to-work-off-master
2013-05-31 19:47:00	Corbin	So your work doesn't have to be lost just because she doesn't know how to git.
2013-05-31 19:48:04	LinusT	bret :)
2013-05-31 19:48:36	LinusT	Corbin: Oh, thanks!
2013-05-31 19:49:11	bret	or better yet go through some merges with the person so they know how to do it properly
2013-05-31 19:50:02	clarkb	and use topic branched
2013-05-31 19:50:27	LinusT	OK, this is all good advice.
2013-05-31 19:51:46	bret	so if you are behind the branch you are pushing to, and you force push, the commit you push cuts in front of the history you didn't pull first?
2013-05-31 19:53:05	bret	can you git blame the person who did the force push? http://wheningit.tumblr.com/post/32888926393/when-someone-says-theyre-going-to-do-a-git-blame-im
2013-05-31 19:54:49	LinusT	Heh. I'm gonna just let it go this time.
2013-05-31 19:58:55	LinusT	Hey, know why the Portland developer couldn't get hired?
2013-05-31 19:59:42	LinusT	He insisted on all local variables, and kept on making obscure references.
2013-05-31 20:01:35	bret	Haha
2013-05-31 20:01:42	bret	Portland!
2013-05-31 20:01:53	LinusT	Yes.
2013-05-31 20:09:16	MaddHatter	there's a git pull --rebase to make that work better
2013-05-31 20:12:02	LinusT	MaddHatter: Nice
2013-05-31 20:21:14	bret	I always though rebase was more about getting the history to look a certain way
2013-05-31 20:29:07	MaddHatter	it's all about getting history to look a certain way. There's different philosophies. I prefer a history that's mostly linear. Some people prefer a history that's got a lot of branches and merges.
2013-05-31 20:30:40	MaddHatter	if you make a branch for Feature A, and then someone adds Feature B, would you rather your history look like base <- B <- A, or have both A and B branch from base, then an extra merge in A to incorporate B, then a merge of A back into the main line
2013-05-31 20:31:16	MaddHatter	(the former uses rebase to "move" A on top of B just before it's committed to the main line)

2013-05-31 20:53:59	kini	it'll fail a lot more often than that
2013-05-31 20:54:52	kini	if any more commits have been added to the particular branch on the upstream repo at all, whether or not they touch the same files you've touched, then you need to get those commits and reintegrate your commits with them before you push back to that same branch
2013-05-31 20:55:28	clarkb	it won't fail with a conflict though
2013-05-31 20:55:34	clarkb	it will argue about non fast forward ness
2013-05-31 20:55:50	kini	yes
2013-05-31 20:56:01	kini	won't it always give that message?
2013-05-31 20:56:02	kini	this is when pushing
2013-05-31 20:56:51	kini	I mean, when failing due to conflicts between the states of the repos
2013-05-31 20:56:51	kini	git push doesn't do anything to your local repo and your local repo is where file-based conflicts come from (i.e. depending on what's actually happening in the working directory)
2013-05-31 21:00:01	clarkb	yeah I guess it wouldn't fail with a conflict it would fail with a non fast forward error

2013-05-31 21:38:25	MaddHatter	clarkb: I understand why people use the other approach, but what matters to me is how usable is the history, not how accurately does history represent the actual development.
2013-05-31 21:38:50	MaddHatter	if you really cared about accuracy, you wouldn't allow commit --amend or rebase, even locally before pushing.
2013-05-31 21:39:19	MaddHatter	but then everybody in the world would see all your stupid mistakes, and that's not a terribly appealing idea to me :-)

2013-05-31 23:44:50	Wren	METALLLLLL
2013-05-31 23:45:01	jesusaurus	i do like the new arch install
2013-05-31 23:45:06	Wren	(I have a freekbox that isn't being used, so why not)
2013-05-31 23:45:20	jesusaurus	mostly because its the only thing i could load onto this here macmini2,1
2013-05-31 23:45:35	Wren	And holy crap the default shell is zsh which I've never used but it's already my favourite shell after 5 minutes.
2013-05-31 23:45:36	+alevar	jesusaurus: The install process?
2013-05-31 23:45:44	+alevar	wah?
2013-05-31 23:45:51	jesusaurus	both the process and the media
2013-05-31 23:45:53	+alevar	Pretty sure the default shell is bash
2013-05-31 23:45:59	Wren	zsh for me
2013-05-31 23:46:01	Wren	As root
2013-05-31 23:46:07	Wren	In the live usb boot
2013-05-31 23:46:20	+alevar	I miss the pretty GUI. :(
2013-05-31 23:46:27	Wren	I downloaded the image a couple of weeks ago.
2013-05-31 23:46:29	jesusaurus	yeah its zsh with fancy tab completion
2013-05-31 23:46:35	+alevar	curses UI, whatever it is.
2013-05-31 23:46:54	@kennobaka	bash++ vi++ dwm++ arch++ go++
2013-05-31 23:46:55	@kennobaka	discuss
2013-05-31 23:47:05	jesusaurus	i like the whole 'heres 10 ways to pxe into arch' thing
2013-05-31 23:47:24	jesusaurus	do you mean vim++ +
2013-05-31 23:47:26	jesusaurus	?
2013-05-31 23:47:32	greh	vim++
2013-05-31 23:47:53	@kennobaka	I really mean vim?++
2013-05-31 23:48:04	@kennobaka	but I don't think that karmabot handles regexes like that
2013-05-31 23:48:13	jesusaurus	no, it doesnt
2013-05-31 23:48:27	@kennobaka	mgood: I have a feature request: ^^
2013-05-31 23:48:45	jesusaurus	{vim?}++
2013-05-31 23:48:52	@kennobaka	/vim?/
2013-05-31 23:49:04	@kennobaka	actually, /^vim?$/, probably
2013-05-31 23:49:04	jesusaurus	something to denote regex syntax
2013-05-31 23:50:01	@kennobaka	I can't see any possible way this could be exploited
2013-05-31 23:50:09	@kennobaka	/./++++
2013-05-31 23:51:02	jesusaurus	because (c)++ didnt have enough karma
2013-05-31 23:51:17	@kennobaka	c++ can never have enough karma
2013-05-31 23:52:11	jesusaurus	i really like how (c)++ finally grew into go++
2013-05-31 23:52:17	@kennobaka	yeah
2013-05-31 23:52:20	@kennobaka	you're welcome
2013-05-31 23:52:41	jesusaurus	as if you had anything to do with it
2013-05-31 23:52:55	jesusaurus	i havent actually used the language since it hit 1.0
2013-05-31 23:53:16	jesusaurus	ive just been hacking in python++ recently
2013-06-01 00:05:48	kini	c grew into go?
2013-06-01 00:13:56	kini	btw any rust people in here?
2013-06-01 00:14:02	kini	karmabot: rust
2013-06-01 00:14:03	karmabot	rust(1)
2013-06-01 00:14:08	kini	wat
2013-06-01 00:14:36	kini	karmabot: rust is http://rust-lang.org/
2013-06-01 00:14:37	karmabot	Alright, kini.
2013-06-01 00:15:20	jesusaurus	i heard theres a rust "kernel" that paints the screen red then halts

2013-06-01 14:55:28	sabreman	hmm
2013-06-01 14:55:30	sabreman	i have to say
2013-06-01 14:55:37	sabreman	sysfixed is a nice font
2013-06-01 14:55:50	sabreman	erm
2013-06-01 14:56:11	sabreman	fixedsys (on windows)
2013-06-01 14:56:34	sabreman	the only problem with it is bolding it looks kinda bad
2013-06-01 14:56:41	pilgrimd	Try Lucida Console
2013-06-01 14:57:00	sabreman	oh dam
2013-06-01 14:58:09	sabreman	although i can tell that it's not desinged to be used at 9pt, and not at all without cleartype
2013-06-01 14:58:18	pilgrimd	It even does a nice job of differentiating "1", "I" and "l".
2013-06-01 14:59:00	pilgrimd	I use it at 8-14 pt without cleartype.
2013-06-01 15:01:01	sabreman	oh that's nice
2013-06-01 15:01:11	sabreman	at 8 point it's bold looks great
2013-06-01 15:01:17	kini	I hate lucida console for some reason
2013-06-01 15:01:31	sabreman	m and d kinda blur together, but thats the only thing wrong
2013-06-01 15:01:55	sabreman	ihave to say though, the colors look A LOT better with fixedsys (mainly because it's so huge and fat)
2013-06-01 15:02:06	sabreman	kini: what do you use?
2013-06-01 15:02:11	kini	on Windows, Consolas
2013-06-01 15:02:27	kini	on linux, fixed 6x13 :3
2013-06-01 15:02:55	sabreman	problem is
2013-06-01 15:03:18	sabreman	all of ms's fonts, are desinge to be viewd at a minimum of like 12pt, AND with cleartype
2013-06-01 15:03:27	kini	that's true
2013-06-01 15:03:54	kini	I really like fixed 6x13, it's so tiny
2013-06-01 15:03:55	sabreman	lololololl
2013-06-01 15:04:01	sabreman	size 36 fixed sys
2013-06-01 15:04:13	sabreman	my disaply is only like 30x20 chars
2013-06-01 15:04:28	kini	hah
2013-06-01 15:04:42	sabreman	out of all of these i think fixedsys is my favorite
2013-06-01 15:05:11	sabreman	i use profont on my linux vm
2013-06-01 15:05:21	sabreman	and when coding
2013-06-01 15:05:29	sabreman	but fixedsys seems to be perfect for this
2013-06-01 15:05:33	kini	cannot stat 'Leopold Godowsky - Symphonic Metamorphosis on Kunstlerleben.mp3': No such file or directory
2013-06-01 15:05:33	kini	what the hell lol
2013-06-01 15:05:33	kini	is "git bash" silently converting ü to u or something
2013-06-01 15:05:59	sabreman	i'm not seeing a ü in that filename
2013-06-01 15:06:07	kini	exactly
2013-06-01 15:06:19	kini	the original filename is Leopold Godowsky - Symphonic Metamorphosis on Künstlerleben.mp3
2013-06-01 15:06:39	sabreman	are you trying to use git as a bash shell on windows?
2013-06-01 15:06:52	kini	and when I run "for x in * ; do adb push "$x" 'sdcard/Music' ; done" in git bash I get that error
2013-06-01 15:06:53	kini	yes I am lol
2013-06-01 15:07:02	kini	because I don't know or care how to do for loops in Windows BAT syntax
2013-06-01 15:07:25	kini	assuming for loops even exist in Windows BAT syntax
2013-06-01 15:08:24	sabreman	use python
2013-06-01 15:08:29	sabreman	i tried using bat
2013-06-01 15:08:37	sabreman	and learned that i sohuld use python
2013-06-01 15:08:45	sabreman	alos i'm fairly sure git isn't unicode
2013-06-01 15:08:56	kini	uh
2013-06-01 15:09:01	kini	what do you mean by "git isn't unicode"
2013-06-01 15:09:10	sabreman	hmm, let me think on that one
2013-06-01 15:09:44	kini	also think about how much more verbose the python version of the bash code I just pasted would be
2013-06-01 15:09:52	sabreman	I should refrase : "Perhaps git isn't unicode"
2013-06-01 15:10:08	kini	yeah I still don't understand what you mean by "being unicode"
2013-06-01 15:10:39	sabreman	for file in os.listdir('.'):
2013-06-01 15:11:00	sabreman	like git doesnt do utf-8 encoding, and just uses ascii
2013-06-01 15:11:19	kini	that's wrong
2013-06-01 15:11:30	sabreman	then idk what to tell you
2013-06-01 15:11:48	kini	anyway this has nothing to do with git
2013-06-01 15:11:55	sabreman	oh wait i do, use python :p
2013-06-01 15:12:09	kini	it's just the windows port of bash which msysgit (a windows port of git) installs
2013-06-01 15:12:25	kini	<sabreman> for file in os.listdir('.'):
2013-06-01 15:12:26	kini	keep going...
2013-06-01 15:12:38	sabreman	?
2013-06-01 15:12:52	kini	that's not the verbose part
2013-06-01 15:13:01	sabreman	OOOHHH, i didnt see the rest lol
2013-06-01 15:13:39	sabreman	gime a sec
2013-06-01 15:14:05	kini	subprocess.check_call (or whatever) ("adb push \"{}\" 'sdcard/Music'".format(file), shell=True)
2013-06-01 15:14:07	kini	or something like that
2013-06-01 15:14:24	kini	and plus, shell=True is discouraged because of security concerns or some such bs so really you should be doing
2013-06-01 15:14:43	kini	subprocess.check_call(["adb", "push", "\"{}\"".format(file)])
2013-06-01 15:14:47	kini	jesus christ
2013-06-01 15:14:55	kini	bash exists for a reason ;)
2013-06-01 15:15:29	sabreman	http://pastebin.com/ga3MBLBa
2013-06-01 15:15:31	kini	also that code will throw an exception if any of the transfers fails whereas the bash code will proceed
2013-06-01 15:15:39	sabreman	since python loves indentation, wnated to put it there
2013-06-01 15:16:00	kini	yuck, string concatenation instead of .format() ? how non-pythonic! :P
2013-06-01 15:16:18	sabreman	hey man, I'm just starting to use it for actual scirpting
2013-06-01 15:16:41	kini	also you should be using os.path.join not "\" or "/"
2013-06-01 15:16:42	kini	for portability!
2013-06-01 15:16:44	sabreman	I always kinda ignored it for some reason, till yestreday i had to rename like 40 files
2013-06-01 15:16:49	sabreman	and made a python script
2013-06-01 15:17:00	sabreman	then i'm like "holy shit, this langauge is actualy usefull!"
2013-06-01 15:17:04	kini	furthermore the path 'sdcard/Music' is on my android phone so you shouldn't have converted them to \ anyway

2013-06-01 15:17:43	kini	I find that for automation of stuff that you'd normally be typing on the command line, bash is pretty much the perfect language

2013-06-01 16:15:25	david	listen to that, then help fight a patent troll: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/help-save-podcasting
2013-06-01 16:37:54	LinusT	They interview the guy whose son invented the term "patent troll", who's now the worst patent troll himself. Oh, man, does he make an arse of himself.
2013-06-01 17:35:44	+alevar	LinusT: The son is a patent troll?
2013-06-01 17:49:55	Wren	Well, next week I get to find out if Puppet wants to move forward with the app process.
2013-06-01 17:50:34	Wren	Nervous as fuck
2013-06-01 18:00:14	sabreman	man
2013-06-01 18:00:30	sabreman	this version of weechat doesn't have the newest version of aspell
2013-06-01 18:00:37	sabreman	i can't have suggestions D:
2013-06-01 18:00:57	sabreman	although i guess i could zip up my own version and push it on here.
2013-06-01 18:44:34	sabreman	do you guys know, how i can port my weechat configs and stuff, from this version (0.3.7) to version 0.4.4?
2013-06-01 18:44:42	sabreman	just copy/pasting the files didn't work to well
2013-06-01 18:58:30	pilgrimd	Set up some new VPSes in europe today, one nice thing about Europe's internet: http://pastie.org/7994972
2013-06-01 19:17:43	mythmon	sabreman: do you know about /upgrade ?
2013-06-01 19:17:57	sabreman	i just tried it
2013-06-01 19:18:04	sabreman	everything works fine
2013-06-01 19:18:14	sabreman	except it's not loading perl, python, and aspell plugins
2013-06-01 19:18:22	sabreman	for both this, and my freshily compiled version
2013-06-01 19:18:23	mythmon	odd
2013-06-01 19:18:25	sabreman	ik
2013-06-01 19:18:35	sabreman	now i'm stuck with a default client on both ends D:
2013-06-01 19:18:47	sabreman	i *think* i have to compile all the plugins i want manualy
2013-06-01 19:18:55	sabreman	but i don't feel like doing that today lol
2013-06-01 19:18:59	mythmon	that's really weird.
2013-06-01 19:19:02	sabreman	yea
2013-06-01 19:19:08	mythmon	are you compiling weechat from source?
2013-06-01 19:19:18	sabreman	yea
2013-06-01 19:19:21	mythmon	why?
2013-06-01 19:19:26	mythmon	what distro?
2013-06-01 19:19:46	sabreman	w/e distro rita uses
2013-06-01 19:19:57	sabreman	and also that's why
2013-06-01 19:19:59	mythmon	ah.
2013-06-01 19:20:05	sabreman	cause i dont have root and cant do a package
2013-06-01 19:20:17	sabreman	so i'm *trying* to make a "portable" version
2013-06-01 19:20:23	sabreman	with all the dependancies packaged in
2013-06-01 19:20:33	sabreman	so i can just upload one tar, untar and run when i need it
2013-06-01 19:20:35	mythmon	also... 0.4.4 ?
2013-06-01 19:20:39	sabreman	i mean .1
2013-06-01 19:20:44	mythmon	k
2013-06-01 19:20:45	sabreman	didn't look all the way
2013-06-01 19:20:53	mythmon	also, what you want is a static binary.
2013-06-01 19:21:01	mythmon	as opposed to a dynamic binary.
2013-06-01 19:21:01	sabreman	i have no idea what i'm doing man
2013-06-01 19:21:03	sabreman	lol
2013-06-01 19:21:04	mythmon	i know
2013-06-01 19:21:10	sabreman	this is what i did:
2013-06-01 19:21:17	mythmon	static binary will include all the libs, but it is still kind of a weird thing to want.
2013-06-01 19:21:31	sabreman	is that a command i feed cmake?
2013-06-01 19:21:48	sabreman	i get the concept (i use statics on my c++ projects)
2013-06-01 19:22:02	sabreman	i just never did it on linux/ with cmake before
2013-06-01 19:22:07	mythmon	idk
2013-06-01 19:22:10	mythmon	man cmake
2013-06-01 19:22:11	sabreman	D:
2013-06-01 19:22:16	sabreman	*k
2013-06-01 19:22:20	mythmon	i'm just giving you a keyword to notice.
2013-06-01 19:22:53	clarkb	you don't need a static build if you just want it portable to the cats ubuntu machines
2013-06-01 19:23:20	clarkb	it can live in your homedir and it will be safe to start it across their infrastructure
2013-06-01 19:23:54	mythmon	just if you want it portable between other machines, like a gentoo box or something, you need static.
2013-06-01 19:24:02	mythmon	but that's probably more trouble than it is worth...
2013-06-01 19:56:48	greghaynes_	to cmake to cmake .;make
2013-06-01 19:57:03	greghaynes_	change that second to to do
2013-06-01 19:59:35	LinusT	alevar: Nah, the guy was a patent [defense] lawyer for Amazon, and he switched to the dark side. The son just gets credit for the term "patent troll".

2013-06-02 11:08:52	sabreman	So, now that i think about it
2013-06-02 11:08:59	sabreman	i think the newer version of weechat
2013-06-02 11:09:16	sabreman	will probably need newer versions of pythong, perl, and aspell
2013-06-02 11:10:32	sabreman	but honeslty i have no idea
2013-06-02 11:10:52	mythmon	sabreman: did you try asking one of the CAT admins to install the new version of weechat with their admin powers?
2013-06-02 11:11:46	sabreman	ITS TO LATE NOW, IM DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
2013-06-02 11:11:57	sabreman	besides, i really do wanna figure this out on my own
2013-06-02 11:12:07	sabreman	if i get totaly stuck, then i'l ask.
2013-06-02 11:12:38	sabreman	i just wish there was more information avalible on this online
2013-06-02 11:12:53	sabreman	ther's basicly zero form what i've been able to find D:
2013-06-02 11:14:04	mythmon	sabreman: if you can read ebuilds, this will be useful: http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/net-irc/weechat/weechat-9999.ebuild?view=markup
2013-06-02 11:14:36	mythmon	or the arch PKGBUILD, which is simpler: https://github.com/archhurd/packages/blob/master/extra/weechat/PKGBUILD
2013-06-02 11:16:01	sabreman	yea 
2013-06-02 11:16:18	sabreman	we have a much older version of ruby and python on here then what weechat expects
2013-06-02 11:16:27	sabreman	it doest load them as dependencies 
2013-06-02 11:17:14	sabreman	WEll thing is, i already know what it needs/depends on
2013-06-02 11:17:19	greghaynes	cimpile you a pythong
2013-06-02 11:17:30	sabreman	my problem now, is how the heck do i make python,ruby,aspel, and tcl portable?
2013-06-02 11:17:36	clarkb	weechat needs python 3.3 ? rita should have newish 2 and 3
2013-06-02 11:17:54	greghaynes	not sure why you put effort into making it 'portable'
2013-06-02 11:18:01	greghaynes	just ld_preload for great justice
2013-06-02 11:18:42	mythmon	sabreman: i think you need to define portable.
2013-06-02 11:18:43	greghaynes	or lib search path, even
2013-06-02 11:18:55	greghaynes	Im guessing youre trying to statically compile all the libs
2013-06-02 11:19:01	greghaynes	which is fun...but probably not worth it
2013-06-02 11:20:05	sabreman	Portalbe: after i'm done, iwant to be able to tar the weechat folder, send it to some other machine, untar, and run it perfectly regardless of what they have installed (to an extent ofcourse)
2013-06-02 11:20:25	greghaynes	why?
2013-06-02 11:20:30	greghaynes	for the luls?
2013-06-02 11:20:32	sabreman	also, we actualy do have the required version of ruby
2013-06-02 11:20:35	sabreman	so i ahve no idea.
2013-06-02 11:20:47	sabreman	because the weechat on here is outdated, and i want to keep my version up to date
2013-06-02 11:20:56	sabreman	without having to ask admins to install it
2013-06-02 11:21:05	greghaynes	then just build it on the couple boxes you run it on
2013-06-02 11:21:10	mythmon	sabreman: what you are suggesting is difficult, and not possible for all systems.
2013-06-02 11:21:29	sabreman	well
2013-06-02 11:21:32	sabreman	:/
2013-06-02 11:21:51	mythmon	for one, if you run on a different architecture, you're out of luck.
2013-06-02 11:22:03	greghaynes	well, in one direction you are
2013-06-02 11:22:18	sabreman	is rita 32bit?
2013-06-02 11:22:19	mythmon	in generally you will find only 64 bit, but there are also ARM devices.
2013-06-02 11:22:34	sabreman	i don't think any of the boxes here are arm
2013-06-02 11:22:42	greghaynes	theres some sparc ones
2013-06-02 11:23:01	mythmon	sabreman: most popular arm device: raspberry pi
2013-06-02 11:23:13	sabreman	Let me rephrase, i want that "prtability" to work on most of PSUs servers
2013-06-02 11:23:25	mythmon	more doable.
2013-06-02 11:23:25	clarkb	yeah conpile once use nfs
2013-06-02 11:23:26	sabreman	does that seem more plausible?
2013-06-02 11:23:40	clarkb	no need to tar or use static compiles
2013-06-02 11:23:46	mythmon	but since most PSU servers are pretty much the same, you don't need to do much.
2013-06-02 11:23:59	sabreman	ok so
2013-06-02 11:24:04	sabreman	back to the core of this issue
2013-06-02 11:24:16	sabreman	how the heck do i get it to recognize ruby and python
2013-06-02 11:24:18	sabreman	lol
2013-06-02 11:24:21	mythmon	the core is you want a newer weechat
2013-06-02 11:24:25	mythmon	don't confuse the issue.
2013-06-02 11:24:36	sabreman	well,i already ahve a newver weechat up and running
2013-06-02 11:24:46	sabreman	and it has it's own directory
2013-06-02 11:24:57	sabreman	so the plugins/libs are my next problem
2013-06-02 11:25:02	sabreman	and i have no idea how to fix that
2013-06-02 11:25:31	mythmon	sabreman: my vote is that you didn't turn on the flag to compile python support.
2013-06-02 11:25:55	mythmon	s/vote/bet/
2013-06-02 11:26:05	sabreman	seeing as i didnt change any vonfigs, you're probably right
2013-06-02 11:26:14	sabreman	i'll go and dig through the make files to see if i can find something
2013-06-02 11:26:55	mythmon	sabreman: http://www.weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#dependencies
2013-06-02 11:27:03	mythmon	do you have python-dev and ruby-dev ?
2013-06-02 11:27:20	sabreman	yea iv'e been looking at that
2013-06-02 11:27:26	sabreman	does rita have thoes?
2013-06-02 11:27:44	mythmon	I don't actually go to PSU. idl/.
2013-06-02 11:27:48	mythmon	*idk
2013-06-02 11:28:00	mythmon	apt-cache search python-dev
2013-06-02 11:28:57	sabreman	yea the're all there
2013-06-02 11:31:07	sabreman	I'm lookginthrought he config file for make, and it seems like all of them are enabled by defualt
2013-06-02 11:35:50	sabreman	so i just rebuild it, and kept a close eye on the logs
2013-06-02 11:36:07	sabreman	It's actualy finding ruby and python, but not perl and aspel
2013-06-02 11:36:09	sabreman	this si strange
2013-06-02 11:41:39	sabreman	ughh

2013-06-02 22:21:42	 *	bkero has been watching Vice, another HBO series.
2013-06-02 22:21:48	uncountable	at least, there have been many that weren't nearly as good
2013-06-02 22:21:51	bkero	Just started earlier tonight. It's _really_ good.
2013-06-02 22:21:56	clarkb	it has. That particular scene was slightly underwhelming for me. The written POV was much more enraging
2013-06-02 22:22:32	kini	the scene in question http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anV48ukkgXQ
2013-06-02 22:22:33	uncountable	i've read that after he finished that book, he had to go back and rewrite that scene more than once
2013-06-02 22:22:47	uncountable	already on youtube, i love it :-)
2013-06-02 22:22:49	kini	this is so muddy, can't see anything

2013-06-02 22:23:02	Kraytul	I haven't watched the series beyond the first season.
2013-06-02 22:23:29	bkero	Last episode they met a south korean priest and joined him in Laos as they picked up four North korean women who fled to China only to be pressed into live webcam sex trade. The Vice guys followed the entire underground railroad to Thailand where they got arrested by Thai police but got the South Korean embassy to give them Visas.
2013-06-02 22:23:37	uncountable	well i recorded it via my iPhone and put in youtube, idk why it'd be muddy ;-)
2013-06-02 22:23:39	bkero	(more than y'all probably wanted to know, but *PLUG*)
2013-06-02 22:24:37	clarkb	I have heard good things about VICE but every time I go to watch they only have one episode available on HBO Go and I go "meh"
2013-06-02 22:24:56	bkero	clarkb: There's also a web site, they used to run a video series, and that video series was so good that HBO approached them to make a show.

2013-06-02 22:29:00	bkero	Yeah, after the British occupation ended a lot of Indians fled to Pakistan and Pakistanis fled to India. One of the cities they founded right across the border was a second Mumbai.

2013-06-03 12:57:55	dcolish	david: if I bind a series of monads with (>>) or (>>=), how does haskell determine the order they are evaluated in?

2013-06-03 12:59:05	 *	Epitrope makes them all case insensitive
2013-06-03 12:59:18	bkero	OH my god Jareth had his own wikipedia page.
2013-06-03 12:59:33	Corbin	dcolish: It depends! Most Monads really insist on evaluating the actions in order, because of the data dependency.
2013-06-03 12:59:55	bkero	...There was a Labyrinth manga? W.T.F.
2013-06-03 13:00:09	dcolish	Corbin: thats what i basically figured. mostly i'm interested in the >> case
2013-06-03 13:00:12	Corbin	A couple weird Monads (mostly anything that has an instance for MonadFix) can evaluate actions as-needed, and each of them is a little quirky.
2013-06-03 13:00:38	david	dcolish: it depends on how >> and >>= are defined for your monad
2013-06-03 13:00:40	Corbin	dcolish: Ah, usually the first action happens before the second action, but the inner value might not be fully evaluated.
2013-06-03 13:00:57	bkero	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Labyrinth
2013-06-03 13:01:33	dcolish	ok so there isnt a scheduling mechanism in the runtime for bindings
2013-06-03 13:01:37	Corbin	For example, State's (>>) is roughly: (s -> (a, s)) -> (s -> (b, s))
2013-06-03 13:01:54	david	dcolish: nope. they're like any other function call
2013-06-03 13:01:54	Corbin	No, they're desugared all the way to normal function application, *except* for IO and ST.
2013-06-03 13:02:09	Corbin	IO and ST can be thought of as strict in their entire application.
2013-06-03 13:02:15	dcolish	i'm not interested in IO/ST at this time
2013-06-03 13:02:36	dcolish	ok dokee, well that kind of helps
2013-06-03 13:02:37	Corbin	But yeah, in that State example, all of the `s` are going to eventually evaluate, but that `a` might get discarded.
2013-06-03 13:03:15	dcolish	>> has no requirement on retaining the resulting value
2013-06-03 13:03:19	dcolish	iirc
2013-06-03 13:03:55	Corbin	Right.
2013-06-03 13:04:25	dcolish	ok i think thats enough for me to get what i need done. I was mostly curious if there were any external mechanisms in play
2013-06-03 13:04:33	david	ST isn't special either
2013-06-03 13:04:53	Corbin	I thought that ST was special, because of STToIO.
2013-06-03 13:05:12	dcolish	i wouldnt have to build my own freaking pipeline if i was writing haskell, so i might as well copy what i can from haskell since I'm not using hasekl
2013-06-03 13:06:22	Corbin	Heh.
2013-06-03 13:06:53	Corbin	At this point in my life, I'm pretty convinced that that old saying about large apps eventually reinventing Lisp is correct, but it's not actually Lisp; usually the reinvention is of *Prolog*.
2013-06-03 13:07:00	dcolish	haha
2013-06-03 13:07:22	dcolish	i think they're both true
2013-06-03 13:07:32	dcolish	you usually want both
2013-06-03 13:07:38	bkero	Corbin: MySQL reinvented prolog? :3
2013-06-03 13:07:55	Corbin	bkero: Wait, does MySQL have an inner Lisp!?
2013-06-03 13:08:04	bkero	Corbin: Lulz no
2013-06-03 13:08:25	Corbin	Anyway, this was after dash and I noticed that Parsley now implements a more-or-less complete Prolog/ML series of clause matches.
2013-06-03 13:10:42	bkero	Corbin: I'd love an explanation on how XSLT is actually LISP.
2013-06-03 13:11:57	Corbin	bkero: I wouldn't be surprised!

2013-06-03 14:13:09	Wren	Do you think puppet would care more about the technical interview or the cultural interview?
2013-06-03 14:13:52	nightfly	both are probably important

2013-06-03 14:15:30	Wren	I did pretty good on the technical interview but was a little more shaky on the questions about team work.
2013-06-03 14:15:48	Wren	Not really worked on a team before.

2013-06-03 14:16:55	Wren	Yeah, but that's a different sort of team.
2013-06-03 14:17:16	pilgrimd	The second rule of team work is: we do not talk about team work
2013-06-03 14:17:21	nightfly	Maybe I should force nixians to actually work on group projects
2013-06-03 14:17:27	pilgrimd	The third rule of team work is: if this is your first team, you have to work
2013-06-03 14:18:39	clarkb	most of my experience has been that while you work in a team you never really work on a group project

2013-06-03 14:18:48	clarkb	everyone gets distinct components

2013-06-03 14:20:03	greghaynes	I dunno, me and zacharyp pair a lot on our team
2013-06-03 14:21:04	zacharyp	I have done plenty of team work projects, and I do agree with clarkb, many of them become distinct components of work
2013-06-03 14:21:12	greghaynes	yea, we do that on and off
2013-06-03 14:21:31	zacharyp	usually you decide upon on the interfaces between components before work, but then once that is done, get cracking
2013-06-03 14:21:53	greghaynes	yea... think theres sometimes thats ok, lots of times thats not
2013-06-03 14:22:12	eidolon	Wren: they are both important but if you bomb the cultural you are fucked
2013-06-03 14:22:31	Wren	Well, I don't think I *bombed* it.
2013-06-03 14:22:34	zacharyp	I do like pairing though =D
2013-06-03 14:22:39	eidolon	weak on tech is magnitudes more forgivable than a bad culutre fit

2013-06-03 14:22:52	zacharyp	hell yea
2013-06-03 14:23:25	zacharyp	you can teach tech to a smart dude, whereas hard to teach respect to a rude dude
2013-06-03 14:23:31	eidolon	^
2013-06-03 14:23:35	Wren	And I got along quite well with the people I would be working with. I was just less confident on the "how would you handle this situation" question.

2013-06-03 14:24:10	greghaynes	yea, tech skills arent hard to teach comparatively, and people tend to also stick around and do better when you have to teach them up
2013-06-03 14:25:13	Wren	Hmm. Guess I'll find out in a few days.
2013-06-03 14:34:37	TheShazbot	at least you won't be like that guy I know who absolutely adores puppet as a company
2013-06-03 14:34:43	TheShazbot	but is kind of a shitty person/fit
2013-06-03 14:34:59	TheShazbot	I hope that you didn't hire him :)
2013-06-03 14:37:28	Wren	I'm definitely not that guy

2013-06-03 15:06:12	Kona	"Sparkle" is a color, right?
2013-06-03 15:07:03	Corbin	Her name was a joke; they subtly altered it from the original plan after the Twilight movie came out.
2013-06-03 15:07:08	TheShazbot	don't know, let's ask bkero
2013-06-03 15:07:14	TheShazbot	this seems like a pony reference
2013-06-03 15:08:45	Kona	I don't think your formula holds very well, Corbin
2013-06-03 15:08:57	Corbin	Kona: Yeah, this grammar sucks.
2013-06-03 15:09:52	Corbin	Kona: Also G4 ponies can be named pretty much anything as long as it's not a normal human name, apparently.
2013-06-03 15:10:18	Kona	There are 4 generations?
2013-06-03 15:10:55	Kona	80s ponies are the only true ponies.

2013-06-03 15:11:33	Corbin	G4 is the current TV show and toys. G2 and G3 are the hilariously deformed half-human things that you might remember from your childhood.
2013-06-03 15:11:50	Corbin	I know all this from my older sisters, who had shelves full of them.

2013-06-03 15:14:35	Sunshine	*more
2013-06-03 15:15:21	Corbin	They're cartoons. I'm willing to trade "looks like animal" for "gives me nightmares."

2013-06-03 15:40:43	Corbin	But I appreciate your temerity. I *also* thought this. :3
2013-06-03 15:40:54	mythmon	Is that the truth in C?
2013-06-03 15:40:58	Corbin	But no, apparently you can define operator->() if you like.
2013-06-03 15:40:59	mythmon	to be fair, I don't think I know C++
2013-06-03 15:41:02	Corbin	Yeah, you're right in C.
2013-06-03 15:41:10	mythmon	oh. I didn't even think about operators.
2013-06-03 15:41:34	zacharyp	(operator overloading)--
2013-06-03 15:41:36	clarkb	you can override , in C++
2013-06-03 15:41:39	clarkb	zacharyp++
2013-06-03 15:41:43	Corbin	So the expression has to be fully resolved before it can be expanded, and it has no automatic desugaring.
2013-06-03 15:42:01	Corbin	*Also* the expression can't be typechecked until it's resolved.
2013-06-03 15:42:14	Corbin	And that's because operator->() can be overloaded by type!
2013-06-03 15:42:14	mythmon	on the one hand, I love having operator overloading for things like vector + vector.
2013-06-03 15:42:25	david	but can you overload ;
2013-06-03 15:42:36	zacharyp	that sounds ... dangerous
2013-06-03 15:42:45	Corbin	I don't think so, but you can overload operator*() and operator.(), so.
2013-06-03 15:42:56	zacharyp	; is not an operator
2013-06-03 15:42:57	clarkb	and ,
2013-06-03 15:43:07	Corbin	And operator[]() too. Fuck C++.
2013-06-03 15:43:09	david	that's lame!
2013-06-03 15:43:14	@cbeck	But you can always #define ;
2013-06-03 15:43:20	mythmon	Corbin: well, python can do that stuff too.
2013-06-03 15:43:21	Corbin	Hahahah~
2013-06-03 15:43:32	clarkb	mythmon: and if you it I will probably want to hunt you down

2013-06-03 15:43:35	Corbin	mythmon: Yeah, but Python's got a much more reasonable approach to the types.
2013-06-03 15:43:46	clarkb	mythmon: pkgresoruces is so bad because they don't get operator overloading

2013-06-03 15:47:40	mythmon	dependency injection?
2013-06-03 15:47:44	Corbin	Only Java would have such a wacky type system as to require DI.
2013-06-03 15:47:53	Corbin	mythmon: Oh man, you don't know about this crap?
2013-06-03 15:47:57	mythmon	not by name.
2013-06-03 15:48:01	clarkb	mythmon: see guice. basically write xml to determine how your classes are constructed at run time
2013-06-03 15:48:13	mythmon	that sounds gross.

2013-06-03 15:49:40	Corbin	Imagine that you have a class Cls. Cls would like a value implementing interface I. You'd like to call Cls.withI(I(some_value_resembling_i))
2013-06-03 15:49:47	Corbin	Now, imagine that you're doing this in Java. :3
2013-06-03 15:50:11	zacharyp	DI can be nice, really
2013-06-03 15:51:23	Corbin	You'll note that this doesn't exist for sufficiently-dynamically-typed languages, because their type systems aren't out to get them.
2013-06-03 15:51:52	Corbin	Well, except for JS and PHP, where devs feel that no bad idea should go unported. :3
2013-06-03 15:52:48	Corbin	See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control
2013-06-03 15:53:03	zacharyp	as for DI through Guice or Spring, it is all pretty much supported by annotations instead of xml in the past few years
2013-06-03 15:53:24	Corbin	It's just... lemme quote exarkun here.
2013-06-03 15:53:39	clarkb	zacharyp: don't you still have xml somewhere that actaully tells guice what to inject into the thing annotated with @inject?
2013-06-03 15:53:46	Corbin	"If you have some data x, and a function f, and you want to have that function do things with that data, maybe what you want to do is f(x)."
2013-06-03 15:53:54	zacharyp	I've never used Guice
2013-06-03 15:53:55	clarkb	Corbin++
2013-06-03 15:54:04	zacharyp	but with Spring, you can get by with almost no xml
2013-06-03 15:54:09	Corbin	Also: Inversion of Control is when you have data x, and a function f, and you decide inexplicably to do x(f).
2013-06-03 15:54:58	zacharyp	injecting logging libraries, or database access libaries, all of which just match an interface, means that the injected class does not need to know anything about what it is getting, other than the interface
2013-06-03 15:55:48	zacharyp	otoh, I'm kinda glad to be out of that world now ;)
2013-06-03 15:56:05	clarkb	I always feel like you can set your logger or put it in the constructor
2013-06-03 15:56:17	clarkb	having external files to sort that out (in xml no less) is braindead
2013-06-03 15:56:39	zacharyp	meh, the xml is a non-argument for any projects that keep up to date
2013-06-03 15:57:07	Corbin	The XML's really not the problem. The problem is that it's hard in Java to take an interface and pick a class which implements that interface at runtime.
2013-06-03 15:57:18	zacharyp	that is what Spring does
2013-06-03 15:57:28	clarkb	Corbin: you would need to fall back on class implementations of the interface
2013-06-03 15:57:34	clarkb	which isn't quite as flexible I suppose
2013-06-03 15:57:37	clarkb	(if you want easy)
2013-06-03 15:57:38	zacharyp	there's a reason most large Java projects in the business world use Spring
2013-06-03 15:57:58	Corbin	clarkb: Right. But it's hard to reflect and reify Java classes in a clean and quick way.
2013-06-03 15:58:19	zacharyp	if you think DI is insane, you should try OSGI
2013-06-03 15:58:32	zacharyp	taking interface abstraction to whole other level
2013-06-03 15:58:35	Corbin	try { SpecializedClass specializedClass = (SpecializedClass) genericClass; }
2013-06-03 16:01:52	zacharyp	that won't be possible when working with generics due to type erasure
2013-06-03 16:03:49	Corbin	Exactly!
2013-06-03 16:04:15	Corbin	Yay for Java's types being *just* static and strong enough to get in the way, but too weak to actually enforce runtime type checks.
2013-06-03 16:05:34	zacharyp	I think my favorite class name I ever wrote while in the JVM world was ServiceServiceFactory
2013-06-03 16:06:04	zacharyp	or ServiceServiceFactoryImpl
2013-06-03 16:06:44	zacharyp	thankfully, while in that world, it was 95% Scala, and very little Java

2013-06-03 17:28:42	Epitrope	Corbin: so, if you're not using dependency injection, how are you testing your code?
2013-06-03 17:29:20	Corbin	Epitrope: Which "me?" Me at work or me at home?
2013-06-03 17:29:41	Corbin	Actually, I guess it's not too different in either place. I'm primarily writing Python, so I can test a unit by importing it and executing it repeatedly.
2013-06-03 17:33:07	Epitrope	one of the things DI allows you to do is to inject mocks to help test your code without it talking to the rest of the world
2013-06-03 17:33:29	Epitrope	Corbin: how do you approach that problem?
2013-06-03 17:34:54	Corbin	Epitrope: In the rare case that I actually need a mock, I class WhateverMockINeed(object): ...
2013-06-03 17:35:00	Corbin	But not often.
2013-06-03 17:35:14	Corbin	And there's not really any "injection" happening. Everything is explicitly called.
2013-06-03 17:36:12	Corbin	For example, let's take the rather daunting tests at https://github.com/bravoserver/bravo/blob/master/bravo/tests/plugins/test_physics.py
2013-06-03 17:36:54	Corbin	These tests are carefully verifying properties of a physics controller which operates on large chunks of geometry, with the assistance of several supporting objects.
2013-06-03 17:37:32	Corbin	*But*, because each object is isolated and doesn't depend on anything external, there's no problem simply instantiating these chunks of geometry, putting a physics controller onto them, and calling the controller's methods directly.
2013-06-03 17:38:31	 *	Epitrope studies
2013-06-03 17:38:35	Epitrope	Corbin++ examples++
2013-06-03 17:39:10	Corbin	But the rest of the world's already been abstracted away. There's no disk access; there's an explicit "serializer" object that saves things to disk, or database, or whereever. (And a serializer that just keeps an in-memory copy, for testing and specialized setups.)
2013-06-03 17:39:34	Corbin	Similarly, all network access is abstracted by what Twisted calls a "protocol," which represents a network connection without any networking machinery.
2013-06-03 17:40:20	Corbin	I think that the most important thing, though, is remembering that units need to be simple. If a method would prefer a string-like object with string-like properties and methods, why not use a str to test?
2013-06-03 17:40:44	Corbin	And then if you want to have some sort of super-string class that you'll use in production, test that super-string class on its own.
2013-06-03 17:41:05	Epitrope	right, I agree with that
2013-06-03 17:41:48	Corbin	I just wouldn't call any of this DI, because there's nothing in here which isn't normal everyday Python. Python doesn't care about the types of things that you import or call, so there's no need to convince the type system that you're following the rules with any kind of annotations.
2013-06-03 17:42:29	Epitrope	types seem to me to be orthogonal to DI
2013-06-03 17:43:30	Corbin	I think that the dynamicism of your types (or lack thereof) informs the kind of testing that you can do, that's all.
2013-06-03 17:43:48	clarkb	python makes DI unnecessary
2013-06-03 17:44:01	Corbin	Also: The bravo.utilities package is specialized for pure units which are functions. Look how much simpler tests in that area are: https://github.com/bravoserver/bravo/blob/master/bravo/tests/utilities/test_chat.py
2013-06-03 17:45:29	Epitrope	Corbin: well sure, when there are no dependencies, you don't need dependency injection
2013-06-03 17:45:35	Epitrope	clarkb: why is that?
2013-06-03 17:46:06	clarkb	Epitrope: because you aren't restricted by the type system
2013-06-03 17:46:20	clarkb	python will keep executing your code until it can't then throw an exception
2013-06-03 17:47:03	clarkb	if you need to use a mock in your tests just swap foo() out with bar() and you are done
2013-06-03 17:47:25	clarkb	you don't need a complicated framework that looks outside your code to figure this out
2013-06-03 17:47:50	greghaynes	kinda gets back to the type thing, its all enforced only at run time
2013-06-03 17:48:21	Corbin	Well, it's not even a type check; it's a whole bunch of simpler checks.
2013-06-03 17:48:35	Corbin	*Most* code doesn't actually isinstance(). (That code which does, should DIAF.)
2013-06-03 17:48:45	greghaynes	hehe, was just about to comment on that
2013-06-03 17:48:53	greghaynes	sucks but theres some libs out there you kinda have to :(
2013-06-03 17:49:21	greghaynes	mostly relating to derpy encoding

2013-06-04 09:48:37	+alevar	I need to come up with a body paint design for the World Naked Bike Ride. Suggestions?
2013-06-04 09:49:43	MaddHatter	how much effort do you want to put into it?
2013-06-04 09:50:41	+alevar	I'm willing to put in 1 to 1-1/2 hours. 3 colors max (including mixing two colors).
2013-06-04 09:51:22	+alevar	It takes a while to get that much paint on a 6'3" frame.
2013-06-04 09:53:15	MaddHatter	zombie? Could probably do that pretty will with red+white+black
2013-06-04 09:53:18	+alevar	I suppose I can do more than 3 colors. Tempera's cheap.
2013-06-04 09:53:32	+alevar	red white black?
2013-06-04 09:53:58	+alevar	I usually think of zombies as being a little more... greenish.
2013-06-04 09:54:34	MaddHatter	http://vegan-grindhag.tumblr.com/post/24742299821/nymphxvx-a-zombie-makeup-using-a-combination is sort of what I was imagining
2013-06-04 09:55:24	+alevar	Oh god, no. That didn't take an hour for one person to put on.
2013-06-04 09:57:12	+alevar	How does a US flag sound?
2013-06-04 09:58:28	+alevar	A face of blue with white "stars", then alternating white/red strips on the body?
2013-06-04 10:00:49	clarkb	well technically the flag is supposed to be oriented as it would be if it were flying
2013-06-04 10:00:59	clarkb	so it depends on your riding position :)
2013-06-04 10:22:49	dcolish	uh really clarkb
2013-06-04 10:22:57	dcolish	getting technical with body paint?

2013-06-04 10:23:15	clarkb	this is why you see flags backwards on uniforms

2013-06-04 14:07:10	zacharyp	awesome!
2013-06-04 14:07:22	 *	zacharyp misses functional programming
2013-06-04 14:14:30	dcolish	lol
2013-06-04 14:14:36	dcolish	python is so close
2013-06-04 14:15:00	Corbin	I'll bite. What is required for "functional programming" which Python lacks?
2013-06-04 14:15:15	dcolish	immutability
2013-06-04 14:15:18	nightfly	better lambdas?
2013-06-04 14:15:32	Corbin	Scheme has mutable primitives. Is it not functional?
2013-06-04 14:15:33	dcolish	pattern matching
2013-06-04 14:15:51	clarkb	dcolish: there is a lib that adds pattern matching to python
2013-06-04 14:15:58	dcolish	scheme and lisp are not really functional as much as they are not procedural
2013-06-04 14:15:59	clarkb	where did that thing go. lisp macros too iirc
2013-06-04 14:16:00	zacharyp	I miss pattern matching so much
2013-06-04 14:16:06	Corbin	Python can pattern-match tuples. Is that not functional?
2013-06-04 14:16:27	zacharyp	it can, it's not pythonic to write your python like that
2013-06-04 14:16:30	zacharyp	so no one does
2013-06-04 14:16:31	Corbin	nightfly: What is missing? Python can create anonymous functions with two different kinds of syntax at any scope.
2013-06-04 14:16:37	dcolish	its not the same thing unless yhou want to go about describing every type in python as a tuple
2013-06-04 14:16:43	dcolish	tuples also happen to be immutable
2013-06-04 14:17:06	zacharyp	using named tuples would be where I would start to make python more functional
2013-06-04 14:17:13	dcolish	also you cant really deconstruct tuples in the way that pattern matching works
2013-06-04 14:17:27	zacharyp	match (*, *, "foo")
2013-06-04 14:17:30	zacharyp	doesn't work
2013-06-04 14:17:34	Corbin	Ah, you want *unification*.
2013-06-04 14:17:36	dcolish	you'll  still have block after block of if/else
2013-06-04 14:18:06	Corbin	And presumably you want to re-answer the question of whether strs and unicodes can be equal, as well as ints and floats.
2013-06-04 14:18:13	nightfly	Corbin: I guess my only gripe with Pythons anonymous functions doesn't effect functional programming as much as writing side-effecty callbacks. So kinda off topic.
2013-06-04 14:18:44	dcolish	Corbin: go ahead and write functional python
2013-06-04 14:18:50	Corbin	nightfly: I'm just confused as to the exact gripe; if you disassemble a lambda-keyword definition and a def-keyword definition, you'll see that they generate the same bytecode.
2013-06-04 14:18:53	david	Corbin: referential transparency!
2013-06-04 14:18:53	dcolish	it doesnt bother me
2013-06-04 14:18:54	zacharyp	there are very few companies that use functional programming
2013-06-04 14:19:06	Corbin	dcolish: Better; I write functional *C*.
2013-06-04 14:19:12	zacharyp	o.O
2013-06-04 14:19:23	 *	nightfly doesn't want a functional c...
2013-06-04 14:19:28	dcolish	sure why not
2013-06-04 14:19:31	Corbin	C has types for functions, function passing, and higher-order functions.
2013-06-04 14:19:42	Corbin	It lacks closures, but closures are not strictly necessary, just nice.
2013-06-04 14:20:02	Corbin	It also lacks parametric polymorphism, but again, that's a fancy thing and not necessary. :3
2013-06-04 14:20:26	kini	http://wcook.blogspot.com/2012/07/day-functional-programming-changed.html
2013-06-04 14:20:32	Corbin	Meanwhile, Prolog has pattern matching, unification, immutability, and no functions whatsoever.
2013-06-04 14:20:34	zacharyp	in regards to python, having None be iterable would go a long way
2013-06-04 14:20:34	dcolish	i'd argue closures and parametrics polymorphism are pretty essential
2013-06-04 14:20:50	dcolish	prolog also has a nice protobuf impl
2013-06-04 14:20:58	nightfly	Corbin: When I played with python it seemed like the lambda syntax didn't easily handle lambdas with multiple expressions.
2013-06-04 14:21:46	Corbin	nightfly: Oh, statements? Correct! But, fortunately, you can use def-statements at any scope.
2013-06-04 14:21:48	clarkb	zacharyp: use [] ?
2013-06-04 14:21:53	clarkb	or ()
2013-06-04 14:22:05	Corbin	nightfly: While the syntax might not be oriented towards this style, it's certainly still possible.
2013-06-04 14:22:14	Corbin	More importantly, it's friendlier syntax than C's. :3
2013-06-04 14:22:38	Corbin	(void*)(*func)(int, void*, (int)(*inner)(int, int))
2013-06-04 14:22:42	Corbin	Hurp.
2013-06-04 14:22:50	zacharyp	clarkb: sure, but there are plenty of functions out there returning None
2013-06-04 14:22:52	dcolish	<3
2013-06-04 14:23:32	Corbin	I have many ideas for ways to improve Python. They all start syntactically with removing semicolons, etc. and semantically with removing globals(), locals()...
2013-06-04 14:23:56	Corbin	Bikeshedding over whether reduce() should have a better default argument or whether sum() should be called foldl() is not really as interesting.
2013-06-04 14:24:30	nightfly	pythons decorators trip me up a bit. "lets have an expression that changes what the next one does!"
2013-06-04 14:24:45	nightfly	err, statement
2013-06-04 14:24:46	dcolish	decorators that take arguments are the best
2013-06-04 14:24:59	dcolish	also the decorator pattern is pretty common
2013-06-04 14:25:07	dcolish	people abuse them a lot
2013-06-04 14:25:38	dcolish	decorator is just a gang of 4 pattern
2013-06-04 14:26:28	Corbin	nightfly: Oh man, you asked for it: https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/flask-holster/blob/master/flask_holster/helpers.py
2013-06-04 14:26:50	dcolish	eh
2013-06-04 14:26:59	Corbin	Example usage: https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/airbrush/blob/master/airbrush.py#L80
2013-06-04 14:28:24	Corbin	There's abuse, and then there's the Reader Monad as a decorator. :3
2013-06-04 14:28:34	Corbin	To say nothing of @Deferred.addCallback in Twisted code.
2013-06-04 14:30:01	nightfly	Heh, so you complain about Common Lisp macro abuse and still write that. :)
2013-06-04 14:30:25	Corbin	Yeah, I'm a pretty horrible person. :3
2013-06-04 14:31:31	sabreman	woot, i can now connect to this from my nexus 7, and auto screen -r
2013-06-04 14:35:59	MaddHatter	someone who knows python better than me: does it support lexical variables and anonymous code refs?
2013-06-04 14:36:40	MaddHatter	i.e. can I do the equivalent of what in Perl would be my $subref = sub { return 0; }; ?
2013-06-04 14:36:47	Corbin	MaddHatter: Well, to get to the nitty-gritty, it has names and not variables, and objects do not need to have names.
2013-06-04 14:36:56	Corbin	You can certainly have: subref = lambda: 0
2013-06-04 14:37:06	MaddHatter	lambda: can only be an expression, not an entire block, though.
2013-06-04 14:37:47	Corbin	def subref(): return 0
2013-06-04 14:38:29	MaddHatter	can I do that as myvariable = def subref(): ...?
2013-06-04 14:38:37	Corbin	No, def is a statement.
2013-06-04 14:38:44	MaddHatter	hrmph.
2013-06-04 14:38:48	Corbin	Python's got a strong dichotomy between statements and expressions.
2013-06-04 14:38:51	zacharyp	http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=147358
2013-06-04 14:39:31	Corbin	MaddHatter: But, considering that `def <name>` just binds a function object to <name>, I'm struggling to see the difference.
2013-06-04 14:39:35	zacharyp	Guido's answer on why only an expression for a lambda
2013-06-04 14:39:38	MaddHatter	Corbin: scope
2013-06-04 14:39:42	david	lambda in haskell only takes a single expression too
2013-06-04 14:39:45	Corbin	MaddHatter: Same scope.
2013-06-04 14:39:49	Corbin	And same scoping rules.
2013-06-04 14:39:54	MaddHatter	Corbin: no, because modules don't protect their scope in python
2013-06-04 14:40:01	Corbin	MaddHatter: One second.
2013-06-04 14:40:06	MaddHatter	hence the question about lexical variables.
2013-06-04 14:40:21	zacharyp	haskell also has the aversion to braces
2013-06-04 14:40:33	MaddHatter	because the combination is what allows a function to exist only within a limited scope, instead of having it accessible globally, which is what I'm trying to find a way to avoid.
2013-06-04 14:40:53	Corbin	MaddHatter: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/2152/
2013-06-04 14:41:26	Corbin	MaddHatter: Oh, are you just trying to keep names from being exported out of your module?
2013-06-04 14:41:40	MaddHatter	not exported, I'm trying to prevent them from being accessible at all.
2013-06-04 14:41:42	Corbin	MaddHatter: Check the Python docs on __all__, which is a name you can set at module scope to control what's exported.
2013-06-04 14:41:59	MaddHatter	because even if I don't export it, some knobhead will do my.module.function to access it anyway.
2013-06-04 14:42:04	Corbin	Well, as long as people can import imp, inspect, and ast, you *cannot* prevent people from getting at your code if it's in a module which can be imported.
2013-06-04 14:42:39	Corbin	Because I can simply look at the file your code comes from, load it as an AST, drill down to the spot where your code object is defined, and directly call the code.
2013-06-04 14:42:58	Corbin	Maybe "simply" is the wrong word.
2013-06-04 14:43:20	Corbin	At any rate, you can see from this pastebin that the lambda-statement and def-statement are equivalent.
2013-06-04 14:44:55	Corbin	And yes, Python's got a philosophy of "We are all adults here" when it comes to access modifiers, since they don't work in any language that has them. If you explain a bit more about what you're trying to construct, maybe I can help suggest ways to build it.
2013-06-04 14:45:27	Corbin	But outside of hilariously-convoluted environments like Exocet and Safelite, there aren't any serious ways to do this. (And Exocet and Safelite are proofs of concept, not proven code.)
2013-06-04 14:45:34	@cbeck	Access modifiers exist to protect your code from you, not from other people
2013-06-04 14:45:42	MaddHatter	access modifiers don't work in, e.g. cpp?
2013-06-04 14:46:09	MaddHatter	cbeck: they're not intended to be protection from a molic
2013-06-04 14:46:25	MaddHatter	malicious attacker, but they are intended to prevent mistakes, whether by me or by someone else using my code
2013-06-04 14:46:36	Corbin	MaddHatter: There is a safe and reliable way to break C++'s access modifiers; one second.
2013-06-04 14:46:52	Corbin	http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/076.htm
2013-06-04 14:47:17	Corbin	There are similar techniques for Java and C#, although they rely on the nature of the runtime rather than the language's bare-metal semantics.
2013-06-04 14:47:49	dcolish	its very hard to break java's if you use a security manager
2013-06-04 14:47:56	dcolish	if you dont, its trivial
2013-06-04 14:48:18	MaddHatter	does java hide the object layout or something?
2013-06-04 14:48:24	dcolish	nope
2013-06-04 14:48:30	zacharyp	"trivial"
2013-06-04 14:48:34	MaddHatter	otherwise it seems like you should be able to figure out its offset and just grope around the heap/stack a bit
2013-06-04 14:48:37	dcolish	it sets access modifiers on the object
2013-06-04 14:48:39	Corbin	Java doesn't always let you reflect and reify data with arbitrary casts, which is how most people do bare-metal stuff.
2013-06-04 14:49:01	Corbin	In general, if you can serialize it, you can get at its guts. Java doesn't have serialization for all objects by default.
2013-06-04 14:49:57	Corbin	And C#, as we all know, is Java, so the same rules apply. >:3
2013-06-04 14:50:02	MaddHatter	I'm curious if someone has broken that model for Perl. I certainly wouldn't expect any such magic would be portable, at least.
2013-06-04 14:50:22	bkero	If only schwern were here...
2013-06-04 14:50:45	Corbin	I don't hear about such attacks on Perl as often, but Perl's not a language that people regularly deploy for client-side execution.
2013-06-04 14:50:49	dcolish	the java security manager is very difficult to circumvent
2013-06-04 14:50:51	MaddHatter	well actually... I guess you do have access to \*MAIN:: and so you could probably find a way.
2013-06-04 14:55:41	zacharyp	if someone has direct access to your executable files, I would not assume any security will be enough
2013-06-04 14:57:15	MaddHatter	the cpp link is interesting
2013-06-04 14:57:42	MaddHatter	it demonstrates my point, though, that cpp protects against accidental misuse, and python doesn't seem to have even that level of protection.
2013-06-04 14:58:07	zacharyp	as Corbin wrote, we are all adults here
2013-06-04 14:58:36	zacharyp	I'd rather use immutability for protection, rather than access level
2013-06-04 14:58:42	greghaynes	I havent heard of c++ private/public/protected being considered a security layer
2013-06-04 14:59:01	greghaynes	I think thats kind of pointed out in the intro section in most learnin c++ books, actually
2013-06-04 14:59:12	Corbin	I would prefer capability-oriented design. If you have an object, you have the *capabilities* which that object provides.
2013-06-04 14:59:41	Corbin	But you need a much higher-level way of looking at objects for that. For starters, no methods or attributes or properties; message passing only.
2013-06-04 15:00:07	MaddHatter	capability is just one design paradigm of encapsulation.
2013-06-04 15:00:47	Corbin	Well, that's what I thought, before I read the MarkM thesis.
2013-06-04 15:00:54	Corbin	http://erights.org/ is *full* of this stuff.
2013-06-04 15:01:07	MaddHatter	there's not a capability for "hold a bunch of related information together in one place" like what a struct does
2013-06-04 15:01:43	MaddHatter	and so you devolve into "try and provide capability that anyone would want with this collection of stuff" which you'll never fully anticipate
2013-06-04 15:02:13	Corbin	That's way too coarse-grained.
2013-06-04 15:02:28	Corbin	Don't think in terms of whitelists and blacklists. Think in terms of keys.
2013-06-04 15:02:56	Corbin	The house key, the safe key, and the key for the cupboard with all the cleaners... they're different keys.
2013-06-04 15:03:15	Corbin	Just because you let somebody into your house doesn't mean that you have to give them access to everything.
2013-06-04 15:03:37	MaddHatter	sure, but sometimes you want to
2013-06-04 15:04:13	Corbin	Right, so you'd go to the house owner and ask for a key, and provide a cause.
2013-06-04 15:04:22	Corbin	And then he decides whether you should hold a given key.
2013-06-04 15:04:48	greghaynes	so whats the third party you end up trusting?
2013-06-04 15:05:47	greghaynes	I guess elib
2013-06-04 15:05:48	Corbin	There isn't one. Access via capability is identical to access via the object handed to you by the keymaker.
2013-06-04 15:05:57	MaddHatter	I've lost track of the analogy. You ask for access to the house so you can execute arbitrary code on its contents, and if the house-owner says yes, how is that different from a struct?
2013-06-04 15:06:08	Corbin	You aren't asking for that.
2013-06-04 15:06:31	MaddHatter	then what are you asking for, and how is the house-owner to evaluate such a request?
2013-06-04 15:06:51	Corbin	Let's say that you have a House object, sure. You can ask it for its owner().
2013-06-04 15:07:16	Corbin	And you can ask the Owner for a Key to the House. The Owner gives you a Key based on your Credentials.
2013-06-04 15:07:37	Corbin	The thing here is that there's *no* introspection of these objects. Knowing how to reach an object, you can't do anything besides pass it a message.
2013-06-04 15:07:59	Corbin	And if you're not permitted to forge your own Keys, then it's gonna be a little hard to sneak your way into the House.
2013-06-04 15:08:22	MaddHatter	doesn't that imply that the builder of House must have anticipated everything I'll ever want to do with a House?
2013-06-04 15:08:38	MaddHatter	because if I want to do something with House that the builder didn't anticipate, there is no message to do the thing I want done
2013-06-04 15:09:06	Corbin	Yes; being able to talk to the House is equivalent to having the capabilities which that grants.
2013-06-04 15:09:17	Corbin	And you can't well do things that there is no capability to do.
2013-06-04 15:09:38	Corbin	If the House doesn't know the burndown() message, then you can't burn it down. Sorry.
2013-06-04 15:10:36	Corbin	This is the same kind of massive separation of concerns that, say, a REST API has, but at a very intimate level: all objects behave this way.
2013-06-04 15:11:06	MaddHatter	That seems like a very limiting model, and while it would work in some cases, there are many other cases where I'd rather not put up with such strictures.
2013-06-04 15:12:34	Corbin	Could you give an example? I'm building a new language based on this philosophy, and I'm interested in cases where it would be ineffective.
2013-06-04 15:12:56	bkero	Colleague of mine gave a Google Tech talk last week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j0NDGJVROI
2013-06-04 15:19:26	greghaynes	whats different from a language like smalltalk
2013-06-04 15:20:00	greghaynes	I havent done any smalltalk really, but as I understand it you can really only talk to other objects over message passing
2013-06-04 15:21:05	Corbin	This is a direct descendant of Smalltalk, yes.
2013-06-04 15:21:22	Corbin	Talking is pretty damn interesting as far as objects go, and it's unfortunate that people have forgotten it.
2013-06-04 15:21:56	greghaynes	talking?
2013-06-04 15:23:53	zacharyp	message passing
2013-06-04 15:24:06	greghaynes	ah, thought talking was some smalltalk thing I hadnt heard of
2013-06-04 15:24:29	greghaynes	Most the c++ code I work with is pretty message passing oriented...so its defintely a thing still
2013-06-04 15:24:49	Corbin	Oh, sorry; "Talker" is slang for a Smalltalk coder.
2013-06-04 15:24:57	Corbin	And so forth.
2013-06-04 15:42:30	MaddHatter	Corbin: any use of friend classes, for example. Single inheritance, multiple inheritance.
2013-06-04 15:43:19	MaddHatter	I'm making a dns class that encapsulates the capability of doing a dns lookup. But doing that lookup might take too long, so I also need another object to act as a watchdog timer on the dns lookup.
2013-06-04 15:43:25	Corbin	MaddHatter: What happens if there's no inheritance at all?
2013-06-04 15:43:40	MaddHatter	Corbin: no inheritance implies everything has-a, and nothing is-a
2013-06-04 15:44:09	Corbin	MaddHatter: It's still possible to get things done, though; composition is equivalent to all inheritance schemes.
2013-06-04 15:44:24	MaddHatter	the compositional model is useful -- look at any design patterns text -- but there's also cases where it doesn't apply
2013-06-04 15:45:40	Corbin	I haven't carried out a formal proof, but I can't think of any such case.
2013-06-04 15:46:54	MaddHatter	the composition model makes it impossible to restrict components of a composite, so everything ends up being really generalized, which hurts maintainability.
2013-06-04 15:47:38	nUbee	Hey everyone! This summer I'm planning on getting together a small group of people (5 or 6 maybe) to work on a coding project.
2013-06-04 15:47:40	Corbin	As somebody used to dynamic type systems, I guess I can't really see any objective basis to that.
2013-06-04 15:47:52	Corbin	nUbee: Sweet! Projects are awesome.
2013-06-04 15:48:03	nightfly	nUbee: https://lispinsummerprojects.org
2013-06-04 15:48:05	kini	what's the project?
2013-06-04 15:48:11	 *	nightfly has been plugging this all weeek
2013-06-04 15:48:14	nightfly	*week...
2013-06-04 15:48:16	nUbee	Yes, the objective is to get team experience and resume fodder
2013-06-04 15:48:25	nUbee	I've set up a channel #pound
2013-06-04 15:48:34	nUbee	where ideas can be dumped
2013-06-04 15:48:34	kini	sounds ominous
2013-06-04 15:48:39	nUbee	lol yes
2013-06-04 15:49:01	kini	btw did you fix your Ü troubles yet
2013-06-04 15:49:15	nUbee	apparently not, since I see "U
2013-06-04 15:49:23	+askore	heh
2013-06-04 15:49:36	 *	askore sees the Ü
2013-06-04 15:49:52	 *	tamgc seems umlaut U too
2013-06-04 15:50:00	nUbee	so anyway, the summer project doesn't have to be big, but it's something to do if anyone has free time
2013-06-04 15:50:30	nUbee	and wants to get some team experience
2013-06-04 15:51:10	MaddHatter	Corbin: consider any general specialized data type, like say an ipaddr class. There are a lot of things one might want to do with an ipaddr, and many of those things (dns lookup, for example) make sense in some other class (dnsquery class), but make no sense to include or support within the ipaddr class itself.
2013-06-04 15:51:33	MaddHatter	why should ipaddr support a message interface related to dns lookups? It's an ipaddr, not a dnsquery.
2013-06-04 15:51:59	MaddHatter	what makes sense in that case is for dnsquery to do things with an ipaddr, not to have the "capability" of an ipaddr.
2013-06-04 15:53:19	-->	eric (~eric@174.136.106.130) has joined #cschat
2013-06-04 15:55:23	Corbin	Right, so the DNSQuery object should have an internal reference to the IPAddr.
2013-06-04 15:55:28	MaddHatter	and for the no inheritance thing, suppose someone decides ipaddr isn't good enough and goes to invent IPv5. Now I need an ipv5addr object, and it's going to do a lot of what ipaddr does, but some things differently. Socket code doesn't want to have separate paths for ipaddr and ipv5addr. It just wants to make a socket. A compositional model doesn't allow the client code to makesocket(genericipaddr)... it has to makesocket(ipv4addr) ...
2013-06-04 15:55:34	MaddHatter	... and makesocket(ipv5addr)
2013-06-04 15:56:16	Corbin	Why can't IPv5Addr simply hold an IPAddr inside?
2013-06-04 15:56:27	MaddHatter	because what if I have an ipaddr that's v4, not v5?
2013-06-04 15:56:55	MaddHatter	it's not an is-a relationship, so I can't treat them the same
2013-06-04 15:57:44	Corbin	Why not? They accept the same messages.
2013-06-04 15:57:47	MaddHatter	or consider any use case ever for virtual functions... those don't -- can't -- work in a compositional model
2013-06-04 15:58:11	Corbin	I posit that every use case for virtual functions is meaningless in a dynamically-typed language.
2013-06-04 15:58:17	MaddHatter	Corbin: then you're discarding any typing?
2013-06-04 15:58:39	Corbin	MaddHatter: Nah, just the restriction that parameters and names must have a single static type.
2013-06-04 15:59:10	MaddHatter	it's starting to sound a lot like Perl, now.
2013-06-04 15:59:36	mythmon	as a side note, Corbin: is Haskell dynamic or static? I think it is static, with lots of inference and generics, but I want to be sure.
2013-06-04 15:59:46	Corbin	mythmon: It's static.
2013-06-04 15:59:49	mythmon	k
2013-06-04 16:00:09	Corbin	MaddHatter: Perl's a great example of a language that composes nearly everything. :3
2013-06-04 16:01:09	MaddHatter	Perl has both single and multiple inheritance
2013-06-04 16:01:24	MaddHatter	you _can_ choose a compositional model, of course, but nothing forces that choice
2013-06-04 16:01:24	Corbin	But how often do you use them in your day-to-day?
2013-06-04 16:01:39	MaddHatter	I'd argue if you're using multiple inheritance a lot, you're Doing It Wrong
2013-06-04 16:01:53	Corbin	But yeah. Inheritance leads to abstract functions. Inheritance leads to overloaded methods. Abstract functions and overloaded methods lead to multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance...leads to suffering.
2013-06-04 16:02:19	Corbin	Meh, there are "valid" "usecases" for MI.,

2013-06-04 20:27:58	nUbee	apparently my tty sessions won't draw anything on the screen. I know I can login, type stuff
2013-06-04 20:28:05	nUbee	but I get nothing on the screen
2013-06-04 20:32:00	kini	tty sessions? like virtual console?

2013-06-04 21:19:26	nUbee	kini: sorry, I had to step away for a wihle
2013-06-04 21:19:49	nUbee	I know that I can log in, because I actually type root
2013-06-04 21:19:51	nUbee	then the password
2013-06-04 21:19:53	nUbee	then reboot
2013-06-04 21:19:57	nUbee	and it actually reboots
2013-06-04 21:20:18	mythmon	nUbee: fresh install, or did this happen to a working system?
2013-06-04 21:20:48	nUbee	to be honest, I can't remember when exactly it happened... I installed it from a minimal install
2013-06-04 21:21:00	nUbee	then added packages as I went along
2013-06-04 21:21:12	nUbee	gdm,kdm,lightdm all seem to work fine
2013-06-04 21:21:30	nUbee	but when I go to ctrl-alt-f1 thru f6
2013-06-04 21:21:34	nUbee	just a blank screen
2013-06-04 21:21:51	nUbee	obviously at one point they all worked
2013-06-04 21:21:57	mythmon	ok.
2013-06-04 21:22:05	mythmon	what kind of graphics card? what driver?
2013-06-04 21:22:47	nUbee	fglrx from sid repo
2013-06-04 21:23:00	nUbee	AMD 5970
2013-06-04 21:23:27	mythmon	i don't recall, is fglrx the open source or proprietary driver?
2013-06-04 21:23:37	nUbee	proprietary
2013-06-04 21:23:52	mythmon	have you tried the open?
2013-06-04 21:24:03	nUbee	I'm pretty sure it's the same proprietary one that ubuntu installs
2013-06-04 21:25:06	pilgrimd	MaddHatter: Corbin: It's funny you used the subject of IP addresses.  This is already solved: you make an interface that accepts either address format with the necessary logic to determine type internally and dtrt.
2013-06-04 21:25:43	mythmon	nUbee: "this car has the same tires as that working one, therefore the problem is not the tires"
2013-06-04 21:27:46	nUbee	are you trying to say fglrx works like tires? because you might be right...
2013-06-04 21:29:11	pilgrimd	MaddHatter: And actually, most systems just internally use the mapped-address representation and doing everything on a single IPv6 stack with bits on the outside to open the actual ipv4 sockets.
2013-06-04 21:30:52	mythmon	nUbee: i'm saying complex interactions between the various parts of a linux system can cause unexpected failures.
2013-06-04 21:31:08	mythmon	that being said, I don't really have any idea what is wrong.
2013-06-04 21:31:58	nUbee	I knew what you're talking about, I was being a smart ass. sorry...
2013-06-04 21:32:40	nUbee	I apreciate any help though :)
2013-06-04 21:33:29	nUbee	some forums suggested changing resolutions in GRUB, does grub even affect virtual consoles?
2013-06-04 21:33:42	mythmon	it can.
2013-06-04 21:33:49	mythmon	or rather, options in grub can.
2013-06-04 21:33:59	mythmon	virtual consoles are draw outside of X
2013-06-04 21:34:25	kini	first thing that occurs to me is that you have multiple monitors and it's displaying on one that you're not looking at or is off
2013-06-04 21:34:29	mythmon	which means they are affected by the earlier video process, which can be affected by settings in your grub configs, especially those that affect the kernel.
2013-06-04 21:34:35	kini	(or doesn't exist and your kernel just thinks it does)
2013-06-04 21:34:42	mythmon	nUbee: do you know what KMS is?
2013-06-04 21:34:50	mythmon	kini: have you seen that happen?

2013-06-04 21:35:11	mythmon	interesting.
2013-06-04 21:35:20	mythmon	for me the virtual consoles have generally gone to all monitors.
2013-06-04 21:35:52	kini	some laptops have hardware switches which influence that behavior
2013-06-04 21:36:03	nUbee	kernel mode settings?
2013-06-04 21:36:07	kini	(i.e. screen drawing without reference to specific monitors - I assume)
2013-06-04 21:36:13	kini	nUbee: kernel mode setting, not settings :)
2013-06-04 21:36:42	mythmon	yeah.
2013-06-04 21:36:46	mythmon	do you know if you have it?
2013-06-04 21:39:00	nUbee	let check
2013-06-04 21:41:13	nUbee	it doesn't look like it
2013-06-04 21:41:32	nUbee	I only installed the fglrx and it's dependencies
2013-06-04 21:41:44	nUbee	maybe I should have installed xorg drivers as well?
2013-06-04 21:45:47	kini	you shouldn't need xorg drivers for virtual consoles to show up
2013-06-04 21:45:55	kini	you shouldn't need xorg at all for virtual consoles to show up
2013-06-04 21:46:57	mythmon	oh.
2013-06-04 21:47:05	mythmon	kms + fglrx = no, apparently.
2013-06-04 21:47:13	mythmon	at least, a year ago.
2013-06-04 21:47:38	 *	kini is happy with his highly supported-in-the-kernel intel graphics
2013-06-04 21:50:04	nUbee	kini: you are right
2013-06-04 21:50:32	nUbee	so, I tried looking more, some forum mentioned the program getty
2013-06-04 21:50:42	nUbee	it's referenced in /etc/inittab
2013-06-04 21:51:12	nUbee	tried running getty 38400 tty1 as root
2013-06-04 21:51:14	nUbee	didn't do anything

2013-06-05 00:01:02	kini	ever wanted to bail out of vim when editing a commit message for `git commit --amend`?
2013-06-05 00:01:02	kini	TIL about :cq
2013-06-05 00:01:37	TheShazbot	gotta git out of vim and git commit to emacs
2013-06-05 00:01:56	@krinkle	you can't just :q! when you --amend?
2013-06-05 00:02:39	kini	krinkle: no because that would leave the old commit message there, and it would accept it
2013-06-05 00:02:48	kini	I guess you could delete the commit message though
2013-06-05 00:02:52	kini	I didn't think of that lol
2013-06-05 00:03:11	kini	TheShazbot: emacs is the kind of editor you sort of keep open long term imo
2013-06-05 00:03:11	@krinkle	if you just git commit --amend again won't that override the old commit?
2013-06-05 00:03:25	kini	krinkle: yeah but what if you didn't want to amend at all?
2013-06-05 00:03:35	kini	i.e. you didn't want to change the commit date
2013-06-05 00:04:31	@krinkle	oh hrm

2013-06-05 09:48:37	KyleM	I would like to be a self employed programmer. Maybe making indie games with a small team. Do you think a CS degree from PSU would be appropreaite
2013-06-05 09:49:12	KyleM	appropriate
2013-06-05 09:50:18	nUbee	you dont need a degree to be a good programmer, nor to start your own business
2013-06-05 09:50:36	nUbee	however, networking is useful here
2013-06-05 09:51:09	KyleM	what do you mean by here?
2013-06-05 09:51:30	nUbee	going into the cs program, you're going to be meeting people
2013-06-05 09:51:39	KyleM	Ah
2013-06-05 09:51:47	nUbee	people who work for companies, or people who share similar goals
2013-06-05 09:52:07	nUbee	and you can learn valuable lessons from them
2013-06-05 09:52:27	KyleM	Yes, I need that too. I have been trying to make myself a good programmer for a very long time. I think its really the math course I need to go through to make myself better.
2013-06-05 09:52:40	KyleM	courses*
2013-06-05 09:52:50	nUbee	cs at psu is very math oriented
2013-06-05 09:53:04	@cbeck	Snnrrk
2013-06-05 09:53:20	@cbeck	Not really, not nearly as much as at better schools
2013-06-05 09:53:55	@cbeck	The math oriented classes are just the ones that usually kick people's butts
2013-06-05 09:54:13	KyleM	I'm at PCC right now taking math 95 and for the first time was able to use some mathematics in my programming. It was great.
2013-06-05 09:54:32	@cbeck	If you ask me, the benefit of a CS degree is essentially being forced to learn parts of CS you wouldn't seek out
2013-06-05 09:54:44	KyleM	yes, exactly
2013-06-05 09:54:50	@cbeck	So that down the road when you run into similar problems, you know where to start
2013-06-05 10:09:48	clarkb	open CLRS, thank York for punishing you, solve all the things
2013-06-05 10:12:30	@cbeck	Hurts your brain so good
2013-06-05 10:27:47	dcolish	turns out that shit matters
2013-06-05 10:28:33	clarkb	CLRS is the book I have right next to my desk
2013-06-05 10:28:53	clarkb	I have a bunch of other books on the shelf but CLRS is right there. Currently under a pile of stuff but still there
2013-06-05 10:28:55	dcolish	yeah, its a good monitor stand too
2013-06-05 10:29:01	dcolish	right height
2013-06-05 10:29:11	dcolish	so is the art of computer programming
2013-06-05 10:29:20	@cbeck	Also great for beating muggers
2013-06-05 10:29:25	dcolish	srsly
2013-06-05 10:30:13	clarkb	I bought a used copy years ago and part of the binding is in bad shape. I am now imagining the previous owner beating muggers with it
2013-06-05 10:30:19	KyleM	dd default block size 512 really sucks to transfer to a usb drive

2013-06-05 10:35:17	KyleM	shouldn't I be able to dd if=/OSinstallfile.iso of=/dev/disk1s1 ?
2013-06-05 10:37:23	dcolish	is that a raw block device or a parition?
2013-06-05 10:37:33	dcolish	i forget the naming scheme on osx
2013-06-05 10:37:44	KyleM	partition
2013-06-05 10:37:46	KyleM	hmm
2013-06-05 10:37:52	dcolish	you want the block device
2013-06-05 10:38:12	KyleM	right, thanks of=/dev/disk1
2013-06-05 10:40:56	KyleM	I wonder. Macs don't come with a OS install disk/usb drive. If accidentally set of=/dev/disk0 and screwed myself how would I fix my computer
2013-06-05 10:41:30	KyleM	I know there is a repair partition but I've never used it
2013-06-05 10:41:30	dcolish	take it to the mac store
2013-06-05 10:42:12	retrov	KyleM: if you open the Mac App store app, you can download an installer of the OS. inside of that is a DMG that you can use to make a DVD/USB drive from

2013-06-05 10:43:09	retrov	i made one and keep it in my desk
2013-06-05 10:43:58	retrov	you'll need at least an 8gb drive. the DMG is just over 4gb, IIRC
2013-06-05 10:44:01	KyleM	Thanks, I will definitely have to do that.
2013-06-05 10:45:31	clarkb	does no one else find that a little weird?
2013-06-05 10:45:50	clarkb	just boot off the minimal install of $distro that you can download at any time :)
2013-06-05 10:46:31	retrov	it is strange. IIRC, the recovery partition can download an installer of the OS, but i don't want to depend on having a fast internet connection
2013-06-05 10:47:40	dcolish	they used to package a usb key with a new system
2013-06-05 10:51:00	KyleM	this is kind of stupid. I can't get the mountain lion installer because I haven't bought mountain lion, yet I'm using a computer running mountain lion right now.

2013-06-05 10:59:32	bkero	about 1/3rd to 1/2
2013-06-05 10:59:46	bkero	I didn't even have to ask
2013-06-05 11:00:18	KyleM	I actually like my insurance now because of the $5000 medical per person I have. I figured if I get in an accident on a bike I'm going to need an ambulance. $5000 should cover an ambulance at least
2013-06-05 11:00:42	bkero	medical coverage is required on oregon insurance
2013-06-05 11:00:54	bkero	I think the minimum is $60k

2013-06-05 11:05:44	clarkb	also the lack of driving record in this country
2013-06-05 11:05:48	bkero	I was paying $60/month for my 1991 Toyota MR2 Turbo. It went up to $74/month after my "incident"
2013-06-05 11:06:04	clarkb	was that under a parents plan?
2013-06-05 11:06:05	bkero	clarkb: are we talking full coverage or simple liability?
2013-06-05 11:06:11	bkero	Nope, just me. I've never had insurance through my parents.
2013-06-05 11:06:17	clarkb	that was the minimum that Oregon required at the time
2013-06-05 11:06:19	clarkb	~2005
2013-06-05 11:06:25	clarkb	its like liability+

2013-06-05 11:07:21	bkero	I was using Progressive at the time, which turned out to be more expensive than Geico. So I switched that.
2013-06-05 11:07:43	bkero	Now I'm paying $140/month for full coverage for my 2012 sports car. :P
2013-06-05 11:08:00	pilgrimd	ouch
2013-06-05 11:08:21	bkero	Yeah. I'm hopefully going to pay off the car soon so I can get cheaper insurance.
2013-06-05 11:08:32	zacharyp	I'm paying ~70 a month for a 2002 beetle, a 2012 outback, and two drivers
2013-06-05 11:08:38	zacharyp	yea for being old =P
2013-06-05 11:08:50	bkero	I could 1) pay off car and have insurance go from $140/month to $60ish/month, or 2) pay off ~65% of my student loans.
2013-06-05 11:09:33	pilgrimd	pay off car, that debt affects your credit rating more, then put the $80 into the loans.
2013-06-05 11:10:02	bkero	car is 3% interest, student is 6.5%
2013-06-05 11:10:09	@cbeck	Too lazy to find source, but the NPRs said the gender disparity for youngin's auto insurance has mostly disappeared due to women being more likely to text and drive

2013-06-05 11:10:38	bkero	Auto debt is actuall good consumer debt. It's value is rated on 1) never missing payments, 2) magnitude of the loan, and 3) payback length

2013-06-05 11:51:53	zacharyp	the article seems to indicate that as well
2013-06-05 11:52:55	kini	lol smbc++
2013-06-05 11:53:06	zacharyp	if jumping off is an impulsive act during the depths of sorrow, then a fence may just prevent the attempt long enough to come out of those depths
2013-06-05 11:56:43	TheShazbot	sometimes there isn't a comeback out of those depths
2013-06-05 11:57:52	@cbeck	TheShazbot: Armchair psychiatry fits you poorly
2013-06-05 11:59:07	TheShazbot	not really armchair psychiatry, I've felt these things, and understand the mindset
2013-06-05 11:59:26	TheShazbot	why make it more difficult for people.
2013-06-05 12:02:42	kini	by that logic, why do so few jurisdictions allow assisted suicide
2013-06-05 12:03:16	TheShazbot	because their draconian mindset doesn't allow people to take their own lives or those of others
2013-06-05 12:07:08	TheShazbot	if it's pointless, and you're just coasting
2013-06-05 12:07:11	TheShazbot	and unhappy
2013-06-05 12:07:21	TheShazbot	why not let people just end it all without consequence
2013-06-05 12:16:18	pfaffle	i think the reason is because we don't believe that: 11:56:43 TheShazbot | sometimes there isn't a comeback out of those depths
2013-06-05 12:16:56	pfaffle	and therefore making a very permanent decision when you're in a very bad frame of mind to make those kinds of decisions is not good
2013-06-05 12:32:40	@cbeck	Especially given that many suicides are actually on the upswing out of a depressive episode
2013-06-05 12:32:56	MaddHatter	the problem is that it's not "without consequences"
2013-06-05 12:33:38	MaddHatter	I see nothing against assisted suicide, but jumping from bridges in public places shouldn't be the preferred method
2013-06-05 12:34:01	MaddHatter	on the other hand, in typical Oregonian style, calling a historical, inanimate object a "killing machine" is a bit over the top, too
2013-06-05 12:35:48	Kraytul	TheShazbot: unless you've actually tried to kill yourself, you haven't been there.  It's not a good idea to spitball about what makes a difference.
2013-06-05 12:36:22	MaddHatter	I've heard a number of anecdotes about would-be suicides foiled by a net at their bridge of choice
2013-06-05 12:36:53	Kraytul	The deciding factors can be what many people would consider amazingly small things.
2013-06-05 12:38:09	MaddHatter	I don't like the fence idea for aesthetic reasons, but a net would (I think) be somewhat less of an eyesore
2013-06-05 12:38:34	MaddHatter	plus nets don't ruin photography off the bridge like a fence would, too
2013-06-05 12:39:32	kini	well
2013-06-05 12:39:55	kini	you might even say you haven't been there unless you've actually killed yourself

2013-06-05 12:45:30	Kraytul	Read hyperboleandahalf about depression... often times suicide isn't just about a demand for death, but the apathy of life or death.  Something like a barrier to it being as easy as hopping a small wall makes the barrier require real effort to cross.
2013-06-05 12:46:23	Kraytul	When confronted with a barrier, apathy trends to non-action.
2013-06-05 12:46:47	TheShazbot	I will concede that point
2013-06-05 12:46:53	Kraytul	A fence wouldn't stop someone who was hell-bent, but it would make it hard enough someone would have to really WANT to do it, rather than it be a passing notion that gets accepted.

2013-06-05 14:22:06	pilgrimd	What you *can*, do, though it have separate Roth and 401(k) accounts and roll over the 401(k) into the Roth in an advantageous tax year.
2013-06-05 14:22:32	Kraytul	Or hire an accountant++
2013-06-05 14:24:11	retrov	pilgrimd: yeah, keeping track of the pre- and post tax funds seemed like it would be a nightmare, which is why i was skeptical of Roth 401ks
2013-06-05 14:24:24	retrov	but the separate accounts/rollover thing seems like a good way around that
2013-06-05 14:24:45	retrov	as long as you get lucky with the tax year
2013-06-05 14:24:47	pilgrimd	retrov: The real advantage is that you can put away post-tax money, but still get an ERM.  But you can do the same thing with two accounts.
2013-06-05 14:24:55	retrov	ERM?
2013-06-05 14:25:00	pilgrimd	employer match.
2013-06-05 14:25:02	retrov	ah
2013-06-05 14:25:14	pilgrimd	ERM is the common abbreviation on payroll journals.
2013-06-05 14:25:34	 *	retrov just ofund out from our HR person that they are lookin at setting up 401ks, but don't know if they will match anything
2013-06-05 14:25:57	retrov	i'd also be bummed if the funds they had available to pick from were crummy
2013-06-05 14:26:10	retrov	as many mutual funds are
2013-06-05 14:26:39	greghaynes	^ this
2013-06-05 14:26:53	greghaynes	story of pretty much all 401ks
2013-06-05 14:27:12	retrov	if the fund was crummy or had so-so returns but with high fees, i'd stick to my Roth IRA and index funds after the employer match was exhausted
2013-06-05 14:27:39	pilgrimd	you can ask for a copy of the portfolio.
2013-06-05 14:27:48	pilgrimd	or just ask they leave your funds in a money market.
2013-06-05 14:27:58	greghaynes	pretty much everything does like >1% expr
2013-06-05 14:28:04	greghaynes	which is such friggin bs
2013-06-05 14:28:09	clarkb	I just let wheover manage it
2013-06-05 14:28:14	retrov	i know, i meant that i would ask them befor ethey set it all up, so they pick good funds
2013-06-05 14:28:21	retrov	or leave the field wide open to pick your own
2013-06-05 14:28:36	clarkb	fidelity that is what they are called
2013-06-05 14:28:44	 *	bkero has fidelity
2013-06-05 14:28:48	retrov	there's actually a fair number of DIY brokerages
2013-06-05 14:28:52	retrov	my roth IRA is at fidelity
2013-06-05 14:29:30	retrov	i'd prefer it if our employer set up the 401k there and let us pick from any of the funds you can buy through fidelity (even other brokerage's funds, fidelity only charges you $8)
2013-06-05 14:29:50	greghaynes	the fund also charges expr
2013-06-05 14:30:07	greghaynes	which will end up being a ton more than $8 :p
2013-06-05 14:30:24	bkero	Fund? Charges? wat.
2013-06-05 14:30:30	retrov	greghaynes: the vangard index funds i bought through fidelity are ~0.1-0.2% for fees
2013-06-05 14:30:30	bkero	Load fees? Load fees are for chumps.
2013-06-05 14:30:42	greghaynes	yea, thats not bad
2013-06-05 14:30:51	greghaynes	they are like the only ones :(
2013-06-05 14:30:56	retrov	(index funds)++
2013-06-05 14:32:00	 *	bkero has a pretty diverse fidelity portfolio for his 401k stuff.
2013-06-05 14:32:34	bkero	There's not really a lack of funds that don't charge fees
2013-06-05 14:32:49	greghaynes	you should look again at them
2013-06-05 14:33:06	 *	retrov has VBK, VTI and DVY
2013-06-05 14:33:09	bkero	I am :)
2013-06-05 14:34:22	clarkb	I have $17 in fees YTD
2013-06-05 14:34:54	greghaynes	expr musnt show up in that then
2013-06-05 14:35:35	greghaynes	this stuff is so rage inducing
2013-06-05 14:35:36	clarkb	I have employee contributions, employer contributions, fees, party money rows
2013-06-05 14:35:49	clarkb	so yeah $17
2013-06-05 14:36:10	clarkb	but I am also using their special managed portfolio thing
2013-06-05 14:36:15	greghaynes	the math doesnt add up for that to be true
2013-06-05 14:37:06	greghaynes	well, it actually does make sense that it wouldnt be listed as a 'fee'
2013-06-05 14:37:15	retrov	greghaynes: expr?
2013-06-05 14:37:25	greghaynes	expense ratio
2013-06-05 14:37:27	retrov	ah
2013-06-05 14:37:50	greghaynes	to really figure it out you gotta bust out dat compund interest table
2013-06-05 14:37:54	retrov	heh
2013-06-05 14:38:04	retrov	actually, you just have to watch Frontline on PBS :)
2013-06-05 14:38:12	greghaynes	oshi
2013-06-05 14:38:23	retrov	then you'll assume they're all going to rob you blind without any calculations needed >:)
2013-06-05 14:38:35	greghaynes	eh, thats probably a better assumption
2013-06-05 14:38:52	retrov	greghaynes: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement-gamble/
2013-06-05 14:39:15	greghaynes	wow pbs looks different
2013-06-05 14:39:27	clarkb	I am apparently 90% stock because I am young. wouldn't be hard to rob me blind
2013-06-05 14:39:30	bkero	greghaynes: FUSVX, FSMVX, MACGX, BSCFX, FSCRX, FEMKX, FIGRX, FSITX. None have any load fees.
2013-06-05 14:39:40	zacharyp	401k just seem like a big ponzi scheme to me
2013-06-05 14:39:43	greghaynes	load fee is different
2013-06-05 14:39:55	bkero	greghaynes: I originally said load fees. :P
2013-06-05 14:40:14	retrov	greghaynes: they did a show on the retirement system in general a few years back, but this one is more up to date and focuses more on how the 401k and mutual fund industry sucks tons of money out, especeially through expense ratios and fees
2013-06-05 14:40:39	retrov	IIRC, it's not so much fidelity, charles schwab, etrade, etc. themselves
2013-06-05 14:40:53	retrov	but the brokers in between them and you or your company
2013-06-05 14:41:38	greghaynes	its one of those things that you learn about when you actually go through the math, they are exponential functions so flat fees are all meh
2013-06-05 14:41:42	greghaynes	in comparison
2013-06-05 14:42:04	retrov	yeah
2013-06-05 14:42:13	retrov	that's why i don't really mind the $8 fees for buying and selling
2013-06-05 14:42:27	retrov	if the funds sthemselves have low expors
2013-06-05 14:42:31	retrov	exprs*
2013-06-05 14:42:39	retrov	holy shit,
2013-06-05 14:42:44	pilgrimd	retrov: that's a big reason for the Roth.  That few percent your employer contributes will likely disappear, if not even more.
2013-06-05 14:42:52	retrov	VTI: 0.05% VBK: 0.10%
2013-06-05 14:42:55	pilgrimd	And with a Roth, you can own it yourself and contribute manually.
2013-06-05 14:45:01	Kraytul	I have my roth with Vanguard, low expr
2013-06-05 14:46:01	pilgrimd	I have a SIMPLE with TD Ameritrade and a Roth with WFA.  The SIMPLE has better returns and no trading fees.
2013-06-05 14:46:04	bkero	Vanguard is $10k buy-in, yeah?
2013-06-05 14:47:03	greghaynes	ugh, should be working not watching pbs
2013-06-05 14:47:05	greghaynes	:p
2013-06-05 14:47:20	Kraytul	bkero: oh I dont' remember... might have been yeah.
2013-06-05 14:47:38	zacharyp	greghaynes: I has questions at work ;)
2013-06-05 14:47:39	Kraytul	I did 2012 & 2013 at the same time for max Roth and that flew with them :D

2013-06-05 14:52:14	greghaynes	sparta is in the name at least
2013-06-05 14:52:23	bkero	Which is like an index of all manner of diverse war machines the US gov't buys
2013-06-05 14:52:42	greghaynes	the ol' spartan index
2013-06-05 14:53:15	zacharyp	this. is. Sparta ... index
2013-06-05 14:55:53	greghaynes	I think its very obvious this channel is mostly full of people who recently graduated and started working rather than students
2013-06-05 14:57:04	@cbeck	What are you talkin' about? Students love retirement planning
2013-06-05 14:57:08	bkero	greghaynes: want to have a party where we smoke cigars and light them with $100 bills?

2013-06-05 15:01:07	bkero	They are
2013-06-05 15:01:15	clarkb	its practical decadence. you get to motor around lake union in a boat in a jacuzzi
2013-06-05 15:06:50	jesusaurus	bkero: what if we put the jacuzzi boat in our yachts pool?

2013-06-05 15:09:12	greghaynes	:)
2013-06-05 15:15:14	+askore	alevar: wikipedia says that python uses timsort.
2013-06-05 15:16:03	Corbin	askore: Indeed it does. Where did this conversation start?
2013-06-05 15:17:03	+askore	heh for the project in algorithms & complexity I'm implementing a few sorting algorithms and alevar wondered what sort algorithm python used.
2013-06-05 15:17:30	nightfly	Tim seems a little vain
2013-06-05 15:17:31	Corbin	Ah. Have you read Tim Peters' explanation yet?
2013-06-05 15:17:37	nightfly	"timsort"
2013-06-05 15:17:44	Corbin	It's a merge sort with a very *very* clever optimization.
2013-06-05 15:17:46	+askore	nightfly: haha yeah a little
2013-06-05 15:17:52	Corbin	nightfly: He's earned it.
2013-06-05 15:17:59	+askore	Corbin: I tried but I didn't really understand it.
2013-06-05 15:19:16	Corbin	askore: http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Objects/listsort.txt
2013-06-05 15:19:59	Corbin	askore: Do you know how mergesort works?
2013-06-05 15:20:23	+askore	I hope I do after implementing it :P
2013-06-05 15:20:43	zacharyp	I believe Java uses mergesort, quicksort, or insertion sort based upon the data type
2013-06-05 15:21:22	greghaynes	it randomly picks a sorting algo and then does bogosort for maximum randomness
2013-06-05 15:21:29	Corbin	Okay. So, timsort's big idea is this: When trying to find the merge point, if you have a big thing of data that is sorted WRT itself, try to "gallop" ahead and find a point far away in the current sequence to merge, rather than checking each item one-at-a-time.
2013-06-05 15:21:30	jesusaurus	greghaynes++
2013-06-05 15:21:30	zacharyp	I would hope that all modern languages with sort builtin will have a optimized sort of some sort
2013-06-05 15:21:48	dcolish	greghaynes: it actually sends the data to yermom and has her sort it
2013-06-05 15:21:49	nibalizer	Corbin: hey
2013-06-05 15:21:54	nibalizer	my gmail dont work the way i want it to
2013-06-05 15:21:56	zacharyp	momsort
2013-06-05 15:22:01	greghaynes	not a bad fallback routine
2013-06-05 15:22:09	Corbin	This is optimized for two kinds of data: Those with very expensive comparisons, and those which are largely already sorted.
2013-06-05 15:22:17	nibalizer	i.e. there is a particular contact in my ghangouts list that i just want to delete
2013-06-05 15:22:21	nibalizer	how do
2013-06-05 15:22:28	Corbin	Turns out that Python's comparisons dominate the overhead of sorting, and data tends to have patterns in it naturally.
2013-06-05 15:22:36	Corbin	nibalizer: No idea; I haven't opted in yet.
2013-06-05 15:22:50	Corbin	Or been converted. Or whatever. I don't even know what ghangouts is.
2013-06-05 15:23:39	nibalizer	well its like
2013-06-05 15:23:42	nibalizer	there used to be gchat
2013-06-05 15:23:44	Corbin	askore: Anyway, this is popular in languages where objects are spendy to compare. Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.
2013-06-05 15:23:47	nibalizer	but then they upgraded it or somet shit
2013-06-05 15:24:00	Corbin	askore: I'd just read the notes I linked from Tim; they're quite enlightening, if dense.
2013-06-05 15:24:06	Corbin	nibalizer: Huh. Annoying.
2013-06-05 15:24:19	+askore	Corbin: I will do that thing, after I finish the report on this stuff that's due tomorrow. :)
2013-06-05 15:24:29	Corbin	askore: Mm. Homework. :c
2013-06-05 15:24:32	+askore	yup
2013-06-05 15:24:48	clarkb	I started skimming it and was wondering when there would be pseudocode explaining the algorithm and couldn't find it
2013-06-05 15:25:09	clarkb	I suppose they just put all of the detail into what is different than normal mergesort
2013-06-05 15:25:14	clarkb	and it became dense
2013-06-05 15:26:53	Corbin	Yeah, if you're not familiar with mergesort then it could be a tough read.
2013-06-05 15:34:31	+alevar	Corbin: The Wikipedia page on Timsort is better. Pretty pictures and such.
2013-06-05 15:35:11	+alevar	IIRC, it uses multiple optimizations besides the one you explained.
2013-06-05 15:36:09	Corbin	alevar: It uses some *really* good guesses, yes.
2013-06-05 15:36:26	Corbin	I felt that WP's page was a little...light.

2013-06-06 01:27:49	kini	why on earth is vim taking literally minutes to run :g/^\s*$/d on a file with <10k lines
2013-06-06 01:28:05	kini	is this some peculiarity of the windows build
2013-06-06 01:28:40	MaddHatter	do \s\+ and it'll be much faster
2013-06-06 01:29:09	MaddHatter	it's not unique to windows, it's unique to how REs work, at least with PCRE, and likewise with boost::re and a few others
2013-06-06 01:29:58	MaddHatter	you'd think it would take advantage of the anchor, but the code doesn't seem to have a special-case for that
2013-06-06 01:30:38	kini	jesus, that was instantaneous
2013-06-06 01:30:56	kini	but the other half, :g/^$/d , is still taking a long time
2013-06-06 01:31:02	kini	surely that should be even more trivial
2013-06-06 01:31:12	MaddHatter	I got nothing on that one
2013-06-06 01:31:51	MaddHatter	maybe :v/./d or whatever the equivalent inverse would be?

2013-06-06 20:57:05	pilgrimd	dirname is standard, except on Linux, where it may or may not exist because someone in Tuvalu wrote a better version using a sorfleblat algorithm $commiter just read about and got all squishy over.

2013-06-06 21:48:22	+alevar	I never wear them because bike + fedora = fail
2013-06-06 21:48:58	+alevar	Also, it's difficult to get a good mix of clothing that works with a fedora. Easy to go wrong.
2013-06-06 21:54:30	TheShazbot	easy way to fix that
2013-06-06 21:54:34	TheShazbot	is to not wear a fedora

2013-06-07 12:59:55	Corbin	I don't have a multimeter that can put up with a car battery.
2013-06-07 13:00:10	bkero	Corbin: It's just 12v :)
2013-06-07 13:00:22	Corbin	bkero: And enough wattage to knock my socks off. :3
2013-06-07 13:00:36	bkero	Corbin: You're not measuring wattage though, or else you'd be right.
2013-06-07 13:00:49	bkero	Corbin: You can measure it from your cigarette lighter if it'll make you feel any safer :P

2013-06-07 14:45:37	pilgrimd	Corbin: It's really quite safe, but you can wear medical gloves if it'll make you feel better.  the voltmeter, even a cheap one, uses megohm resistance.  12 would produce at most a few dozen microamps.

2013-06-07 18:47:13	pilgrimd	The description doesn't give a format
2013-06-07 18:48:20	Wren	So it can be however you want, basically?
2013-06-07 18:48:24	pilgrimd	Neither does the instructions.
2013-06-07 18:48:51	pilgrimd	The resumes had full-block and modified-block examples in the text. I used a format that differed from both.
2013-06-07 18:49:06	pilgrimd	But is still essential a modified block format.
2013-06-07 18:49:22	pilgrimd	I used a full block format for the cover letter.
2013-06-07 18:49:44	pilgrimd	Well, hmm... full block in terms of header bits, but the paragraphs weren't jusified.

2013-06-08 21:14:33	kini	but here comes one from PSU D:
2013-06-08 21:38:37	pilgrimd	My fav was one where the "timely warning" was sent a good four days after the incident.
2013-06-08 21:39:12	kini	hah

2013-06-09 00:21:52	kini	female student assaulted in neuberger elevator at 4 pm on a saturday, hit back, attacker ran away
2013-06-09 00:22:09	kini	er, "a saturday" meaning today
2013-06-09 00:22:14	kini	er. yesterday, now, I guess
2013-06-09 00:22:58	kini	the suspect has been described as "a WM approximately 6'1 medium build, green eyes, well groomed with a shiny bald head, wearing a straw safari hat with a chin strap, olive green cargo shorts, a gray shirt, carrying a black bag"
2013-06-09 00:23:29	kini	I like how they don't elaborate on what "WM" is an abbreviation for
2013-06-09 00:23:36	kini	probably standard police report jargon lol
2013-06-09 00:23:51	Corbin	"white male"

2013-06-09 00:25:29	kini	kinda surprising for that to happen on a saturday afternoon
2013-06-09 00:25:51	kini	iirc, previous such reports were often at weird times like 3 am on a wednesday or something

2013-06-09 13:33:11	bkero	SQLAlchemy: ORM or Expression Language?
2013-06-09 13:36:47	dcolish	depends
2013-06-09 13:37:00	dcolish	if you're doing simple mappings ORM is good enough
2013-06-09 13:37:11	dcolish	if you want absolute control, expression language
2013-06-09 13:37:22	dcolish	my advice, start with ORM
2013-06-09 13:37:27	dcolish	dont do crazy joins
2013-06-09 13:42:11	bkero	Will ORM allo me to optionally specify data types for efficiency?
2013-06-09 13:42:16	bkero	Like char(40)s
2013-06-09 13:43:21	dcolish	yes
2013-06-09 13:43:49	dcolish	you're going to want to use a mapper directly
2013-06-09 13:44:11	bkero	Wha tdoes 'use a mapper directly' mean?
2013-06-09 13:45:22	dcolish	http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/orm/mapper_config.html
2013-06-09 13:45:43	dcolish	the declarative stuff is too much abstraction and always fails sooner or later
2013-06-09 13:46:58	bkero	Yeah, just interested in using sqlalchemy for some query optimization and database independence, I don't like magic ORMs very much
2013-06-09 13:47:41	dcolish	well whats nice is that you can get the ORM to do all the simple shit for accessing and build in some simple type mapping into you DAL
2013-06-09 13:47:56	dcolish	then if its too stupid to do the right thing you can just use the expression language
2013-06-09 13:48:04	dcolish	its always too stupid sooner or later
2013-06-09 13:49:39	bkero	I'm just using it to rewrite some crappy little old hg hook that pushes to/reads from a sqlite database. Being shared over NFS.
2013-06-09 13:50:57	dcolish	yeah, i mean the ORM's nice but you can just use the expression language if its pretty simple.
2013-06-09 13:51:09	dcolish	really the builtin sqlite client should be sufficient for that
2013-06-09 13:51:22	bkero	I'm trying to make it not sqlite :P
2013-06-09 13:51:38	dcolish	ah
2013-06-09 13:55:09	dcolish	if it was my project, i'd use the Table class for the schema and add a mapper once you needed any sort of domain logic
2013-06-09 13:55:31	@cbeck	TheShazbot--
2013-06-09 13:55:41	dcolish	you can talk to Table directly with the most expression language syntax
2013-06-09 13:56:17	dcolish	the Mapper class is what links a Table to the orm
2013-06-09 13:56:19	bkero	Table seems pretty straighforward, yeah.
2013-06-09 13:56:33	dcolish	so Table is the highlevel bit of the expression language
2013-06-09 13:56:38	dcolish	and Mapper is the bridge
2013-06-09 13:56:44	bkero	Ah, Mapper(User, user)
2013-06-09 13:57:27	bkero	dcolish: So using that I have to define the python class AND the Table definition, then Mapper() them together, yes?
2013-06-09 13:57:41	dcolish	yes, thats if you want to use models
2013-06-09 13:57:49	dcolish	but you can just use Table on its own
2013-06-09 13:58:01	dcolish	until you find that you want models
2013-06-09 13:58:12	dcolish	since it doesnt sound like you really need the right now
2013-06-09 13:58:24	bkero	Yeah, I don't really care about models
2013-06-09 13:58:39	bkero	More abstraction = more complicated = more magic = more :(
2013-06-09 13:58:51	dcolish	yeah, it is nice in a large application although

2013-06-09 15:31:04	+alevar	Any word on how many people there were?
2013-06-09 15:31:13	bkero	I drove back from Corvallis at 8:00, got there around 10:15, thought I was going to miss everything.

2013-06-09 17:59:20	kini	but it doesn't happen first, since that's a postfix increment :P
2013-06-09 17:59:41	kini	it's just parsed deeper in
2013-06-09 17:59:45	kini	ah, C++
2013-06-09 18:00:50	pilgrimd	kini: in C++ all four incr/decr operators happen before pointer magick
2013-06-09 18:03:07	kini	so if I set a[0] = 0 and a[1] = 1, then *a++ == 1?
2013-06-09 18:05:04	pilgrimd	Heh, exam question on finals week.  Umm... I think you'll get a sefault for trying to deref a point with an address of 1.
2013-06-09 18:05:28	kini	what
2013-06-09 18:05:46	kini	what pointer has address 1
2013-06-09 18:05:55	pilgrimd	a++ should get you a[1], which is 1, which you then try to deref.
2013-06-09 18:06:20	kini	how would a++ get you a[1]
2013-06-09 18:06:22	pilgrimd	if a[1] has a valid memory address in it, that'll work, but an address of 1 is in kernel space, so you get a segfault.
2013-06-09 18:06:24	kini	are you saying that a = a[0]?
2013-06-09 18:06:44	pilgrimd	This is why I hate using ++ to index arrays. :)
2013-06-09 18:07:12	kini	this is making no sense
2013-06-09 18:07:26	pilgrimd	a == a[].  ++ against an array essentially advances the start of the array to the next element.
2013-06-09 18:07:37	pilgrimd	sorry, a == a[0]
2013-06-09 18:07:56	pilgrimd	Someone please speak up and confirm I've not gone all stupid. :)

2013-06-09 18:15:09	pilgrimd	kini: the variable that references an array is more like a pointer to the first element.  you can increment and decrement it to move along the array.
2013-06-09 18:15:44	pilgrimd	the obvious problem, of course, is that you need something else pointing to the whole array or you can leak memory (only a problem with dynamic allocation)
2013-06-09 18:17:32	pilgrimd	So like in a hashing algorithm, you can do: hash(unsigned char *str) { int hash; int c; while (c = *str++) { // magic goes here } return hash; }
2013-06-09 18:18:42	pilgrimd	It's just a shortcut for 'for (i=0; i<arraylen; ++i) { //magic goes here }.  The ass-end of the compiler, if optimizing, will generally produce the same either way.  If not optimizing, *str++ is faster.
2013-06-09 18:22:12	kini	pilgrimd: http://ideone.com/vVa7nN
2013-06-09 18:23:00	kini	as you can see, the ++ is not applied to any of the values in the array, which means that *b++ is interpreted as *(b++), but you can also see that *(b++) evaluates to 0, which is the value at memory location b, not at memory location b+1
2013-06-09 18:23:15	kini	which is what I meant by saying that in *b++, ++ "happens" after *, but is parsed deeper than *
2013-06-09 18:23:41	pilgrimd	No, the ++ happens first, but is applied to the pointer to the array, not any of the array members.
2013-06-09 18:23:51	pilgrimd	If a = a[0], then a++ = a[1].
2013-06-09 18:24:03	kini	if the ++ happened first, then the * would be applied to 0xbfe357ac, which would be the new value of b
2013-06-09 18:24:09	pilgrimd	And a subsequent a++ will be == a[2].
2013-06-09 18:24:12	kini	it is in fact not, as you can see from the output
2013-06-09 18:24:20	kini	a++ does not equal a[1], and a does not equal a[0]
2013-06-09 18:26:11	david	a++ is a compile-time error because a is not an lvalue
2013-06-09 18:26:12	pilgrimd	*b++ in that output == b+1 == &a[1], which is what I said.
2013-06-09 18:26:29	kini	david: indeed, haha
2013-06-09 18:27:02	pilgrimd	ah wait no, it's a[0], postfix increment.
2013-06-09 18:27:06	kini	pilgrimd, those cannot be equal, they're not even of the same type
2013-06-09 18:27:06	kini	*b++ is of type int while b+1 is of type int*
2013-06-09 18:27:13	pilgrimd	lack of output indexing
2013-06-09 18:27:35	pilgrimd	*b++ outputs a[0], then bumps b to point to a[1].
2013-06-09 18:27:43	kini	yes, exactly
2013-06-09 18:27:50	kini	which means that the ++ happens after the *
2013-06-09 18:28:03	pilgrimd	No, it still happens first.
2013-06-09 18:28:14	pilgrimd	postfix incr/decr returns the old value, not the new one.
2013-06-09 18:28:42	pilgrimd	compare *(b++) to *(++b)
2013-06-09 18:29:47	kini	I don't see the distinction between "increments and returns the old value" and "returns the value and then increments"
2013-06-09 18:32:13	kini	bbl
2013-06-09 18:35:12	pilgrimd	Because it's: retrieve old value, copy to a temp register, increment old value, deref the temp register.
2013-06-09 18:35:32	pilgrimd	Some of that may or may not happen through a memory access instead of all in registers, but that's the order of operations.

2013-06-09 20:55:42	bkero	(Yeah I know it's Oasis, roar roar, but) the animation and imagery is much better.
2013-06-09 21:08:19	nightfly	Funimations really bad about that. I waited months for the new One Piece opening to come out and they are still using the last one on their new subs...
2013-06-09 21:10:58	bkero	Corbin: Dennou Coil is totally an anime about Google Glass. Everybody wears them.

2013-06-09 22:17:21	Wren	I usually find subtitles frustrating, but not as much as bad voice acting.
2013-06-09 22:17:42	kini	speaking of darker than black

2013-06-09 22:25:44	sectoidman	I'd also recommend ヨコハマ買い出し紀行 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kiko)
2013-06-09 22:26:01	+alevar	I'm contemplating doing something involving the Alaska Ferry (aka Alaska Marine Highway System) in September. Is anyone interested in going with me?
2013-06-09 22:26:04	pilgrimd	Wren: I'd rather have overdubs as well.
2013-06-09 22:26:12	+alevar	I'm just floating the idea at this point.
2013-06-09 22:26:17	+alevar	No pun intended
2013-06-09 22:26:31	Wren	"Something", Like a bike ride?
2013-06-09 22:26:52	+alevar	On a boat?
2013-06-09 22:27:03	Wren	I thought you meant like what badger did.
2013-06-09 22:27:23	Wren	Do a bike tour that involves a ferry ride
2013-06-09 22:27:29	Wren	s/badger/bajr/
2013-06-09 22:29:47	bajr	alevar: potentially, depends what you have in mind
2013-06-09 22:32:29	+alevar	I'm not exactly sure yet.
2013-06-09 22:32:49	+alevar	I'd like to do some sort of a trip in September, but I'm not sure what.
2013-06-09 22:33:00	bkero	alevar: Ride out to Bend?
2013-06-09 22:33:11	+alevar	That would be interesting.
2013-06-09 22:33:11	Wren	If I'm free then I might be interested.
2013-06-09 22:33:36	Wren	I do want to go on a bike tour at some point.
2013-06-09 22:33:47	+alevar	bkero: I'd need to train a bit.
2013-06-09 22:34:12	bkero	alevar: Want to do Banks -> Vernonia one of these weekends?
2013-06-09 22:34:17	bkero	i have some coworkers who want in on that too.
2013-06-09 22:34:31	Wren	bkero: Could I join you?
2013-06-09 22:34:42	bkero	Wren: Shouldn't be a problem.
2013-06-09 22:34:43	Wren	I've done that run before. It's pretty nice.
2013-06-09 22:34:50	bkero	I think there's a bus that heads out there.
2013-06-09 22:34:59	Wren	Not trimet
2013-06-09 22:35:07	Wren	So we have to make sure it carries bikes.
2013-06-09 22:35:14	bkero	It does.
2013-06-09 22:35:23	Wren	ok
2013-06-09 22:35:31	bkero	alevar, Wren: The trail looks like this. http://static.urbantimes.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Banks-Vernonia-trail-bike-bridge-640x480.jpg
2013-06-09 22:35:56	Wren	The trestle is really amazing when you get out on it.
2013-06-09 22:36:49	+alevar	bkero: That would be interesting, though I'm looking for a multi-day thing.
2013-06-09 22:37:07	bkero	alevar: These things aren't mutually exclusive.
2013-06-09 22:37:13	+alevar	yup
2013-06-09 22:37:16	bkero	Banks -> Vernonia would be a decent ramp-up.
2013-06-09 22:37:18	bkero	bajr: ^
2013-06-09 22:37:29	bkero	The longest journey I've done on a bike is...40 miles?
2013-06-09 22:37:34	bkero	Probably closer to 30.
2013-06-09 22:37:57	+alevar	Hmmmmmm, looks like it'll take me longer to get to banks
2013-06-09 22:38:01	+alevar	Like, waaaay longer
2013-06-09 22:38:04	bkero	:P
2013-06-09 22:38:07	bkero	You could take the bus there.
2013-06-09 22:38:08	Wren	I was thinking it would be interesting to bike Portland-Vernonia, camp out at Vernonia Lake, and then bike home the next day.
2013-06-09 22:38:17	Wren	About 50 miles each day
2013-06-09 22:38:28	bajr	so long as it's paved the whole way, I'm game
2013-06-09 22:38:44	Wren	bajr: it is.
2013-06-09 22:38:49	bkero	There are some cool roads out to Cottage Grove and I have a relationship with Sake One brewery out there.
2013-06-09 22:38:49	+alevar	Yeah... I wouldn't want to do biking w/o pavement.
2013-06-09 22:38:55	Wren	They finished surfacing it a couple years ago.
2013-06-09 22:38:56	 *	bajr has done this.
2013-06-09 22:38:57	+alevar	My bike is not good for that.
2013-06-09 22:38:58	bkero	I ride a road bike, non-paved is a no go for me.
2013-06-09 22:39:21	bajr	It is *not* pleasant unless you have a proper bike for offroading
2013-06-09 22:39:49	bkero	bajr: It's pleasant after you hit the first two wineries. ;)
2013-06-09 22:39:59	pilgrimd	Or a road bike with a set of trail rims and tires.
2013-06-09 22:40:45	bajr	bkero: yeah, right until the bumpy roads fuck your knees and give you a flat >.>
2013-06-09 22:40:46	 *	bkero is too lazy/out of shape, can't sacrifice rolling efficiency.
2013-06-09 22:41:02	bkero	bajr: get a more comfy saddle :)
2013-06-09 22:41:11	bkero	and steel
2013-06-09 22:41:14	bajr	you mean a mountain bike :D
2013-06-09 22:41:20	bajr	...
2013-06-09 22:41:25	 *	bajr suspects bkero of trolling
2013-06-09 22:41:29	bajr	steel makes it worse
2013-06-09 22:41:34	bajr	the rigidness
2013-06-09 22:41:43	bkero	Brooks makes some nice saddles and steel acts as a natural dampener. It flexes under those stresses.
2013-06-09 22:41:53	pilgrimd	steel would be more flexible than a typical road bike frame.
2013-06-09 22:42:03	bkero	The ride of a suspensionless aluminum bike is much worse than steel.
2013-06-09 22:42:28	bajr	yeah, I'll forgo that and just do it in a mountain bike if I'm offroading at all
2013-06-09 22:43:00	bajr	I did enough roadbike offroading in BC.
2013-06-09 22:43:05	pilgrimd	A mountain bike with continuous center-tread tires is not too bad for rolling resistance.  Particularly if you have high-pressure tubes.
2013-06-09 22:43:18	bkero	The weight
2013-06-09 22:43:38	Wren	A ride to Bend would be pretty intense just due to the Cascades.
2013-06-09 22:43:46	bajr	can't have it both ways bkero :/
2013-06-09 22:43:50	pilgrimd	Isn't that the point?
2013-06-09 22:43:51	bajr	how I wish it were so
2013-06-09 22:44:05	bajr	is what the point?
2013-06-09 22:44:20	pilgrimd	the intensity (for a trip like Portland<->Bend)
2013-06-09 22:44:21	bkero	bajr: Yeah. My consolation has been to have wide 700cs with tread on the sides, then deflate to have those points hit the ground when rolling over shitty gravel.
2013-06-09 22:44:43	bkero	alevar: Eugene would be a multiday.
2013-06-09 22:44:57	pilgrimd	Portland to Tillamook?
2013-06-09 22:45:06	bajr	bkero: that would probably make it a bit better, but then flats are still a serious problem
2013-06-09 22:45:13	+alevar	"On the Internet, only the NSA knows you're a dog"
2013-06-09 22:45:21	bajr	Hey guys, we should do CAT to OSUOSL
2013-06-09 22:46:16	+alevar	That would be... interesting.
2013-06-09 22:46:42	bajr	we would need a place to stay the night
2013-06-09 22:46:42	Wren	ooh.
2013-06-09 22:46:51	bkero	There are places we can crash.
2013-06-09 22:47:03	bajr	bkero: do you know folks who have yardspac- oh awesome
2013-06-09 22:47:03	pilgrimd	Just sleep outside on the OSU campus.
2013-06-09 22:47:05	+alevar	Lance's backyard!
2013-06-09 22:47:13	bkero	There's a park we could camp in near OSU actually..
2013-06-09 22:47:28	bkero	edunham: ^
2013-06-09 22:47:36	+alevar	Wouldn't we get in trouble? Or is it for camping?
2013-06-09 22:47:44	bkero	We might get yelled at, but no punishment.
2013-06-09 22:47:54	edunham	bkero: good question! there also might or might not be couches, depending on where i end up next year
2013-06-09 22:48:16	bajr	edunham: how about yardspace? one of us could pack a tent
2013-06-09 22:48:29	 *	bkero has camping suppliez
2013-06-09 22:48:31	bkero	nrrfktlclhvbdnjfujnchcktktvrkbij
2013-06-09 22:48:38	edunham	heh, there'll absolutely be yard space where i hope i'll end up living
2013-06-09 22:48:59	bajr	schweet
2013-06-09 22:49:03	bajr	so guys, when can we do this?
2013-06-09 22:49:14	 *	bkero is free three weekends from now
2013-06-09 22:49:24	Wren	I'm free forever.
2013-06-09 22:49:30	bajr	weekend of june 30th?
2013-06-09 22:49:38	bkero	Next weekend is california/montana, weekend after that is the other.
2013-06-09 22:50:21	bkero	I need to figure out my pack weight and get some shift linkage on my bike.
2013-06-09 22:50:57	 *	bajr should probably do some work on his bike...
2013-06-09 22:51:29	Wren	I need to replace my cassette and chain
2013-06-09 22:51:37	Wren	And possibly my rear wheel.
2013-06-09 22:52:23	+alevar	hmmm
2013-06-09 22:52:31	+alevar	I'm not sure what my availability will be.
2013-06-09 22:55:28	bkero	banks->vernonia is an easy day trip, why I suggested
2013-06-09 22:56:38	bkero	Google sez it'll take 9 hours to hit Corvallis from my house.
2013-06-09 22:56:42	bkero	95.5 miles
2013-06-09 22:56:53	bkero	That'd be a fucking _LONG_ day.
2013-06-09 22:57:14	Epitrope	bkero: https://youtu.be/7j0NDGJVROI was really cool, thanks for sharing it last week
2013-06-09 22:57:43	bkero	Epitrope: That man is a gigantic jackass, but he does know his shit.
2013-06-09 22:57:58	Epitrope	bkero: really? he came across really well
2013-06-09 22:58:40	bkero	Epitrope: He's a huge political player. Operational Security started doing a security audit on his build infra and found some really bad shit. Solution? Opsec is no longer allowed to audit the build network.
2013-06-09 22:59:04	Epitrope	ugh
2013-06-09 22:59:05	bkero	The last two people who held my position quiet because of pressure from him. I'll be doing the same.
2013-06-09 22:59:16	bajr	bkero: pack light
2013-06-09 22:59:31	bajr	yeah, it would be about 8-10 hours of non-stop riding
2013-06-09 23:00:06	bkero	bajr: water pack, rain cover, some homemade energy bars, a light, helmet
2013-06-09 23:00:22	bkero	should be < 4lb
2013-06-09 23:00:30	bajr	depending on weather, you could probably do without the rain cover
2013-06-09 23:00:48	bajr	but you'll definitely want to bring a spare tire or two
2013-06-09 23:00:51	bkero	Do you think the weather is that dependable?
2013-06-09 23:01:04	bajr	bkero: for oregon summer, yeah
2013-06-09 23:02:12	bajr	so long as we take a look at the weather report for the day
2013-06-09 23:02:32	bkero	2lb of antihistamines
2013-06-09 23:02:59	bajr	first aid kit
2013-06-09 23:03:09	bkero	duct tape and alcohol
2013-06-09 23:03:25	bkero	!s/alcohol/whiskey/
2013-06-09 23:03:32	bajr	s/whiskey/everclear/
2013-06-09 23:03:54	bajr	good for disinfecting and campfires
2013-06-09 23:04:18	pilgrimd	alcohol wipes are good for that.  sealed, light, single use.
2013-06-09 23:04:28	bkero	but are only single purpose
2013-06-09 23:04:31	bkero	whiskey is dual purpose
2013-06-09 23:04:47	pilgrimd	no, disinfect, fuel, let dry and use as napkin.
2013-06-09 23:05:17	 *	bajr still votes everclear.
2013-06-09 23:05:30	bkero	Everclear requires a license to buy in Oregon IIRC. :/
2013-06-09 23:05:36	 *	pilgrimd votes for not carrying bottles of liquid.
2013-06-09 23:05:41	bajr	???
2013-06-09 23:05:50	bajr	they didn't ask for my license...
2013-06-09 23:06:00	pilgrimd	bkero: You can buy it at liquor stores.
2013-06-09 23:06:11	pilgrimd	Or do you mean medical-grade ethanol?
2013-06-09 23:06:21	bkero	pilgrimd: A, must just be washington then.
2013-06-09 23:06:24	bkero	jesusaurus: confirm ^
2013-06-09 23:06:29	bajr	define medical grade... everclear's pretty pure stuff
2013-06-09 23:06:42	bajr	(as pure as you can get with a fractionating distiller)
2013-06-09 23:06:53	pilgrimd	bajr: you can buy 98+% ethanol "solutions" as a medical supply.
2013-06-09 23:06:57	bajr	aha
2013-06-09 23:07:21	bajr	i'll settle for 95%
2013-06-09 23:07:33	pilgrimd	ethanol's hydrophilia makes it impossible to get pure, but 98% might as well be pure.
2013-06-09 23:07:46	pilgrimd	hygrophilia?
2013-06-09 23:08:48	retrov	you actually don't want it that pure
2013-06-09 23:09:01	bajr	retrov: what happens?
2013-06-09 23:09:06	bajr	bursts into flames spontaneously?
2013-06-09 23:09:16	retrov	70% is most effective at disinfection. theory is that the alcohol disrupts membranes
2013-06-09 23:09:26	bkero	Heh, "disrupt"
2013-06-09 23:09:34	retrov	and there's enough water left over in the 30% to rush in and burst the cells open
2013-06-09 23:09:48	retrov	bkero: fire works too :)
2013-06-09 23:09:54	pilgrimd	retrov: right, but ultra pure means you can dillute it down to whatever you need.
2013-06-09 23:14:24	MaddHatter	oh, is that why rubbing alcohol is always sold at 70%?
2013-06-09 23:14:43	MaddHatter	I'm usually more interested in it as a solvent, so the stronger the better
2013-06-09 23:15:03	retrov	MaddHatter: i think it may just be sold at 70% because of cost
2013-06-09 23:15:30	MaddHatter	retrov: why not 60% then?
2013-06-09 23:15:42	retrov	dunno
2013-06-09 23:16:08	retrov	grr, getting nerdn-sniped
2013-06-09 23:16:11	retrov	nerd*
2013-06-09 23:16:27	MaddHatter	(not having finals)++
2013-06-09 23:16:37	retrov	actually, i'm just studying for virology, so a disucssion about alcohol is relevant
2013-06-09 23:18:34	bkero	retrov: I've pushed regenesis on you before, right?
2013-06-09 23:19:10	retrov	don't think you have
2013-06-09 23:19:49	bkero	retrov: watch the first episode of this and let me know what you think. http://www.hulu.com/watch/27786#i0,p0,d0
2013-06-09 23:19:56	bkero	Wren: Still watching EotE?
2013-06-09 23:20:05	Wren	Not tonight
2013-06-09 23:20:15	Wren	But I will probably watch more.
2013-06-09 23:20:29	retrov	bkero: you sneaky devil, foisting a new TV series on me :)
2013-06-09 23:20:37	retrov	2 days before my final!
2013-06-09 23:20:53	bkero	retrov: It's hard science badassery.
2013-06-09 23:21:14	retrov	damn, i have to log in to watch it
2013-06-09 23:21:33	bkero	:(
2013-06-09 23:21:40	Wren	I'm also planning to watch GoT at some point. Anyone have episodes I can borrow?

2013-06-09 23:25:47	sectoidman	man, that's been pretty popular ever since they put up the little information station / rest area in banks
2013-06-09 23:26:20	sectoidman	It's always packed nice weekends
2013-06-09 23:26:36	sectoidman	the trailhead is also like 2 miles from my house, so
2013-06-09 23:26:48	sectoidman	or well
2013-06-09 23:27:04	sectoidman	I guess it's 2 miles from my parents house; I'm moving to lake oswego
2013-06-09 23:48:24	retrov	sigh...
2013-06-09 23:48:41	retrov	(street racing style modifications to cars, especially exhaust ones)--
2013-06-09 23:48:56	retrov	they rumble by my new place regularly
2013-06-09 23:49:02	retrov	it stopped being cool 10 years ago
2013-06-09 23:52:59	nightfly	it was never cool
2013-06-09 23:53:17	nightfly	wait, that's wrong...
2013-06-09 23:53:44	nightfly	It's always been annoying
2013-06-09 23:54:18	retrov	yeah, i erred
2013-06-09 23:54:22	nightfly	I took a nap earlier and feel like I never fully woke up
2013-06-09 23:57:58	retrov	that's why i won't take naps

2013-06-10 00:04:51	bkero	definitely not intended to be loud. sound of turbo > fartcan exhausr
2013-06-10 00:08:20	MaddHatter	I used to live on Broadway, and I still cannot get used to (or sleep through) Trimet buses starting
2013-06-10 00:09:52	bkero	I can't stand semi trucks passing through my neighborhood at 7am :/
2013-06-10 00:10:11	bkero	Well...I can if the window is closed, but if it's open it's unmanageable
2013-06-10 00:10:14	eidolon	MaddHatter: air start is the worst sound

2013-06-10 11:59:28	Kona	Interesting.
2013-06-10 11:59:31	kini	that looks sexpy
2013-06-10 11:59:40	greh	shrimpton++
2013-06-10 11:59:55	Kona	How is he at teaching 311?
2013-06-10 12:05:32	pilgrimd	Wren: Yeah I'm not even sure what I should say.  IMO such a memo wouldn't be written by a VP.  It would be written by HR or by Tim Seitz' boss.
2013-06-10 12:09:49	Wren	It's such a jump up from previous assignments too. The other ones were pretty straitforward "do this type of letter in this format" assignments.
2013-06-10 12:12:03	pilgrimd	Yeah, so much for "oh, I'll have three days to work on this."  now it's "crap, I only have three days to work on this."
2013-06-10 12:25:49	Wren	eeyup
2013-06-10 12:41:49	blkperl	Kona: pretty good, the tests are fair and make sense
2013-06-10 12:42:36	Kona	Ah, that's good.
2013-06-10 12:42:59	Kona	I only ever had him for 410, which was a challenge class, not a general requirement.
2013-06-10 12:44:27	greh	what is 410?
2013-06-10 12:44:33	Kraytul	Crypto?
2013-06-10 12:44:39	Kona	So I was curious how he would do teaching students who aren't necessarily specifically interested in the topic
2013-06-10 12:44:51	Kona	greh, 410 is a bunch of different topic classes
2013-06-10 12:45:07	Kona	The one I took was Counting, Probability, and Computing
2013-06-10 12:45:08	Kraytul	I know shrimpton teaches crypto as a 410, not sure what else.
2013-06-10 12:45:15	Kona	^ that
2013-06-10 12:45:23	greh	no its 485
2013-06-10 12:45:47	Kona	It might be its own course now, but I think ours was the last 'pilot' class
2013-06-10 12:46:09	Kona	Oh, no, Crypto is 485, I see.
2013-06-10 12:46:28	greh	yeah, I've heard the counting class is pretty good
2013-06-10 12:46:33	greh	they're changing the name for some reason
2013-06-10 12:46:45	Kona	so the math/statistics dept doesn't freak out
2013-06-10 12:46:50	Kona	(no, really)
2013-06-10 12:47:01	kini	lol what are they changing it to
2013-06-10 12:47:31	greh	so... why did they freak out about the name?
2013-06-10 12:48:54	Kona	Because you're not allowed to teach a class that overlaps too much with other departments.
2013-06-10 12:49:29	greh	... why?
2013-06-10 12:50:02	@cbeck	And obviously the important thing is the name
2013-06-10 12:50:37	Kona	Yeah, what if CS starts teaching statistics, and it's so much cooler because it's with computers that nobody wants to take it from the math dept?!
2013-06-10 12:50:53	greh	that would be wonderful
2013-06-10 12:50:56	greh	451 sucks
2013-06-10 12:51:01	greh	for everyone
2013-06-10 12:51:02	greh	even the prof
2013-06-10 12:51:42	Kona	Whatever the 200-level one is... is also terrible.
2013-06-10 12:52:17	Kona	And for some reason it's obvious that the book used for that wasn't written by a statistician, because the wording is off/inaccurate
2013-06-10 12:52:20	greh	its for the social sciences that require stats
2013-06-10 12:52:36	Kona	It's amazing that people struggle at that one
2013-06-10 12:52:51	Kona	I went every class so I could spend 2 hours on tumblr or whatever.
2013-06-10 12:55:15	greh	I never took the 200 one. How do you do stats without calculus?
2013-06-10 12:55:25	Kona	Calculators.
2013-06-10 12:55:27	bkero	greh: magic formulas
2013-06-10 12:55:34	Kona	Yeah, that too.
2013-06-10 12:55:51	bkero	like physics without calculus
2013-06-10 12:55:53	Kona	Don't worry! You don't have to memorize the magic formulas!
2013-06-10 12:56:00	greh	bkero: does that mean "memorize this and don't ask questions or try to understand"?
2013-06-10 12:56:10	bkero	greh: yup
2013-06-10 12:56:14	greh	stats--
2013-06-10 12:56:22	@cbeck	I first took stats without calc
2013-06-10 12:57:07	@cbeck	It was great, my calc didn't have all the magic formulas, so I had to figure out the calculus to do them
2013-06-10 12:57:22	greh	where did you take that class?
2013-06-10 12:57:30	@cbeck	Community college in CA
2013-06-10 12:58:04	greh	there we go
2013-06-10 13:00:40	bkero	Ah CC in CA was so cheap
2013-06-10 13:01:25	@cbeck	And this one at least was really high quality
2013-06-10 13:02:52	bkero	Mine was UCBC. University of California Behind Costco.
2013-06-10 13:02:57	bkero	(It really was behind a Costco)
2013-06-10 13:04:09	snarfel	Or...was the Costco behind it? Dun duin dun~!
2013-06-10 13:04:32	Kona	No, Costco is higher in the hierarchy than university
2013-06-10 13:04:52	bkero	It went Highway -> Costco -> UCBC -> Mountains
2013-06-10 13:04:58	Kona	Lemme know when we find the university *inside* Costco
2013-06-10 13:06:05	greh	you can get degrees in bulk
2013-06-10 13:06:30	pilgrimd	Hey, don't take Costco for granted.
2013-06-10 13:06:45	pilgrimd	Just making their pizza takes 450 degrees
2013-06-10 13:06:57	@cbeck	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2013-06-10 13:07:05	pilgrimd	I... I'll show myself out.
2013-06-10 13:07:43	TheShazbot	That was a good joke.
2013-06-10 13:10:51	+alevar	Kona: It's Stats 243 and 244.
2013-06-10 13:11:31	+alevar	My capstone group's project is an attempt to help stats 24(3|4) students
2013-06-10 13:11:42	pilgrimd	alevar: What are you doing for the capstone?
2013-06-10 13:11:45	+alevar	Study group organization web app
2013-06-10 13:12:03	pilgrimd	Oh interesting.
2013-06-10 13:12:27	+alevar	Not the most interesting to create, but there's a need. Stats 24(3|4) has a stunningly high drop/fail rate.

2013-06-10 13:12:48	Kona	pilgrimd++
2013-06-10 13:13:08	pilgrimd	That's mostly because the PSU math department doesn't believe STAT* course are "real math".
2013-06-10 13:14:26	pilgrimd	451 and 452 are the same way. :/
2013-06-10 13:15:35	Wren	By the way, in case you haven't seen it: http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/
2013-06-10 13:15:39	+alevar	I have heard rumors of some... non-ideal attitudes. Still, apparently someone in the math department is interested enough to fund the project.
2013-06-10 13:15:41	Wren	It's certainly...something.
2013-06-10 13:15:44	TheShazbot	thanks wren for that
2013-06-10 13:15:47	TheShazbot	I should buy a mac
2013-06-10 13:16:00	TheShazbot	and watch everyone's heads explode
2013-06-10 13:16:11	Wren	What better one to start with than one that resembles a trash can?
2013-06-10 13:16:19	+alevar	TheShazbot: They can run Linux, so they're okay.
2013-06-10 13:16:39	bkero	alevar: how many do you know that run linux on their mac?
2013-06-10 13:16:42	pilgrimd	alevar: pretty much the wisdom I gained was take STATs from a math grad student.  they will at least hammer through the material efficiently and won't burden you with excessive homeworks.
2013-06-10 13:17:07	+alevar	bkero: and...
2013-06-10 13:17:09	@cbeck	I almost wish I'd done that for my work laptop, my system-76 is meh at best
2013-06-10 13:17:10	greh	the grad students are really hit or miss though
2013-06-10 13:17:19	greh	some want to teach, some do it because they have to
2013-06-10 13:17:35	+alevar	I remember taking calc from a math education PhD student. That was awesome.
2013-06-10 13:17:36	 *	bkero can't think of any better than thinkpads.
2013-06-10 13:17:43	bkero	Zareason and System76 are both nice compal rebranders.
2013-06-10 13:17:54	+alevar	The guy simply loved teaching, and was quite good at it.
2013-06-10 13:18:34	@cbeck	bkero: It's ugly and heavy but feels anything but solid
2013-06-10 13:19:00	@cbeck	And driver wise it works about as well as any other linux lappy I've had

2013-06-10 13:29:45	TheShazbot	if I could make an osx VM on my i7 machine, I'd be fine
2013-06-10 13:30:42	bkero	Why can't you?
2013-06-10 13:31:18	TheShazbot	probably because I hasn't tried, massa
2013-06-10 13:31:32	mythmon	technically it is against the terms, but that is silly.
2013-06-10 13:31:38	TheShazbot	it wouldn't work on my phenom II for obvious reasons
2013-06-10 13:31:42	bkero	Yeah. Like anything worth doing, it's illegal.
2013-06-10 13:31:45	bkero	That's the only limitation.
2013-06-10 13:32:21	Corbin	I just tell people that I can't afford to have an Apple test machine.
2013-06-10 13:32:58	mythmon	Corbin: have you ever had someone offer to donate you one?
2013-06-10 13:33:17	bkero	mythmon: I don't think that'll solve his problem
2013-06-10 13:34:31	Corbin	mythmon: Nope! :3
2013-06-10 13:34:54	mythmon	bkero: it will solve the state problem.
2013-06-10 13:35:14	Corbin	My limitations are threefold. First, I don't know how to manage an Apple machine. Second, I can't afford one. Third, even if (1) and (2) were not problems, I'm still boycotting Apple, so I won't purchase one with my own funds out of principle.
2013-06-10 13:36:00	pilgrimd	Corbin: Buy PC, install OSX on it.
2013-06-10 13:36:21	kini	<Wren> By the way, in case you haven't seen it: http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/
2013-06-10 13:36:21	kini	that looks pretty cool
2013-06-10 13:36:21	kini	I bet it's going to be hella expensive though
2013-06-10 13:36:59	Wren	Well it is Apple.
2013-06-10 13:37:05	Corbin	pilgrimd: That won't actually help me support Apple platforms, though, because I won't be on actual Apple hardward.
2013-06-10 13:37:08	Corbin	*hardware even.
2013-06-10 13:37:21	TheShazbot	oh man
2013-06-10 13:37:35	TheShazbot	... I can't not want one of these if only for the performance of them
2013-06-10 13:37:41	TheShazbot	but do I need it? no
2013-06-10 13:37:43	pilgrimd	Corbin: But you can learn the OS.  The hardware is a moot point.  What is user servicable is no different from PC hardware.
2013-06-10 13:38:00	pilgrimd	Supporting Apple hardware = go to ifixit.com or apple store.
2013-06-10 13:39:04	kini	Wren: even if it weren't apple, that looks seriously high-end
2013-06-10 13:39:10	Corbin	pilgrimd: But that's like saying that I support Chrome because I've tested on Chromium. Just because things *should* be the same doesn't mean that they are.
2013-06-10 13:39:12	kini	like, ECC memory in a desktop lol
2013-06-10 13:39:29	Corbin	And when it comes to distributing open-source software, I prefer to not sugar-coat what I support.
2013-06-10 13:39:57	pilgrimd	Corbin: You would literally be running exactly the same OS on equivalent hardware.  The only difference is you didn't pay a 150% markup for some shiny bits and most of the silhouette of a piece of fruit.
2013-06-10 13:40:55	bkero	pilgrimd: and endorsing those who choose to live in software bondage
2013-06-10 13:40:59	Corbin	pilgrimd: I think that I'll stick with my current line, thanks.
2013-06-10 13:42:48	TheShazbot	wow.
2013-06-10 13:42:53	TheShazbot	I gotta say.
2013-06-10 13:43:13	TheShazbot	they have me excited about an apple product
2013-06-10 13:43:22	TheShazbot	because it's revolutionary.
2013-06-10 13:43:29	Corbin	TheShazbot: What's the product?
2013-06-10 13:43:41	bkero	TheShazbot: How's it revolutionary?
2013-06-10 13:43:43	retrov	TheShazbot: if you want a Mac desktop, do a hackintosh
2013-06-10 13:44:06	pilgrimd	bkero: It's revolutionary because of the amount of spin on it.
2013-06-10 13:44:17	@krinkle	looks super slick, but obnoxious to upgrade or repair
2013-06-10 13:44:25	bkero	krinkle: So exactly like a G4 Cube?
2013-06-10 13:44:39	@krinkle	exactly like most apple products
2013-06-10 13:44:39	nightfly	krinkle: repair? a modern apple product?
2013-06-10 13:44:51	TheShazbot	well
2013-06-10 13:45:01	pilgrimd	krinkle: repair? I think you mean just go to the apple store and buy another one, don't you?
2013-06-10 13:45:26	TheShazbot	it's flashy and is built fundamentally different from other comparable machines
2013-06-10 13:45:38	clarkb	what is this thing we are talking about?
2013-06-10 13:45:40	TheShazbot	an entirely different architecture from the usual "flat motherboard"
2013-06-10 13:45:43	Wren	I dunno, it might be easy enough to upgrade if the build the case right.
2013-06-10 13:45:50	Wren	clarkb: The new Mac Pro
2013-06-10 13:45:53	pilgrimd	TheShazbot: translation: it'll be awesome for about six months, then impossible to service or upgrade.
2013-06-10 13:46:05	TheShazbot	well
2013-06-10 13:46:08	pilgrimd	clarkb: http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/
2013-06-10 13:46:09	Wren	The current Mac Pro comes apart easily enough
2013-06-10 13:46:38	Corbin	It's a cylinder.
2013-06-10 13:46:48	Corbin	Hardly the most interesting case mod I've seen.
2013-06-10 13:46:53	clarkb	neat I think lian li has a tower case sort of like that
2013-06-10 13:47:14	retrov	xbox one for $500? eeek
2013-06-10 13:47:23	TheShazbot	Corbin: but are other machines cooled with just one conjoined heatsink?
2013-06-10 13:47:51	Corbin	TheShazbot: I have a Pi. It's cooled with *no* heatsinks.
2013-06-10 13:47:55	mythmon	Engadget: "At the center of the new Mac Pro is a 12-core, 256-bit Intel Xeon E5 pr".. wait what?
2013-06-10 13:47:55	TheShazbot	(if I was going to buy computer parts right now, I'd just buy another graphics card to throw in this ultrabay for the hell of it
2013-06-10 13:47:56	Corbin	SHOW ME YA MOVES
2013-06-10 13:48:01	mythmon	go home engadget, you're drunk.
2013-06-10 13:48:21	TheShazbot	a raspberry pi is probably less powerful than my cell phone :/
2013-06-10 13:48:52	Kraytul	haha mythmon
2013-06-10 13:48:57	Corbin	TheShazbot: You'd be surprised!
2013-06-10 13:49:05	Corbin	(Also my cell phones don't have heatsinks either.)
2013-06-10 13:49:18	Kraytul	Cellphone heatsyncs to your hand!!!!
2013-06-10 13:49:21	Corbin	My Beagle doesn't have a heat sink, and it's *exactly* the same board that's in my Galaxy.
2013-06-10 13:49:36	clarkb	Kraytul: and into your brain
2013-06-10 13:49:39	Corbin	Er, not my Galaxy, my old Droid 1.
2013-06-10 13:49:50	clarkb	Corbin: yeah its an OG Droid
2013-06-10 13:50:01	clarkb	but with more memory and higher clock iirc
2013-06-10 13:50:01	TheShazbot	so that was a bad analogy
2013-06-10 13:50:18	Kraytul	clarkb: mmm sweet sweet brainwarming
2013-06-10 13:50:20	TheShazbot	but I meant more of a "this thing has a lot of power, it needs something to cool it"
2013-06-10 13:51:27	Corbin	So what's the list price on this thing?
2013-06-10 13:52:01	TheShazbot	probably close to 7-8g's
2013-06-10 13:52:08	Corbin	I just want to know because I could have a 12-core Tower of Pi for $420 USD.
2013-06-10 13:52:23	Corbin	I could be putting together massively-parallel machines at home, for lulz, for a fraction of the cost.
2013-06-10 13:55:35	Corbin	And the Pi's the cruddy end of what's available. I'm imagining a tower of Bones or similar now. :3
2013-06-10 13:56:15	TheShazbot	how about a tower of optiplex gx280's
2013-06-10 13:56:27	mythmon	Corbin: price unannounced. so far it is deckware.
2013-06-10 13:57:17	Corbin	TheShazbot: I don't believe in GPGPU; you should still have a serious number of general-purpose serial CPUs for computation.
2013-06-10 13:57:21	clarkb	I just want new haswell laptops with high res displays that don't come from apple
2013-06-10 13:58:10	Corbin	Oh, before we have a flame war: *some* things can go on GPUs just fine, but not *everything*.
2013-06-10 13:58:15	TheShazbot	8 prescott pentium 4 2.8's
2013-06-10 13:58:26	TheShazbot	you wouldn't need to heat your house in the winter
2013-06-10 13:58:54	Corbin	There are more efficient heaters. How do you cool your place in the summer?
2013-06-10 13:59:07	 *	Corbin just finished scrapping the last of his Prescotts
2013-06-10 13:59:24	TheShazbot	um
2013-06-10 13:59:28	TheShazbot	I don't :/
2013-06-10 13:59:36	retrov	bkero: what does mozilla use for git/hg repo management and browsing (if you use such tools)? at my new job, we've been looking at gitlab, phabricator and a few other things, but it's complicated by the fact that we have an existing jira install
2013-06-10 13:59:43	bkero	retrov: gitolite
2013-06-10 13:59:49	Corbin	I'm a little jelly. My place is so warm.
2013-06-10 14:00:01	bkero	retrov: gitlab works but has no public repos
2013-06-10 14:00:05	bkero	or per-branch permissions
2013-06-10 14:00:25	mythmon	retrov: for my work at mozilla we use github.
2013-06-10 14:00:28	TheShazbot	I don't really have my two prescott machines on right now
2013-06-10 14:00:38	TheShazbot	haven't been doing anything cool
2013-06-10 14:00:46	retrov	bkero: do you have any web UI for repo browsing? what the devs here basically wanted was something where they could past in a web link to a commit into a jira ticket for an issue
2013-06-10 14:00:47	TheShazbot	just gaming or lamenting life
2013-06-10 14:01:00	retrov	s/past/paste
2013-06-10 14:02:16	bkero	retrov: gitolite and gitweb-caching, yeah
2013-06-10 14:02:58	clarkb	yeah we use gitweb and github for that
2013-06-10 15:22:21	bkero	Ahh yeah. Just downgraded to T-Mobile's new prepaid option. $30/month for 100 minutes, unlimited SMS, and 5GB data
2013-06-10 15:22:54	+alevar	100 minutes?
2013-06-10 15:24:01	clarkb	wow thats not bad
2013-06-10 15:24:07	bkero	Yep. I've used a total of 14 minutes this month.
2013-06-10 15:24:11	clarkb	considering how little phones seem to be used for calls anymore
2013-06-10 15:24:13	bkero	So 100 is way more than I need
2013-06-10 15:24:28	+alevar	ah
2013-06-10 15:24:40	+alevar	I definitely use a good chunk.
2013-06-10 15:25:03	mythmon	straight talk: unlimited calls/texts/data: $45/mo, prepaid.
2013-06-10 15:25:34	mythmon	runs on either AT&T or T-Mobile towers your choice (when you set it up)
2013-06-10 15:25:41	bkero	mythmon: 4g or 3g?
2013-06-10 15:25:49	mythmon	bkero: I don't have 4g.
2013-06-10 15:25:57	mythmon	I am not qualified to answer that question.
2013-06-10 15:26:03	bkero	mythmon: :( don't you have a Nexus 4?
2013-06-10 15:26:10	mythmon	bkero: exactly. :\
2013-06-10 15:26:17	bkero	How doesn't that have 4G?
2013-06-10 15:26:40	clarkb	it is only hsdpa+
2013-06-10 15:26:47	clarkb	with an lte radio that is disabled iirc
2013-06-10 15:26:54	bkero	4G isn't necessarily LTE
2013-06-10 15:27:07	mythmon	It does have the best thing you can get without being LTE.
2013-06-10 15:27:09	clarkb	correct but wimax and LTE are currently the only real 4G
2013-06-10 15:27:18	mythmon	and it has a LTE chip that doesn't work on any US networks (and is disabled)
2013-06-10 15:27:19	bkero	define 'real'
2013-06-10 15:27:26	mythmon	bkero: the only things advertised as 4g.
2013-06-10 15:27:48	bkero	4G is kind of a bullshit term anyway. It just means 4th generation. People change which wireless technologies belong to which generation all the time.
2013-06-10 15:27:54	mythmon	yeah.
2013-06-10 15:27:54	bkero	Originally EDGE was 3G. In Germany it still is.
2013-06-10 15:27:55	clarkb	bkero: as meeting the definition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G
2013-06-10 15:28:44	mythmon	to better answer the question: I get the best signal my phone knows how to do anything with.
2013-06-10 15:28:44	bkero	clarkb: AFAICT from the article it says 4G is 100mbit for high mobility or gigabit for relatively stationary
2013-06-10 15:29:20	mythmon	bkero: right. which is why, according to the standards body, none of the carriers are selling real 4g.
2013-06-10 15:29:42	mythmon	which goes to show how much power the standards body has.
2013-06-10 15:29:47	clarkb	heh
2013-06-10 15:30:04	clarkb	wimax and lte do have complaint implementation but no one is deploying it
2013-06-10 15:30:43	mythmon	carriers--
2013-06-10 15:30:45	clarkb	unless that was what the big fuss around the S4 was about
2013-06-10 15:30:49	bkero	In my brick office in downtown pdx I'm getting 15/70 on my $30/month plan.
2013-06-10 15:30:58	clarkb	the S4 has some new special radio sauce on verison
2013-06-10 15:31:22	mythmon	clarkb: oh really? I had not heard of that.
2013-06-10 15:31:35	clarkb	mythmon: yeah apparently they will be enabling it with a patch in the near future
2013-06-10 15:31:52	mythmon	odd
2013-06-10 15:32:04	mythmon	verizon won't give me a sim card phone though, so too bad.
2013-06-10 15:32:23	clarkb	mythmon: http://www.androidcentral.com/verizon-s-galaxy-s4-will-support-aws-lte-upcoming-software-update
2013-06-10 15:32:39	clarkb	mythmon: they will but only for the LTE radio
2013-06-10 15:32:48	clarkb	its weird
2013-06-10 15:34:54	+alevar	Does anyone have a favorite web-based chat room system? Like Campfire, but free?
2013-06-10 15:35:18	+alevar	Or IRC without the persistent session requirement.
2013-06-10 15:35:44	+alevar	I'm looking at something for my capstone group to have a chat room.
2013-06-10 15:36:09	clarkb	irc doesn't have a persistent session requirement, you just might miss things ;)
2013-06-10 15:39:52	dcolish	people like hipchat
2013-06-10 15:42:51	clarkb	ohgod no, no no no no no
2013-06-10 15:43:03	dcolish	hah
2013-06-10 15:43:04	dcolish	welp
2013-06-10 15:43:20	clarkb	it runs on adobe air
2013-06-10 15:43:29	clarkb	which automatically makes it insecure and useless
2013-06-10 15:43:38	dcolish	it has an irc gateway iirc
2013-06-10 15:43:43	dcolish	or xmpp
2013-06-10 15:43:45	dcolish	i forget
2013-06-10 15:43:52	clarkb	so you fall back on using xmpp so why not just use xmpp in the first place?
2013-06-10 15:43:58	dcolish	idk
2013-06-10 15:44:08	clarkb	its gateway stuff is really clunky
2013-06-10 15:44:10	dcolish	there was also flowdock which sucked for other reasons
2013-06-10 15:44:11	dcolish	eh
2013-06-10 15:44:13	dcolish	its fine
2013-06-10 15:45:41	@cbeck	finch had a great deal of hate for hipchat, but I don't remember details
2013-06-10 15:47:24	clarkb	its horrible
2013-06-10 15:47:46	finch	HISSSSSSSSS
2013-06-10 15:47:52	finch	SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
2013-06-10 15:48:01	finch	FUCK HIPCHAT RIGHT IN THE EAR
2013-06-10 15:48:34	TheShazbot	hipchat seems like a moniker for cschat
2013-06-10 15:48:59	finch	TheShazbot: imagine a chat client that periodically forgets to UPDATE
2013-06-10 15:49:03	finch	there are messages
2013-06-10 15:49:05	finch	going back and forth
2013-06-10 15:49:10	finch	and they aren't being displayed.
2013-06-10 15:49:13	Kona	broken-hip chat?
2013-06-10 15:49:33	finch	fit that shit-chat
2013-06-10 15:49:33	TheShazbot	so if Kona was using hipchat and I told her she was lovely, she might not see it?
2013-06-10 15:49:34	kini	psssst http://www.chatcrypt.com/
2013-06-10 15:49:44	finch	creepy...
2013-06-10 15:49:46	TheShazbot	seems like a great chat.
2013-06-10 15:50:05	TheShazbot	means I can be sarcastic and whatever
2013-06-10 15:50:11	Kona	Is that where chat goes to die?
2013-06-10 15:50:23	TheShazbot	probably.
2013-06-10 15:50:32	finch	that's where chat messages are sent that you really need to hear
2013-06-10 15:50:34	finch	but wait
2013-06-10 15:50:36	finch	fuck
2013-06-10 15:50:38	finch	shit

2013-06-10 15:59:10	finch	that sounds grand!
2013-06-10 15:59:17	+alevar	Kona: It's summer. Cardboard boxes aren't *that* uncomfortable.
2013-06-10 15:59:38	pilgrimd	Park benches are comfy if you bring a pillow.
2013-06-10 16:00:04	Kona	It will be September, though.
2013-06-10 16:00:15	+alevar	Still not too bad
2013-06-10 16:00:20	@cbeck	Make sure you get the wax treated cardboard, then
2013-06-10 16:00:23	Kona	May need a rainproof box
2013-06-10 16:00:24	+alevar	Might want to switch to something that doesn't get soggy
2013-06-10 16:00:25	Kona	Yeah
2013-06-10 16:00:46	pilgrimd	cbeck: Banana boxes, free house at your local grocer!

2013-06-10 17:12:16	pilgrimd	I do have a Canadian passport, though. :) It will make fleeing this country much easier.
2013-06-10 17:12:24	bkero	pilgrimd: You'd get to participate in the commonwealth games
2013-06-10 17:12:46	pilgrimd	bkero: And apply to work for the Commonwealth of Nations!
2013-06-10 17:13:13	bkero	and participate in the occupation and repression of nations that only the English are known for
2013-06-10 17:13:27	+alevar	pilgrimd: Would it be fair to say that there is more internal diversity within the US than there is a difference between the US and Canada as a whole?
2013-06-10 17:13:39	pilgrimd	Well... as a Canadian I'm disinclined to impose upon another country in so brash a manner.
2013-06-10 17:14:15	+alevar	I usually think of Canada and the US as sharing much of their culture.
2013-06-10 17:14:19	bkero	The one you declared fealty to isn't.
2013-06-10 17:14:44	pilgrimd	alevar: Not really, no.  Canada has a very high influx of people from the arabain, indian and asian subcontinents and there is a much stronger formation of exclusionary subcultures aligned to nationality.
2013-06-10 17:15:19	pilgrimd	And Canadian natives also have about three distinct cultures: western provinces, french canadians, and the far eastern provinces.
2013-06-10 17:15:28	bkero	pilgrimd: Only on the west coast, Toronto has different immigrants. How is that any different than Seattle, San Francisco, LA, or SD?
2013-06-10 17:15:43	pilgrimd	And a much, much stronger popular culture of good-natured derision between them.
2013-06-10 17:15:56	+alevar	pilgrimd: Hmmm, I didn't word my sentences very well.
2013-06-10 17:17:11	pilgrimd	alevar: No, I think I misread.
2013-06-10 17:18:00	pilgrimd	alevar: I don't think there is a single answer to that question.  There are parts of the US and Canada that clearly show vast cultural and national differences, other areas not so much.
2013-06-10 17:18:37	pilgrimd	The Canadian midwest matches a lot of northern US midwest culture.  BC (particularly Vancouver) has a lot in common with Seattle, Portland, and SF.

2013-06-10 23:07:57	bkero	Are woot shirts American Apparel?
2013-06-10 23:07:59	Kona	It's a serious concern. There are some trendy shirt printers whose fits are awful. I don't know how that happens, since they're all the same base shirts
2013-06-10 23:08:03	Kona	but it happens.
2013-06-10 23:08:39	 *	Kona side-eyes Look Human
2013-06-10 23:08:41	bkero	American Apparel are really hit-or-miss sizes. I got a FirefoxOS shirt earlier today from them. It's a medium. It is not fitted at all, just a tube. The tube is larger than several 'Large' sizes from them I have.

2013-06-10 23:09:45	sabreman	but now i'm gonna get a ps4
2013-06-10 23:09:46	kini	and now you are?
2013-06-10 23:09:52	bkero	sabreman: what convinced you to get a ps4?

2013-06-10 23:12:19	clarkb	but then I will have a reason to get one

2013-06-10 23:13:47	clarkb	bkero: ah yeah. uncharted 3 wasn't as good as 2
2013-06-10 23:13:48	Kona	bkero, shhh. Some ps3 having switching up to a ps4 is my only chance to play Ni no Kuni
2013-06-10 23:13:49	bkero	Cinematic tour de forces. Not games.
2013-06-10 23:14:01	bkero	Kona: ...why?
2013-06-10 23:14:25	retrov	Kona: there's no backwards compatibility, so i'm keeping my PS3

2013-06-10 23:15:01	clarkb	bkero: they are different but I really enjoyed them. particularly 2
2013-06-10 23:15:41	bkero	clarkb: I've gotten half way done with the first game. That wasn't too bad.
2013-06-10 23:15:56	bkero	The aiming/shooting mechanics were fucking horrible. Per FPS console games.
2013-06-10 23:18:32	clarkb	you need to play 2. They improved everything
2013-06-10 23:18:34	clarkb	so much fun
2013-06-10 23:18:47	bkero	Kona: Ni no Kuni is fantastic <3
2013-06-10 23:19:24	bkero	If nothing else it's a really beautiful game
2013-06-10 23:19:46	clarkb	I really need to actually play MGS4 but if you want to talk about cinematic tour de forces not games that game is the worst
2013-06-10 23:19:52	retrov	bkero: did you ever play Indigo Prophecy?
2013-06-10 23:19:59	clarkb	I think you have to sit through 45 minutes of cutscene before you can shoot anything
2013-06-10 23:20:05	Kona	bkero, cruel
2013-06-10 23:20:20	retrov	clarkb: the longest cust scene is actually towards the end
2013-06-10 23:20:29	bkero	retrov: I did. That game is just cruel.
2013-06-10 23:20:40	retrov	in hte beginning, it's more like 5-7 minutes, IIRC, until you have control
2013-06-10 23:20:42	bkero	Kona: Some of us were even more restless to play it than you were. ;)
2013-06-10 23:20:49	clarkb	retrov: yeah but it feels like forever.
2013-06-10 23:21:03	clarkb	retrov: I recently replayed mgs2 and mgs3 and even after than mgs4 felt over the top
2013-06-10 23:21:23	Kona	Yes, good, the shirt is mine.
2013-06-10 23:21:35	retrov	clarkb: really?

2013-06-10 23:22:07	bkero	retrov: That game completely passes the crate review system though.
2013-06-10 23:22:54	clarkb	retrov: I already own all of them but peace walker
2013-06-10 23:23:08	retrov	clarkb: i don't have metal gear 1 or 2
2013-06-10 23:23:23	retrov	i have 2 and 3, but the original PS2 versions, not the HD remakes
2013-06-10 23:23:29	bkero	retrov: http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/39.html
2013-06-10 23:23:36	clarkb	I unfortunately do not have originals just the remakes
2013-06-10 23:23:41	clarkb	they are decent remakes though
2013-06-10 23:23:46	bkero	"Start to Crate" metric. The smaller the StC, the worse the game.
2013-06-10 23:24:25	retrov	clarkb: how much do the HD versions improve over the originals?
2013-06-10 23:24:45	retrov	also, is the HD version of 3 the subsistence one? where you can use the right analog stick to move the camera around?
2013-06-10 23:25:17	clarkb	retrov: yes mgs3 HD is the fancy version
2013-06-10 23:25:53	clarkb	I wouldn't get the HD versions if I had the originals but they are a great way to play
2013-06-10 23:26:24	retrov	i think i'll wait until the legacy collection drops in price
2013-06-10 23:27:05	TheShazbot	I have mgs2/3 for ps2 if people want to borrow them, they sit in a box
2013-06-10 23:27:36	retrov	i liked 3 alot
2013-06-10 23:27:38	bkero	So lulz: "Kevin: This shot reminds me: You'll see games with forklifts and crates, but you won't see one goddamn pallet. You know what a pallet is right? Yeah, you worked at the warehouse, you know. But all these whiny bitches who go to college on their parents' money and then design games have never been inside a real fucking warehouse and have no fucking clue that in order to move a fucking crate, you
2013-06-10 23:27:40	bkero	need to have a goddamn pallet.  Hey Monolith, how'd that fucking box get in there?"

2013-06-10 23:29:30	clarkb	Delta Force 2!
2013-06-10 23:29:38	clarkb	that game was awesome
2013-06-10 23:29:47	bkero	clarkb: it was nine times better than Doom
2013-06-10 23:30:24	clarkb	using the LAW in that game made me happy
2013-06-10 23:30:31	bkero	Notes:  Crate usage is one of the classes in basic training.
2013-06-10 23:34:48	pilgrimd	My monitor has picture-in-picture!
2013-06-10 23:36:40	bkero	Aww, Deus Ex: Finally, a crate game for me, the thinking man.   You see all those options at the bottom?  Those are for strategy.  You're gonna have to do some sneaky shit to separate that crate from its health.
2013-06-10 23:39:32	Wren	OK, It seems like not that long ago I read about some manga series about the people in this endless sort of space station built continuously buy robots. And the main character is a guy. He's accompanied by an female android/cyborg who is constantly getting a new body. Ring any bells?
2013-06-10 23:49:32	Kona	No, but sounds interesting.
2013-06-10 23:54:05	Wren	It had kind of a weird name. Short, I think
2013-06-11 00:07:13	bkero	Wren: That could easily be an allegory for Galaxy Express 999, but probably not.
2013-06-11 00:07:31	Wren	I saw that when googling. Not it

2013-06-11 06:37:33	Kraytul	I mean to find something more to market in screens.
2013-06-11 06:37:52	bkero	Contrast, colors, 3d, high refresh rate

2013-06-11 06:38:04	bkero	racing stripes

2013-06-11 07:26:37	bkero	mythmon: Was thinking. There aren't very many weechat relay clients. Why not make a web-enabled one?

2013-06-11 07:58:47	mythmon	bkero: web based relay client: talk to Wraithan. Also, you can't do it purely in the browser with normal apis.
2013-06-11 07:59:18	bkero	mythmon: You'd need some kind of server backend. :P Expected.

2013-06-11 08:22:21	bkero	mythmon: that would be pretty useful :)
2013-06-11 08:22:26	bkero	Although that is beyond my programming ability I think.
2013-06-11 08:22:30	mythmon	Wraithan has talked about making it.
2013-06-11 08:22:43	bkero	Or rather I don't know if I'd want to spend time bit-twiddling and unpacking with Javascript.
2013-06-11 08:23:03	mythmon	the protocol doesn't require any bit twiddling.
2013-06-11 08:23:13	mythmon	it's all byte level stuff.
2013-06-11 08:23:13	bkero	Is it pretty easy to have javascript execute arbitrary tcp datastreams? That seems a bit sketchy. :P
2013-06-11 08:23:31	bkero	Sure, outgoing is ascii but incoming is binary
2013-06-11 08:23:45	mythmon	i know.
2013-06-11 08:23:54	mythmon	the incoming is binary, but never split smaller than a byte.
2013-06-11 08:24:03	mythmon	the smallest data type is an 8bit integer.
2013-06-11 08:24:20	bkero	iirc it's still packed together though
2013-06-11 08:24:27	mythmon	but at byte boundaries.
2013-06-11 08:24:47	mythmon	every thing you need to work with is a multiple of 8 bits in size.
2013-06-11 08:24:55	mythmon	trust me, I just implemented this a week ago.
2013-06-11 08:25:01	bkero	Ah, so more parsing and lexing and less bitwise extraction
2013-06-11 08:25:05	mythmon	yeah.
2013-06-11 08:25:44	 *	bkero needs to patch the weechat-android client to send notifications to his pebble watch.
2013-06-11 08:25:50	mythmon	that would be slick.
2013-06-11 08:26:04	mythmon	though in my experience, weechat-android doesn't like losing it's connection.
2013-06-11 08:26:06	bkero	Pretty easy too, it already sends notification intents
2013-06-11 08:26:16	mythmon	nice.
2013-06-11 08:26:21	bkero	No, it gets really pissed at that. I have tons of spam in buffer 1 and relay.relay.list about that.
2013-06-11 08:26:47	mythmon	I was thinking about getting Page to automatically clear relay.relay.list
2013-06-11 08:26:52	mythmon	purge, rather.

2013-06-11 11:58:34	mythmon	websockets is not arbitrary tcp sockets.
2013-06-11 11:58:44	bkero	mythmon: what is arbitrary tcp sockets?
2013-06-11 11:58:52	mythmon	bkero: ...arbitrary tcp sockets.
2013-06-11 11:59:06	MaddHatter	mythmon: yes, not arbitrary, but once you get through the setup, it basically is
2013-06-11 11:59:26	mythmon	MaddHatter: sure, but the other end has to understand the setup process.
2013-06-11 11:59:35	bkero	mythmon: Rephrased: Is there a javascript library to handle the connect(), read(), and write() of arbitrary TCP sockets?
2013-06-11 11:59:39	bkero	or maybe the listen()? O_o
2013-06-11 11:59:42	mythmon	bkero: yes.
2013-06-11 12:00:04	mythmon	it is part of the new JS apis that are part of the fxos push. you have to be a privileged app on fxos to use them.
2013-06-11 12:00:07	mythmon	so practically, no.
2013-06-11 12:00:26	bkero	mythmon: :( is that going to be posted back to desktop for things like webapps?
2013-06-11 12:00:36	mythmon	probably. I'm not sure.
2013-06-11 12:00:43	mythmon	maybe it already is if you have the right bits.
2013-06-11 12:00:45	mythmon	idk.

2013-06-11 12:01:44	mythmon	note that "privileged app" is a high barrier to entry.

2013-06-11 12:03:53	mythmon	bkero: um... I'm not sure.
2013-06-11 12:04:01	mythmon	maybe I'm getting things mixed up.
2013-06-11 12:04:14	mythmon	you at least have to be an installed app.
2013-06-11 12:04:14	bkero	Presumably it's analogous to a 'permission' in android
2013-06-11 12:04:18	mythmon	not just a webpage.

2013-06-11 12:06:40	MaddHatter	bkero: really? It didn't look like it from what I was reading.
2013-06-11 12:07:01	bkero	MaddHatter: It's DEFINITELY part of the platform. If you deploy FxOS phones at your company you can point them all at your company marketplace.
2013-06-11 12:07:07	MaddHatter	bkero: the way it seems to be described, by getting mozilla to sign your stuff
2013-06-11 12:07:14	mythmon	MaddHatter: I'm really not qualified to talk about this, but I think it is more like SSL.
2013-06-11 12:07:33	mythmon	it needs to be signed, and signed by someone you trust, but not necessarily a central agency.
2013-06-11 12:07:43	MaddHatter	that's a lot more reasonable, then
2013-06-11 12:08:13	bkero	Mozilla is the change you want to see in the world. :)
2013-06-11 12:08:30	MaddHatter	I'm not sure I agree with that, but I know that's how they see themselves
2013-06-11 12:08:53	mythmon	MaddHatter: while working on the inside, I am not sad about the direction things are going.
2013-06-11 12:09:00	mythmon	maybe unhappy about pacing, but not direction.

2013-06-11 15:25:44	clarkb	(its fine building packages for all the puppets on all the platforms is a pita I bet but want to make sure that this isn't going to change)
2013-06-11 15:35:40	haus	clarkb: f15, f16 are EOL, we have f17 builds
2013-06-11 15:36:24	haus	oh
2013-06-11 15:36:28	haus	i read that backwards
2013-06-11 15:36:42	haus	we don't rebuild old puppets for new OSes :)
2013-06-11 15:37:21	haus	clarkb: but running 2.7.x on f18 would be sort of crazy, it doesn't play well with ruby 1.9
2013-06-11 15:38:35	clarkb	I see
2013-06-11 15:41:03	clarkb	I don't know a whole lot about fedora18 but know puppet >= 2.7 is still supported so wanted to sort out why it wasn't available on fedora 18
2013-06-11 15:41:15	clarkb	if they only provide ruby 1.9 that would be an excellent reason
2013-06-11 15:46:13	clarkb	haus: apparently puppet 2.7.something is shipped by fedora

2013-06-11 20:44:11	MaddHatter	the answer to that letter is that your basic rights aren't being abused, because US citizens aren't targeted. And the first amendment does not (as the letter claims) protect anonymous assembly, and the USSC has even struck that assertion down before.
2013-06-11 20:45:48	bkero	someone want a box full of free sushi? i went to my usual place and he hooked me up with a big to-go box
2013-06-11 20:45:58	MaddHatter	bkero: what's your usual place?
2013-06-11 20:50:41	clarkb	anonymous assembly? aren't we talking about recording the location, date, duration, source and destination of phone calls? that isn't anonymous assembly
2013-06-11 20:50:48	clarkb	(among other things)

2013-06-11 21:11:08	MaddHatter	but it's also 9, and that means everything not already closed will be very soon
2013-06-11 21:12:00	MaddHatter	To put it in perspective, I'm pretty sure we have both more sushi and more hamburger restaurants than starbucks.

2013-06-11 21:16:15	clarkb	Prostitutes for God was really depressing

2013-06-11 21:59:15	clarkb	I can't come up with any reasonable reason for why you wouldnt be able to use BSD licensed code

2013-06-11 22:01:07	clarkb	not complaining about having a public domain alternative, but its odd that someone would complain about BSD

2013-06-11 22:05:26	clarkb	I don't care for the drama. I am genuinely curious what the reasons are. Perhaps my notions of what BSD licensing means are all wrong

2013-06-12 09:15:59	Corbin	IYSS.
2013-06-12 09:16:19	Corbin	Your best bet is to look at some IRC traffic and see if you can correlate that to the BNF.
2013-06-12 09:16:41	mythmon	KyleM: did you know that you can get irc clients for android? some of them are even pretty good.
2013-06-12 09:17:52	KyleM	thats what I did before. I just looked at irc protocol and wrote for it. mainly I split the string based on : and figured it out from there. But, I feel there is a much more efficient way to do it.

2013-06-12 09:19:08	greghaynes	clarkb: nice
2013-06-12 09:19:25	KyleM	efficient - less code that handles more, or "flexible"
2013-06-12 09:19:37	Corbin	mythmon: The standard rules for improving grammars apply. Note that you don't have to avoid left-recursion and sometimes a left-recursive rule is simpler than a right-recursive one.
2013-06-12 09:19:53	Corbin	KyleM: Give up. IRC is a tangle of semi-standards and corner cases.
2013-06-12 09:20:30	KyleM	Well, any good learn project ideas?
2013-06-12 09:20:40	KyleM	learning*
2013-06-12 09:20:48	Corbin	Oh, is that what this is about?
2013-06-12 09:20:57	Corbin	IRC's a horrible thing for learning. Cruddy cruddy protocol.
2013-06-12 09:21:21	KyleM	yeah, but for some reason I find making IRC bots way too much fun
2013-06-12 09:21:27	Corbin	Eh, then go for it.
2013-06-12 09:21:46	mythmon	KyleM: if you really want to make an irc client, i suggest using a library. I suggest either pyhton's twisted's client or node.js's node-irc.
2013-06-12 09:21:56	mythmon	depending on your choice of language.
2013-06-12 09:23:01	clarkb	twisteds lib cant do ipv6 properly unless supybot is actually broken and they blame twisted
2013-06-12 09:23:30	KyleM	I would like to learn bigger projects, like gwt. But, its really a lot to learn and with no direction its not one of the things I have successfully taught myself
2013-06-12 09:23:44	Corbin	twisted.names has issues with IPv6 lookups still, but you can totally connect to IPv6 addresses.
2013-06-12 09:23:45	mythmon	KyleM: i can't in good concious recommend you learn GWT.
2013-06-12 09:25:32	clarkb	corbin I think it is related to dns. basically supybot cant connect to freenode with twisted if it gets a AAAA from dns
2013-06-12 09:26:37	Corbin	clarkb: Hm, interesting.
2013-06-12 09:26:47	Corbin	clarkb: I should point out that supybot is a pile of flaming shit, BTW. :3
2013-06-12 09:27:07	Corbin	buildbot, hackabot, hamper, and WTF kenaan is, all manage to deal with Freenode successfully.
2013-06-12 09:27:15	clarkb	sure but people have written useful things atop it
2013-06-12 09:27:26	bkero	patch it to make it work with ipv6?
2013-06-12 09:27:53	clarkb	bkero I gave up after about half an hour of untangling twisted names
2013-06-12 09:28:05	bkero	put freenode in /etc/hosts?
2013-06-12 09:28:18	clarkb	I think I asked for guidamce here was pointed at mythmon and he was like good luck
2013-06-12 09:28:29	clarkb	bkero that is the wrong way of doing it
2013-06-12 09:28:45	KyleM	but, old school
2013-06-12 09:28:47	bkero	clarkb: ldpreload around gethostbyname() calls?
2013-06-12 09:29:01	clarkb	that is a slightly more awesome fix
2013-06-12 09:29:07	Corbin	Well, twisted.names is only the Twisted DNS *server*. Twisted resolves names through the reactor.
2013-06-12 09:29:13	clarkb	but twisted does ita own lookups iirc
2013-06-12 09:29:28	bkero	You've already discounted the good solutions, so all you're left with are bad ones. :P
2013-06-12 09:29:29	Corbin	It uses gethostbyname(). It just threads those so that they won't block.

2013-06-12 14:57:42	KyleM	why is a required internet connection for the xbox such a negative?
2013-06-12 14:57:57	KyleM	non of my electronics would be useful without internet
2013-06-12 14:58:06	clarkb	KyleM: because a lot of people live in situations where that is impractical
2013-06-12 14:58:23	KyleM	the last mile people?
2013-06-12 14:58:33	clarkb	eg living in other coutries with poor infrastructure, in a submarine, etc
2013-06-12 14:58:45	kini	there's another reason why that's a negative
2013-06-12 14:58:48	clarkb	also, what happens 10 years from now to all of those games you paid for
2013-06-12 14:58:49	Kraytul	The smart question is not "why is it bad?" but "why is it necessary"
2013-06-12 14:58:50	KyleM	are they going to have the same restrictions in those countries?
2013-06-12 14:58:53	Kraytul	as with law...
2013-06-12 14:58:55	kini	it's because it's an extra requirement that has no good reason behind it
2013-06-12 14:59:14	kini	if I want my device to be off the net I should be able to take it off the net
2013-06-12 14:59:19	sabreman	i don't know why
2013-06-12 14:59:21	clarkb	you can play NES games on your original hardware if you still have it. you won't be able to do that with the new xbox
2013-06-12 14:59:26	sabreman	but i just CAN NOT remebr when my timesheets are due
2013-06-12 14:59:29	sabreman	it's silly
2013-06-12 14:59:32	kini	sort of ties into the "does it watch you?" question
2013-06-12 14:59:40	Kraytul	Because you're not renting your xbox, you own it.
2013-06-12 15:00:05	bkero	KyleM: It's bad because it means if they take their service down your device is useless.
2013-06-12 15:00:16	david	devil's advocate: why don't people have these complaints about steam?
2013-06-12 15:00:18	bkero	KyleM: Imagine that the NES required an internet connection. Nintendo would have taken the servers it talked to down decades ago.
2013-06-12 15:00:21	KyleM	you own it, but you don't own the service. and now a days, the service is becoming as important as the product
2013-06-12 15:00:33	kini	david: do you need to be online to run a steam game?
2013-06-12 15:00:35	Kraytul	david: because you can disconnect steam from the net after installing your games and it still works 100%
2013-06-12 15:00:37	sabreman	david: becuase steam has a contingecy plan to let you download all your shit if that ever becomes a problem
2013-06-12 15:00:53	bkero	Steam does not require an internet connection.
2013-06-12 15:00:57	sabreman	^
2013-06-12 15:01:14	david	oh, ok. I didn't know
2013-06-12 15:01:27	bkero	I have complaints about steam for other reasons.
2013-06-12 15:01:41	bkero	If they cancel my account then all of the games I've purchased are taken away from me.
2013-06-12 15:01:49	bkero	I cannot gift games to my children
2013-06-12 15:01:56	bkero	I cannot sell games to my friends
2013-06-12 15:02:09	bkero	I am not allowed to take them to court over any dispute.
2013-06-12 15:02:19	bkero	I am bound by their own arbitration process.
2013-06-12 15:02:26	KyleM	I think microsoft really wants to get into the media business like apple got into the music business, and having a required internet connection insuring that all consoles will be update will be a huge leverage to get hollywood deals done
2013-06-12 15:02:31	kini	pirate games and send checks to the devs
2013-06-12 15:02:45	bkero	kini: I've done this before. It works.

2013-06-12 15:11:02	Kona	Humble Bundle still says DRM-free.
2013-06-12 15:12:15	Kona	for bundles and the weekly deals

2013-06-13 14:20:06	mythmon	well, i actually have a few sites that don't use a DB.
2013-06-13 14:21:59	+alevar	What would be a good HTTP code for when a request to a token validation server fails?
2013-06-13 14:22:16	+alevar	In this case, OIT's single sign-on system, which uses CAS.
2013-06-13 14:39:32	mythmon	alevar: so, you are an intermediary, and you need to say that one of your dependencies failed?
2013-06-13 14:40:12	mythmon	alevar: I suggest either 424 Failed Dependency, or 418 I'm a Teapot.
2013-06-13 14:41:24	Corbin	Yeah, predependencies are the right thing here.
2013-06-13 14:42:27	mythmon	technically 424 is part of the webdav standard, and says that the client did something wrong in a past request.
2013-06-13 14:42:37	mythmon	like, you have to ask for apples and then oranges, but you just jumped straight to oranges.

2013-06-13 14:50:26	nightfly	Isn't that server error?
2013-06-13 14:50:43	Corbin	It can be used to indicate that some backend behind the server has failed.
2013-06-13 14:51:36	Corbin	alevar: Is the user agent providing you with credentials which you are validating, or is the app's own credential the one that fails?
2013-06-13 14:54:17	+alevar	The former
2013-06-13 14:54:33	+alevar	er
2013-06-13 14:54:41	+alevar	I'm looking at two situations
2013-06-13 14:54:58	+alevar	1) The CAS server failing for some reason
2013-06-13 14:55:12	+alevar	2) An invalid token
2013-06-13 14:56:00	mythmon	did the token come from the user?
2013-06-13 14:56:35	+alevar	The CAS server hands a token to the user agent, which then hands the token to the app that I'm writing.
2013-06-13 14:56:47	+alevar	Then the app checks it with the CAS server
2013-06-13 14:56:49	mythmon	ah
2013-06-13 14:56:55	mythmon	that should be a 403, I think.

2013-06-13 21:58:45	pilgrimd	Wren: Is ok, I haven't started writing it either.  Been mulling a good three days now.  I'm thinking more of a rhetorical approach instead of just crawling up Tim's ass.
2013-06-13 22:12:02	Wren	I didn't actually spot too many grammar errors. And if Gill did indeed screw up in the way that Tim claims, there is reason to be upset.

2013-06-15 18:26:07	pilgrimd	I prefer doing a job that isn't industry related because it forces you to keep on your game and do real work yourself.  It makes you take the common knowledge and apply it to a uncommon scenario.  That is, you have to fucking think for a living.
2013-06-15 18:26:32	pilgrimd	It also means you don't have 175 asshats stopping by your desk everyday with the idea they know how to do your job for you.

2013-06-16 13:53:41	dondon	bkero: it's 1/2 mi from my place, and I'm out at PSU at 10am should I pick one up?
2013-06-16 13:53:59	bkero	dondon: PCH Cables is a half mile from your place?
2013-06-16 13:54:07	dondon	yeah
2013-06-16 13:54:09	bkero	It's way out in Hillsboro next to Intel's JF campus.

2013-06-16 14:01:30	bkero	dondon: I don't get this. RIght angle and left angle seem to both be the same thing. Maybe one of their images is flipped. http://www.pchcables.com/st1fomiusbca.html http://www.pchcables.com/3meusb20rian.html

2013-06-16 19:33:07	mythmon	aleph: i do some JS. I know little about frameworks, and I just read that article, and was quite interested.
2013-06-16 20:09:59	aleph	mythmon: Yeah, me too. The framework specific concepts were good <for me> to get some background. One thing I *think* he was saying that if your app is pretty simple then not much of what he was saying mattered.
2013-06-16 20:10:41	aleph	I.E. you don't *need* Angular if the app isn't large and need to be maintained
2013-06-16 20:13:16	mythmon	maybe.
2013-06-16 20:17:03	bkero	http://pastebin.com/TpuMDSjv
2013-06-16 20:17:25	mythmon	it sounded to me like he was arguing that emberjs was strictly better than angular.
2013-06-16 20:43:08	aleph	But his reasons (and yes, he was) for why it was better were that it helped (a lot) when the complexity got large.
2013-06-16 20:47:49	mythmon	true
2013-06-16 20:49:10	aleph	I'd like to see a rebuttal (if possible) from Angular enthusiasts
2013-06-16 20:50:00	aleph	One thing I worried about was he was just getting into Angular and might have misunderstood some issues.
2013-06-16 20:54:33	mythmon	one of the comments was kind of like that
2013-06-16 20:54:38	mythmon	but the arguments seemed week.
2013-06-16 20:54:55	mythmon	I would like to see a full essay about why angular beats ember.
2013-06-16 20:55:27	aleph	Or at least better arg(s) than in the comments

2013-06-16 21:03:21	mythmon	...and lives.
2013-06-16 21:03:59	pilgrimd	I went full stallman once.
2013-06-16 21:04:15	clarkb	did you buy one of those mips computers?
2013-06-16 21:04:23	dcolish	you emailed webpages to yourself using emacs and gnus?
2013-06-16 21:04:30	pilgrimd	dcolish: Oh yes.
2013-06-16 21:04:37	clarkb	It is really hard to stop playing The Last of Us
2013-06-16 21:04:56	pilgrimd	I was working at a place where we could send email, but not browse the web.
2013-06-16 21:05:09	dcolish	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw
2013-06-16 21:05:22	pilgrimd	So I set up a thing where I could email a URI to a special address, it would fetch the page, format it in to a 72-column plaintext email and send it back.
2013-06-16 21:05:42	dcolish	you could have just used stallmans setup :)
2013-06-16 21:06:11	pilgrimd	I wasn't allowed to run emacs locally.
2013-06-16 21:06:27	pilgrimd	(I only had a windows machine)
2013-06-16 21:06:28	dcolish	haha
2013-06-16 21:07:04	pilgrimd	I try not to think of those times.  They were dark and desperate.
2013-06-16 21:08:12	pilgrimd	But then again, I'm spoiled now.  I have 105/20 service at home, it's actual speed is around 108/52 and I get impatient if my files download at less than 5 MB/s.
2013-06-16 21:09:01	clarkb	pilgrimd: I have this problem too. It is a good problem :)
2013-06-16 21:09:32	pilgrimd	clarkb: I'm actually thinking about cutting the service back down to 50/10 since very few places manage to sustain more than about 70 Mbps.
2013-06-16 21:10:14	clarkb	pilgrimd: I currently have 100mbps (they don't separate advertise up and down) and it comes out to about 70/24
2013-06-16 21:10:38	clarkb	pilgrimd: steam does a reasonably good job as does netflix
2013-06-16 21:10:55	pilgrimd	I'll know more this summer.
2013-06-16 21:11:05	clarkb	though you may need to be using their special you peered with us quality streams
2013-06-16 21:11:26	dcolish	the other week, i didnt have internet at home
2013-06-16 21:11:29	pilgrimd	Just got memory and CPU upgrades for the router.  I have enough compute power in it now to do full-stream DPI statistics.
2013-06-16 21:11:38	dcolish	manpages turn out to be awesome

2013-06-16 21:12:19	pilgrimd	Along with a database app I'm writing to let me tag IP addresses so the charts show aggregates like "Netflix", "Google", "Facebook", etc.
2013-06-16 21:12:22	+alevar	except when they suck
2013-06-16 21:12:43	dcolish	well then you have the headers
2013-06-16 21:13:53	clarkb	pilgrimd: it is kind of annoying that mirrors.cat will only give me ~2MBps
2013-06-16 21:14:29	pilgrimd	clarkb: I just run my own mirror site. :)
2013-06-16 21:15:26	dcolish	oh disposable income, i miss you

2013-06-16 21:18:58	pilgrimd	Kids are expensive as fuck.
2013-06-16 21:19:09	pilgrimd	And you get such a lousy ROI, too.
2013-06-16 21:19:49	dcolish	its worth it
2013-06-16 21:20:01	 *	pilgrimd is unsure.
2013-06-16 21:20:16	pilgrimd	I don't trust any investment that can't provide a detailed prospectus.

2013-06-16 21:20:43	dcolish	oh i'm sure my kid will give you one, as long as you dont mind a few inconsistencies
2013-06-16 21:21:53	pilgrimd	The other part is the secondary market sucks.  Ever tried selling a kid or buying upgrades?  It's like pulling teeth.
2013-06-16 21:22:16	bkero	They do for quite a bit on the secondary market. I've considered it.
2013-06-16 21:22:28	pilgrimd	That wouldn't be so bad except the dealer's ordering system is designed to screw you and the factory gets the assembly wrong quite often.
2013-06-16 21:22:34	dcolish	dudes, you raise them to be sucessful and then they take care of you
2013-06-16 21:22:46	bkero	I decided I would need to do it consistently to make a living off it.

2013-06-17 16:28:06	Corbin	mythmon: "20% cooler" is a pony meme. A character says that she needs something to be a little cooler. It's not unlike "What is this, a school for ants!? It needs to be at least... *three* times bigger!"

2013-06-18 09:53:37	sabreman	do most of you host your sessions at PSU, or somewhere else?
2013-06-18 09:54:02	sabreman	Cause If I could host mine somewhere else (with a relitivly good up-time and for free) that would be sweet
2013-06-18 09:54:17	sabreman	especialy if I could use the package manager.....
2013-06-18 09:56:51	clarkb	sabreman: I think a good chunk of people use PSU and anothe rgood chunk use other things
2013-06-18 09:57:12	tamgc	so in short, "Yes."
2013-06-18 09:57:28	clarkb	sabreman: but finding good free hosting with root is probably hard
2013-06-18 09:57:45	tamgc	clarkb: just set one up yourself at home=)

2013-06-18 10:09:27	Kraytul	Or you could just be honest and actually pay for services you use... I know this is a crazy concept in today's world.
2013-06-18 10:09:56	tamgc	Kraytul: yes, today's world
2013-06-18 10:11:51	TheShazbot	pay for things? D:
2013-06-18 10:12:30	tamgc	I believe technically, in a starbucks, if you're using AT&T, you've already paid for the service (unless they've changed things)
2013-06-18 10:14:27	tamgc	or apparently not, their free wifi is no purchase or subscription or password required, and no time limit on your session

2013-06-18 10:16:04	tamgc	with the way wifi bleeds, you could prob live on a lower floor of Broadway and get free wifi from the starbucks there
2013-06-18 10:17:02	tamgc	what I'm wondering is, if Kraytul considers using that to still be dishonest
2013-06-18 10:17:33	Kraytul	I didn't say anything about dishonesty did I?
2013-06-18 10:17:57	tamgc	"Or you could just be honest and actually pay for services you use"
2013-06-18 10:17:59	zacharyp	dishonestly pay for something
2013-06-18 10:18:17	Kraytul	tamgc: that doesn't regard what would be dishonest.
2013-06-18 10:18:22	 *	tamgc was parsing that as saying using the wifi at the companies to be dishonest
2013-06-18 10:18:41	Kraytul	Parsing things unwritten is a dangerous practice.

2013-06-18 14:27:40	zacharyp	and does make me lament that the P4 won't play P3 games
2013-06-18 14:28:07	Corbin	Backwards compatibility is tough if the hardware changes.
2013-06-18 14:28:29	mythmon	Well, backwards compatibility + forward progress is hard.
2013-06-18 14:28:39	retrov	early PS3 models were not backwards compatible
2013-06-18 14:28:41	mythmon	if you just want backwards compatibility, you can do that. Just look at Intel.
2013-06-18 14:28:44	retrov	they basically had PS2s in them
2013-06-18 14:28:56	Corbin	Bingo.
2013-06-18 14:29:01	mythmon	so I want a box that has a ps4, a ps3, and a ps2 in it.
2013-06-18 14:29:04	mythmon	(not really)
2013-06-18 14:29:08	zacharyp	actually, early PS3 models *were* backwards compatible
2013-06-18 14:29:11	zacharyp	they removed that feature later
2013-06-18 14:29:13	Corbin	Wiis are backwards-compatible because they had the exact same chipset as Gamecubes, just faster.
2013-06-18 14:29:15	Kraytul	They're expensive now.
2013-06-18 14:29:36	Corbin	zacharyp: Well, the feature was partially hardware-backed; they put one of the PS2's chips inside early PS3s.
2013-06-18 14:29:50	zacharyp	yea, well, I want to play Last of Us
2013-06-18 14:29:53	zacharyp	:P
2013-06-18 14:30:01	mythmon	how long until a pc can emulate a ps3?
2013-06-18 14:30:02	Kraytul	I wanna play Last Guardian already...
2013-06-18 14:30:08	zacharyp	and I will be buying a PS4 most likely
2013-06-18 14:35:41	clarkb	zacharyp: it is worth it
2013-06-18 14:35:52	clarkb	(ps3 for last of us)
2013-06-18 14:42:38	zacharyp	I'm not buying a third PS3
2013-06-18 14:43:17	Kraytul	thhhird?
2013-06-18 14:43:52	clarkb	steal one then >_>
2013-06-18 14:44:19	Corbin	zacharyp: *Third*? I have two questions for you, then. :3
2013-06-18 14:53:04	zacharyp	my first one stopped working after 4 years
2013-06-18 14:53:14	zacharyp	the second one (slim) I only hade two years before selling it
2013-06-18 14:53:49	zacharyp	sold it last year because I thought there wouldn't be any more good games for it before the PS4
2013-06-18 14:54:15	zacharyp	guess I was wrong, ha

2013-06-18 15:14:03	retrov	mythmon: probably a very long time. it's only within the past year or so that PS2 games have been playably emulatable
2013-06-18 15:16:24	retrov	zacharyp: there were 2 revisions of BC PS3s. one had the PS2 CPU and GPU on the board. the later one just had the GPU and emulated the CPU in software
2013-06-18 15:23:30	zacharyp	I honestly don't care about backwards compatibility
2013-06-18 15:23:47	retrov	my old PS2 broke, so i managed to snag a new slim one
2013-06-18 15:24:05	zacharyp	I'm all for giving up on outdated technology when building something new
2013-06-18 15:24:36	clarkb	zacharyp: I agree. What is more frustrating is when they advertise a feature then remove it down the road

2013-06-19 15:36:51	Corbin	TIL: You can abuse C's static keyword to force a compile-time NULL check: void f(int x[static 1]); instead of void f(int *x);
2013-06-19 15:38:15	kini	nice
2013-06-19 15:38:57	Corbin	This works because of pointer-array weak type decay; the static annotation forces the compiler to prove that the passed "array" will always have at least one entry.
2013-06-19 15:39:45	Corbin	Of course, C's rules make the proof rather easy, but it'll keep you from declaring int *x = NULL; locally unless you assign to x in every conditional prior to calling f(x);
2013-06-19 15:41:18	greghaynes	nice
2013-06-19 15:43:16	dcolish	thats pretty neat
2013-06-19 15:44:52	Corbin	I've *never* seen this before. It makes sense in hindsight, though.

2013-06-19 15:45:40	dcolish	hmm,doesnt seem to work for me
2013-06-19 15:45:55	Kraytul	that's neat... what compiler?
2013-06-19 15:45:59	Corbin	Might only work in C99 mode.

2013-06-19 15:46:53	dcolish	hmm nope
2013-06-19 15:47:09	dcolish	compiles fine
2013-06-19 15:48:08	Corbin	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/2323/ works for me.
2013-06-19 15:49:07	dcolish	it should fail if &x is NULL right?
2013-06-19 15:49:20	greghaynes	if x is null
2013-06-19 15:49:32	greghaynes	wait, &x
2013-06-19 15:49:34	greghaynes	for that code
2013-06-19 15:49:34	dcolish	in Corbin's code x is an int
2013-06-19 15:49:37	dcolish	yeha
2013-06-19 15:49:39	Corbin	https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/presentation/d/1h49gY3TSiayLMXYmRMaAEMl05FaJ-Z6jDOWOz3EsqqQ/preview is what I'm reading, BTW.
2013-06-19 15:49:49	Epitrope	f(NULL) should fail
2013-06-19 15:50:32	dcolish	hmm
2013-06-19 15:51:07	dcolish	yeah its not failing
2013-06-19 15:51:09	Corbin	Hm, not seeing the compiler failure I'd expected here either.

2013-06-19 17:12:15	@cbeck	I went to his talk today, was very good
2013-06-19 17:12:48	kini	wish I could have made it on monday

2013-06-19 17:16:26	tamgc	alevar: so, yeah...communications/writing becomes faster and faster, and it's been a trend for a long time...but that comes with technology
2013-06-19 17:16:57	kini	oh, I didn't take it that way
2013-06-19 17:17:05	tamgc	doesn't really make the point of worrying about language changing for the worst any less (in)valid
2013-06-19 17:17:09	kini	I thought it was pointing out how people have always been bitching about how life is too fast these days
2013-06-19 17:17:53	tamgc	we're in an age where the amount of content created is more than we'd ever be able to consume in a lifetime
2013-06-19 17:18:06	tamgc	created/accessible
2013-06-19 17:19:00	tamgc	and communications have become more benign (twitter)
2013-06-19 17:19:45	tamgc	I'm sure historians will be able to derive stuff from twitter in the future, but it's a lot less effective than a letter from the 1800s
2013-06-19 17:19:57	tamgc	when there's more noise:information
2013-06-19 17:20:26	tamgc	of course, better filters will exist to comb through new mediums, whereas people actually have to read the letters though
2013-06-19 17:21:23	tamgc	but I'd have to wonder how much information is lost from filters in that regard...
2013-06-19 17:23:23	TheShazbot	not enough
2013-06-19 17:23:40	TheShazbot	imagine historians looking back at the fashion fads
2013-06-19 17:23:48	TheShazbot	and going "wow, what were they thinking?"
2013-06-19 17:25:45	Epitrope	I think I'd need to be convinced that twitter has a lower SNR than 1800s letters
2013-06-19 17:25:56	tamgc	or finding classics such as Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey
2013-06-19 17:26:25	Epitrope	it seems plausible, but I think the big difference is how much data there is
2013-06-19 17:26:32	tamgc	ayep
2013-06-19 17:26:48	tamgc	and accessibility to create the data
2013-06-19 17:27:05	tamgc	vs. in the past, required literacy/had higher resource costs in some fashion
2013-06-19 17:27:50	Epitrope	I suppose spam skews things pretty dramatically... like it always does
2013-06-19 17:27:58	tamgc	(aka, I doubt people were writing about what they had for breakfast unless it had some weight)
2013-06-19 17:28:24	 *	tamgc imagines 1800s people spamming with manually written letters=)
2013-06-19 17:28:41	Epitrope	that's the canonical example of frivolous tweeting, but I have no idea how often people actually do that
2013-06-19 17:29:02	Epitrope	now that twitter is relatively mature and stable, and people have a better understanding of how it works
2013-06-19 17:29:13	tamgc	true
2013-06-19 17:29:46	tamgc	but like email, chances are the maturity has probably increased the accessibility...
2013-06-19 17:30:20	Epitrope	well, I'm considering the possibility that the omnomnom tweets were growing pains
2013-06-19 17:31:22	TheShazbot	you've got my attention
2013-06-19 17:31:29	TheShazbot	!epitrope
2013-06-19 17:31:35	TheShazbot	(insert gif)
2013-06-19 17:32:49	tamgc	would you consider things like chain emails growing pains?
2013-06-19 17:33:31	Epitrope	hm... not sure
2013-06-19 17:33:41	tamgc	seems like email will be a decent analog to twitter
2013-06-19 17:33:42	Epitrope	there were chain letters, too, weren't there?

2013-06-20 14:29:52	kini	I will try to read it. I don't know how far I'll get since I don't have much background in type theory, but it looks awesome
2013-06-20 14:30:09	Kraytul	Yeah I don't either, but it still looks interesting and claims to be accessible
2013-06-20 14:30:26	Kraytul	It even suggests you don't need much formal logic, so it should be pretty workable
2013-06-20 14:30:55	Kraytul	"The present work has its origins in our collective attempts to
2013-06-20 14:30:56	Kraytul	develop a new style of “informal type theory” that can be read and understood by a human being, as a complement to a formal proof that can be checked by a machine."

2013-06-20 15:59:59	eidolon	there's certain 13", 19", 25", and 27" tubes that are worth a bit as spares for video game monitors since they never end up with burn in in television use
2013-06-20 16:02:36	bkero	Which channels are burned in the most?
2013-06-20 16:31:24	TheShazbot	I'd say daytime tv
2013-06-20 16:31:44	TheShazbot	a maury or jerry springer logo burnin on the bottom right

2013-06-20 22:18:52	MaddHatter	does anybody have a not-ugly way of dealing with iterating through containers of variable-length containers in cpp?
2013-06-20 22:19:29	MaddHatter	I invariably end up with another container of iterators and then get constructs like if (cii->second->second->first.type == foo) etc.
2013-06-20 22:20:20	MaddHatter	and the whole increment an iterator-pointing-to-an-iterator is mind-bending enough that one has to draw on the whiteboard every time one touches the code
2013-06-20 22:26:42	clarkb	something like foo = iterator; while(bar = foo.next()){ while (zort = bar.next()) { zort.do_something(); } } ?
2013-06-20 22:28:48	MaddHatter	no...
2013-06-20 22:34:19	aleph	Why not iterate through the different levels separately?
2013-06-20 22:35:07	MaddHatter	stuff like http://ideone.com/YW4NGI for example
2013-06-20 22:35:47	dcolish	for(itr=container.begin(); it!= container.end(); it++) {}
2013-06-20 22:36:23	dcolish	then you've got an inner loop i suppose
2013-06-20 22:36:24	MaddHatter	oh, I forgot to actually increment the iterators in that paste, but you get the idea
2013-06-20 22:39:51	dcolish	you could also implement a chaining iterator
2013-06-20 22:40:05	MaddHatter	that sounds promising... what is it?
2013-06-20 22:41:03	dcolish	something like ChainItor(itor1, itor2) etc, then you use that directly and it will start the next itor when ready
2013-06-20 22:41:04	MaddHatter	(annoyingly, I'm not allowed to use Boost)
2013-06-20 22:41:18	dcolish	you could also make the API take a collection of collections
2013-06-20 22:41:26	dcolish	as the CTOR
2013-06-20 22:41:39	dcolish	i didnt see that in boost
2013-06-20 22:41:57	dcolish	its a pretty common pattern
2013-06-20 22:42:38	dcolish	it does assume homogeneous types
2013-06-20 22:44:18	MaddHatter	homogeneous meaning all the map template types are the same, or just that everything's a map?
2013-06-20 22:44:48	dcolish	types are the same
2013-06-20 22:45:01	dcolish	also you can now use std::begin and std::end in c++11
2013-06-20 22:45:17	MaddHatter	our compiler is just a hair too old for a lot of c++11
2013-06-20 22:45:23	dcolish	those are recommended over obj::begin()
2013-06-20 22:45:25	dcolish	bummer
2013-06-20 22:45:36	greghaynes	Qt has some really neat stuff with iterators but im guessing thats out
2013-06-20 22:45:38	greghaynes	like a for each
2013-06-20 22:45:45	dcolish	boost has a for each too
2013-06-20 22:45:51	dcolish	but c++11 has one as well
2013-06-20 22:45:51	greghaynes	oo
2013-06-20 22:45:55	MaddHatter	the guys in Boise have updated to a newer gcc, and they have c++11 and torture me by telling me how much better it is :-(
2013-06-20 22:45:58	greghaynes	I wonder how boost implements it
2013-06-20 22:46:10	dcolish	it looks terrible honestly
2013-06-20 22:46:17	dcolish	the new c++11 foreach is nice
2013-06-20 22:46:35	MaddHatter	Even being able to have const map types using emplace would be nice
2013-06-20 22:46:40	greghaynes	yea, makes sense, Qt can do it because they have their own preprocessor
2013-06-20 22:46:48	greghaynes	but pure cpp would be nasty
2013-06-20 22:47:16	dcolish	new style is for (auto i : foo){}}
2013-06-20 22:47:26	dcolish	oh yeah use auto errywhrr
2013-06-20 22:47:37	dcolish	and {} over () for initialization
2013-06-20 22:47:39	clarkb	isn't auto default?
2013-06-20 22:47:45	dcolish	different auto
2013-06-20 22:47:57	dcolish	this is C++11 dont ruin it with your dirty old K&R C
2013-06-20 22:48:07	dcolish	rather, B
2013-06-20 22:48:12	clarkb	but damnit auto is implied :P
2013-06-20 22:48:12	dcolish	geez auto is old
2013-06-20 22:48:24	MaddHatter	for a while, they tried to ditch static, too
2013-06-20 22:48:37	MaddHatter	sanity seems to have prevailed on that though
2013-06-20 22:49:15	MaddHatter	but at least now static can be purely about storage type, and anonymous namespaces can be purely about access
2013-06-20 22:51:13	MaddHatter	Adobe apparently has an adobe labs lib, and it has an any_iterator
2013-06-20 22:53:32	dcolish	i wish there was something more like guava in C++. boost is too freaking big
2013-06-20 22:53:49	dcolish	guava is pretty nice because its small and gets to the point
2013-06-20 22:55:51	clarkb	doesn't boost get distributed in chunks?

2013-06-23 02:34:29	Orpheon	Hello, I need some help concerning makefiles
2013-06-23 02:37:54	mythmon	Orpheon: awfully early/late to be working on makefiles.
2013-06-23 02:38:09	Orpheon	why?
2013-06-23 02:38:30	mythmon	2:30am is generally the time for drinking of sleeping, not hacking, but to each his own, I guess.
2013-06-23 02:38:41	Orpheon	it's 11:38 am here
2013-06-23 02:38:44	mythmon	s/of/or/
2013-06-23 02:38:51	Orpheon	anyways
2013-06-23 02:38:59	mythmon	ah. I generally expect pacific time in here.
2013-06-23 02:39:06	Orpheon	I've cobbled together this line from various sources on the internet OBJ = $($(SRC):%.c = $(OBJECT_DIR)/%.o)
2013-06-23 02:39:06	 *	bkero is hacking.
2013-06-23 02:39:24	Orpheon	SRC is a list of all files ending in .c
2013-06-23 02:39:46	Orpheon	echo'ing OBJ prints an empty line
2013-06-23 02:40:01	mythmon	Orpheon: what is the goal?
2013-06-23 02:40:14	mythmon	to provide a rule for turning all .c into .o?
2013-06-23 02:40:21	Orpheon	to compile anything ending with .c into a .o in a directory
2013-06-23 02:40:23	Orpheon	yes
2013-06-23 02:40:45	mythmon	http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.79.1/html_chapter/make_10.html
2013-06-23 02:41:38	mythmon	bkero: hmm. I must just be grumpy considering the reason for my wakefulness.
2013-06-23 02:42:03	bkero	mythmon: grumpifying?
2013-06-23 02:42:23	mythmon	bkero: I just don't like having a 6am flight.
2013-06-23 02:42:31	bkero	I wouldn't either.
2013-06-23 02:43:09	Orpheon	last time I had that, minecraft prevented me from becoming too grumpy
2013-06-23 02:43:30	mythmon	when I booked it I thought 6pm, which is a lot nicer.
2013-06-23 02:43:49	mythmon	hmm... I *just* got firefox back on this laptop, I don't think minecraft is going to happen before my flight.
2013-06-23 02:43:53	mythmon	not a bad idea though.
2013-06-23 02:44:03	bkero	mythmon: you update nouveau?
2013-06-23 02:44:07	mythmon	bkero: ha.
2013-06-23 02:44:20	mythmon	so, that update ended up trashing my system for some reason which i have yet to discern.
2013-06-23 02:44:33	bkero	archfail?
2013-06-23 02:44:54	mythmon	i'm blaiming user error, because i did a thing any arch user will tell you is stupid.
2013-06-23 02:45:03	bkero	update?
2013-06-23 02:45:03	mythmon	(--force in the package manager)
2013-06-23 02:45:37	mythmon	Anyways, instead of fighting it I did lvcreate -n root2 -L 20G tank
2013-06-23 02:46:49	Orpheon	I read the section about pattern rules
2013-06-23 02:46:54	Orpheon	of what you linked
2013-06-23 02:47:13	mythmon	Orpheon: my point there was that if you set up the compiler right, Make already has the rule you want.
2013-06-23 02:47:30	Orpheon	ah
2013-06-23 02:47:43	Orpheon	except that everything I read assumes object files are in the same dir
2013-06-23 02:47:46	Orpheon	which I don't want
2013-06-23 02:47:51	mythmon	ah.
2013-06-23 02:48:18	 *	mythmon is not a make expert.
2013-06-23 02:48:32	Orpheon	so my question is, how do I apply a pattern rule to a list? (or whatever a wildcard is)
2013-06-23 02:57:42	mythmon	Orpheon: it looks like it would be   %.o : %.c \n\t $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $(OBJECTSDIR)/$@
2013-06-23 02:57:57	Orpheon	compilation works
2013-06-23 02:58:03	Orpheon	it's the linking that's giving troubles
2013-06-23 02:58:06	mythmon	ah.
2013-06-23 02:58:18	Orpheon	I gave up having it in a variable
2013-06-23 02:58:19	Orpheon	so
2013-06-23 02:58:23	Orpheon	$(OBJECT_DIR)/%.o: $(SRC)
2013-06-23 02:58:23	Orpheon		gcc $(CFLAGS) $(INC) -c $< -o $@
2013-06-23 02:58:25	Orpheon	works
2013-06-23 02:58:33	Orpheon	wait no it doesn't
2013-06-23 02:58:43	Orpheon	it just creates a file "%.o" :/
2013-06-23 02:58:54	mythmon	lol
2013-06-23 02:59:05	Orpheon	but I think that's the linkers fault too
2013-06-23 02:59:09	mythmon	I'm really the wrong person to ask, sorry.
2013-06-23 02:59:10	Orpheon	because it requests that
2013-06-23 02:59:16	Orpheon	ok
2013-06-23 02:59:31	Orpheon	I just came here because http://cat.pdx.edu/documents/make.html
2013-06-23 02:59:34	Orpheon	:P
2013-06-23 02:59:59	mythmon	ah. Funny thing, I'm not even from PSU.
2013-06-23 03:04:29	Orpheon	would you know any other IRC channel?
2013-06-23 03:04:49	Orpheon	googling "makefile IRC channel" or similar always returns a few thousand src repos of IRC bots that use make
2013-06-23 03:07:25	mythmon	nothing really comes to mind, and in about 12 hours this would certainly be a good place to ask.
2013-06-23 03:07:34	mythmon	probably sooner, even.

2013-06-23 20:34:35	mythmon	bkero: my suggestion was an alternate rom called Paranoid Android. Using that you can change which kind of device the tablet thinks it is, one of which puts the notifications on the bottom.
2013-06-23 20:34:44	bkero	I see
2013-06-23 20:37:21	mythmon	also, yay compton did what I wanted.

2013-06-23 20:38:28	mythmon	yeah, that's basically what PA does. If you can convince android you have a different dpi screen, that should work.
2013-06-23 20:39:19	mythmon	though PA does it per-app, which means the notifications have their own dpi.

2013-06-24 10:55:29	david	is there a tool that takes "license text" and tells you the name of the license? for example, what license is: http://paste.lisp.org/display/137761/raw ?
2013-06-24 10:56:39	clarkb	david: that looks like a 3 clause BSD license
2013-06-24 10:57:09	clarkb	david: I'm not sure if there are tools that will tell you a license given partial info. There are tools that try to tell you under which licenses a project falls
2013-06-24 10:57:24	clarkb	david: those might be smart enough to give you the info you want. /me looks for one
2013-06-24 10:58:16	clarkb	googling for them is a pita apparently, but they do exist
2013-06-24 11:02:18	david	someone should write a tool that takes text as input and finds the license with the shortest edit distance from the input :)
2013-06-24 11:03:48	david	clarkb: I think you're right. it's BSD3
2013-06-24 11:03:53	greghaynes	psh, I think we can do a much better distance metric
2013-06-24 11:03:55	greghaynes	that would be fun
2013-06-24 11:04:34	greghaynes	even better, it would be need to LSI them and see what topics define different licenses
2013-06-24 11:04:41	greghaynes	along with their similarity
2013-06-24 11:05:05	david	that would be cool
2013-06-24 11:07:24	clarkb	david: eventually you end up reading enough of them that you just know what they are

2013-06-24 11:11:56	clarkb	mythmon: where automation like this would be neat for me is in getting something that can tell you where licenses are not applied correctly or are in conflict with each other. but that is less of a text identification problem and a graph problem
2013-06-24 11:12:21	dcolish	thats the dream of cabal
2013-06-24 11:12:30	dcolish	it can actually warn about license issues

2013-06-24 14:30:17	bkero	alevar: I think there's a voluntary transition of some people to ipv6 followed by them switching some people over and providing an ipv4 tunnel.

2013-06-24 14:42:13	clarkb	yeah but IP. I wouldn't be surprised if it is picky about radios so you can keep the current device and use it as an AP
2013-06-24 14:42:18	pilgrimd	bkero: CMTS = the thing on Comcast's end of your cable service.  You can't not be connected to it and still have DOCSIS service.
2013-06-24 14:43:37	pilgrimd	alevar: I would think that "I had to replace my network equipment" is a completely reasonable and expected scenario the USGS would have anticipated.
2013-06-24 14:43:50	pilgrimd	It would be no different than if you moved and your ISP-provided router changed.

2013-06-24 14:46:03	pilgrimd	bkero: Their end knows they provisioned a D2 device for you.  Also, your device starts the conversation, so the CMTS knows you're speaking D2.
2013-06-24 14:46:28	pilgrimd	I wouldn't be suprised if at some point in the near future Comcast asks/tells/forces you to get a D3 device.

2013-06-25 10:03:14	pilgrimd	Fun tidbit today: I had to learn how to downgrade a Debian package because, get this, the version of a package apt was installing by default was too new.
2013-06-25 10:04:05	clarkb	pilgrimd: was that a failure of the package or custom apt rules? it is fairly easy to do something weird like that with a couple lines in a config file
2013-06-25 10:04:43	pilgrimd	clarkb: legacy config file, "apt get foo" installed a later version that wasn't compatible with the existing config.
2013-06-25 10:04:45	dcolish	sometimes you just want to downgrade
2013-06-25 10:05:24	pilgrimd	It was more the fact that, of all distros, Debian had a package that was newer than it needed to be.
2013-06-25 10:05:34	dcolish	sounds like you should hold it
2013-06-25 10:05:47	dcolish	yeah it is pretty ironic
2013-06-25 10:06:38	pilgrimd	dcolish: Yeah, once I had the older-than-Debian package installed, I did so.  Then sent an email to the project lead suggesting we refactor that shit so we can run something from *this* decade.

2013-06-25 10:12:02	pilgrimd	I also have a dual Pentium Pro board.  I wonder if 2.2.0 is new enough to support it?  Would probably need to compile an SMP kernel.

2013-06-25 22:24:27	kini	Earlier in the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules. That view was upheld in a vote, and she was given a warning.

2013-06-25 22:27:02	dondon	kini: how much artificial support should be allowed in upholding a filibuster though? the whole point is the standing, so if you came in with the brace, I can see that used, but having help is against the Texas rules of filibuster

2013-06-26 21:39:28	kini	because you found the complete series on a shelf in the public library
2013-06-26 21:40:13	lewisrjc	incomplete series, my old man's library
2013-06-26 21:40:22	 *	lewisrjc thinks I was 8...it was grade school for sure
2013-06-26 21:40:31	kini	oh
2013-06-26 21:40:41	lewisrjc	good series though
2013-06-26 21:40:42	kini	I saw the whole series in a library once as a kid, and read the first volume but never got around to the rest
2013-06-26 21:40:55	lewisrjc	yeah, it's...good
2013-06-26 21:41:17	lewisrjc	it has a lot of eastern philosophy littered throughout, in retrospect somewhat ostentatiously actually...

2013-06-28 20:29:23	nightfly	It's not even a leak, by closing over a variable you're saying you still want to refer to it.
2013-06-28 20:46:42	kini	but they're not closing over the variable
2013-06-28 20:48:09	kini	if I understand correctly the article is about how the giant string isn't garbage collected because there is a symbol table that's shared by two closures, one which closes over the string but quickly dies, and another which doesn't close over the string but sticks around forever

2013-06-29 21:36:34	kini	how does "/< |.\>" search for words of four letters
2013-06-29 21:37:51	kini	ggguG sets all text to lower case but also moves you to the top of the file

2013-06-30 10:52:03	bkero	Corbin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0
2013-06-30 10:55:49	--	NetworkModule is now known as JoeAngry
2013-06-30 11:12:29	Corbin	bkero: Yay for not wasting money on bridges that aren't needed!
2013-06-30 11:13:51	bkero	Corbin: I believe part of the $170mil that was spent on planning was to determine if it will be needed. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
2013-06-30 11:14:44	Corbin	bkero: Oh, no, this was *totally* something that a single firm tried to push through so that they could have several decades of delicious government contracts from both OR and WA.
2013-06-30 11:14:58	bkero	Corbin: which firm was that?
2013-06-30 11:16:40	Corbin	bkero: David Evans & Assoc. from Portland.
2013-06-30 11:17:04	clarkb	Corbin: most of the opposition had nothing to do with that though
2013-06-30 11:17:23	clarkb	Corbin: it failed beacuse vancouverites hate MAX and the coast guard has needs that they didn't accomodate
2013-06-30 11:18:01	bkero	"failed" is a strong word. The WA senate let it pass by their table without saying anything. Moved right along, right into the trash can. No suggestions, feedback, referendums, or votes.
2013-06-30 11:18:13	Corbin	clarkb: Yeah. It's funny how even broken clocks are right twice a day.
2013-06-30 11:18:52	clarkb	bkero: the plan the coast guard said no to was actually pretty far along
2013-06-30 11:19:01	clarkb	bkero: but they have veto power on these sorts of things
2013-06-30 11:21:23	bkero	On the plus side I did learn that Washington has a $10 billion transportation revenue package.
2013-06-30 11:21:32	bkero	Which they will presumably spend to finally have public transit.
2013-06-30 11:21:54	Corbin	Huh? We've got lots of public transit.
2013-06-30 11:22:05	Corbin	It's just all in the Seattle area.
2013-06-30 11:22:38	bkero	I must have completely missed it while I was there.
2013-06-30 11:23:01	bkero	Unless you're counting the monorail
2013-06-30 11:23:25	Corbin	Well, downtown, most of it's underground.
2013-06-30 11:23:31	clarkb	bkero: busses, ferries, LINK, SLUT, and so on
2013-06-30 11:23:32	Corbin	There are busses and light rail underneath downtown.
2013-06-30 11:24:04	clarkb	there is the new capitol and first hill streetcar too and LINK will go all the way to UW in a year or so
2013-06-30 11:25:07	bkero	http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Central-Link-light-rail <-- this?
2013-06-30 11:25:15	bkero	I hope they eventually have more than one line :P
2013-06-30 11:25:49	Corbin	They're working on putting in lines in Bellevue (across I-90!) and Federal Way.
2013-06-30 11:26:09	bkero	So they'll have mass transit someday :)
2013-06-30 11:26:11	Corbin	Anyway, that one line is all that's needed. It goes from downtown at Westlake all the way to SEA-TAC.
2013-06-30 11:26:33	bkero	That's useful to get to the airport, and maybe somewhere inbetween.
2013-06-30 11:26:58	Corbin	Turns out that that's where everybody is. :3
2013-06-30 11:27:38	bkero	Except for everyone on the east side or north of there.
2013-06-30 11:28:03	Corbin	Would you believe that everybody that works in Bellevue and Redmond owns a car?
2013-06-30 11:28:28	bkero	They'd have to due to the stunning lack of a transit system. ;)
2013-06-30 11:28:49	clarkb	bkero: its definitely subpar, but mass transit != light rail
2013-06-30 11:29:28	bkero	clarkb: mass transit != light rail, but light rail is definitely a good part of it. Having a majority of it being a shitty bus system just doesn't cut it.
2013-06-30 11:29:34	clarkb	the same argument could invalidate Trimet if you compared it to new york or tokyo or or seoul etc
2013-06-30 11:30:17	bkero	Yep, but trimet is working on opening several new lines, building bridges, linking new parts of the metro area on the MAX.
2013-06-30 11:31:03	bkero	Anyway, I hope the $10bil goes to good use instead of propping up a shitty bus system.
2013-06-30 11:31:08	Corbin	bkero: Allow me to compare.
2013-06-30 11:31:25	Corbin	bkero: The Fry's up here is in Renton. The Fry's down there is in Wilsonville.
2013-06-30 11:31:37	Corbin	To get to Fry's from here, I have to travel about 20mi.
2013-06-30 11:31:43	Corbin	It takes busses 40min to do that.
2013-06-30 11:31:52	Corbin	And it would take the Portland area's transit about 90min.
2013-06-30 11:32:35	greghaynes	getting to the frys here is a friggin pilgrimage by pub transit
2013-06-30 11:32:44	greghaynes	gotta transfer to wilsonville lines
2013-06-30 11:32:50	greghaynes	then hike along a freewa
2013-06-30 11:33:17	bkero	Corbin: Wilsonville isn't part of the metro area. That would be like going from Bellevue, WA to Monroe, WA. Which isn't available at all.
2013-06-30 11:33:21	pilgrimd	Corbin: More than that, to take Trimet to Wilsonville, you've have to get on the commuter train in Beaverton.  It has a very limited schedule, so you'd spend the whole day in Wilsonville.
2013-06-30 11:33:34	greghaynes	you can bus to it
2013-06-30 11:33:41	greghaynes	but yea, ive definitely almost been stranded there
2013-06-30 11:33:52	bkero	The WES is an extension of the metro system, to link another metro area (I believe Wilsonville is part of the Salem-Keiser metro area)
2013-06-30 11:34:22	bkero	I think an equivalent would be a train to Bellingham?
2013-06-30 11:34:32	clarkb	bkero: more liek sounder to everret
2013-06-30 11:34:38	clarkb	to tacoma
2013-06-30 11:34:45	clarkb	*or to tacoma
2013-06-30 11:34:57	Corbin	Sounder to Everett would be about 40min from where I am, I think.
2013-06-30 11:35:06	clarkb	one of the neat things they did with the sounder fares up here is you can hop on an amtrak train too to get more coverage
2013-06-30 11:35:24	bkero	clarkb: Everett is still part of the metro area :P
2013-06-30 11:36:06	clarkb	bkero: but it is an equivalent distance on commuter rail
2013-06-30 11:36:25	Corbin	I dunno. You're drawing a *massive* metro area.
2013-06-30 11:36:39	bkero	It's on Seattle Metro Area's wikipedia page :P
2013-06-30 11:36:55	Corbin	But my point was more that transit can speedily get me to where I need to go.
2013-06-30 11:37:26	clarkb	fwiw I agree that trimet is better than most systems I have used in this country (just used the new york subway which is miles beyond anything else I have used in this country), but Seattles isn't horrible
2013-06-30 11:37:38	Corbin	The streetcars through Portland are great for e.g. to and from PSU, right?
2013-06-30 11:37:57	Corbin	Seattle's got busses to and from UW for nearly every Seattle neighborhood.
2013-06-30 11:38:00	clarkb	Portland's greatest asset has been robust city planning with future thought to public transit
2013-06-30 11:38:02	bkero	PSU up through the nortern reaches of the Pearl, then on the west side from Broadway down to Hawthorne
2013-06-30 11:38:05	Corbin	It's just a less rail-oriented system.
2013-06-30 11:38:18	clarkb	Seattle has shitty city planning because its a bunch of small towns and neighborhoods glommed together
2013-06-30 11:38:35	Corbin	clarkb: Seattle's history is hilarious.
2013-06-30 11:38:42	bkero	Portland still has to deal with 3 counties worth of mass transit muckery and a dozen cities worth
2013-06-30 11:38:59	bkero	Washington county has routinely given it a "fuck you"
2013-06-30 11:39:39	clarkb	bkero: they try but the tri county people have quite a bit of power
2013-06-30 11:39:42	bkero	So Portland has given them RESOLVED/EATADICK in regards to mass transit, and continued to progress down into Clackamas, out to Gresham, even to Troutdale
2013-06-30 11:39:48	clarkb	everything from urban development zoning to public transit
2013-06-30 11:40:40	clarkb	also I have a metrocard with at least one subway ride worth of fare on it if anyone wants it
2013-06-30 11:41:05	bkero	next person to go to ny, heh
2013-06-30 11:41:51	clarkb	it will save you $3.50 :)
2013-06-30 11:44:22	bkero	I've got some if anybody goes to Vancouver, Boston, or London. 5gbp deposit for a oystercard :(

2013-06-30 13:46:21	bkero	I think I looked at that one before, seemed kind of old

2013-06-30 13:50:14	clarkb	chrome is particularly bad about doing cert exceptions on android
2013-06-30 13:50:16	bkero	Epitrope: Use startssl, get a free *real* cert. :)
2013-06-30 13:50:32	Epitrope	bkero: as I understand it, startssl doesn't do subdomains
2013-06-30 13:50:48	bkero	Epitrope: Not sure about that. I actually paid them for a wildcard cert, and that certainly does.
2013-06-30 13:51:16	Epitrope	yep, it does
2013-06-30 13:52:44	clarkb	I think chrome wants you to properly copy your CA details instead of individually adding exceptions

2013-06-30 16:49:42	retrov	this heat is hurting my hacking
2013-06-30 16:49:51	retrov	i can only run 1 or 2 VMs instead of 5-6

2013-06-30 17:08:20	TheShazbot	probably a good choice
2013-06-30 17:22:11	Corbin	I didn't realize people needed VMs to hack.
2013-06-30 17:22:40	+alevar	Would people be interested in a very simple textbook exchange web site?
2013-06-30 17:22:57	TheShazbot	well, if they're using stuff like puppet
2013-06-30 17:23:00	+alevar	Just a simple add
2013-06-30 17:23:05	Corbin	Ah, yes.
2013-06-30 17:23:06	TheShazbot	managing vm's is sort of important
2013-06-30 17:23:16	TheShazbot	which is what I think retrov was working on
2013-06-30 17:23:23	retrov	Corbin: it's for getting gitlab and phabricator to play nice with each other
2013-06-30 17:23:27	Corbin	Aha.
2013-06-30 17:24:55	retrov	got gitlab setup but i can't push anything to it
2013-06-30 17:25:04	TheShazbot	git out of here with that mindset
2013-06-30 17:28:26	bkero	lulz. Facebook engineers rave about Phabricator, describing it with glowing terms like "okay" and "mandatory". Experience more uncoerced community interaction on Facebook.
2013-06-30 17:29:34	Corbin	Haha.
2013-06-30 17:29:57	Corbin	I'm guessing from the name that it is some sort of Fabric for PHP.
2013-06-30 17:30:10	bkero	Nope
2013-06-30 17:30:50	Corbin	Oh, wow. It's worse than I thought.
2013-06-30 17:30:54	Corbin	Why would you use this?
2013-06-30 17:32:30	TheShazbot	why wouldn't I use this
2013-06-30 17:32:42	bkero	sanity
2013-06-30 17:32:46	Corbin	Well, it's something that Facebook wrote and open-sourced.
2013-06-30 17:32:51	Corbin	So that's already a strike against it.
2013-06-30 17:33:35	bkero	Oh
2013-06-30 17:33:37	bkero	Oh wow
2013-06-30 17:33:39	bkero	phpsh: provides an interactive shell for PHP that features readline history, tab completion, and quick access to documentation. It is ironically written mostly in Python.
2013-06-30 17:34:19	Corbin	I find nothing ironic about that. Have you *tried* to write an app in PHP? It's arduous and painful.
2013-06-30 17:34:30	bkero	I've written many
2013-06-30 17:34:40	bkero	They'r eonly arduous and painful once they exceed 30 lines.
2013-06-30 17:34:48	bkero	or you try to do Real Work(TM) with it.
2013-06-30 17:34:57	Corbin	<?php phpinfo(); ?>
2013-06-30 17:35:10	bkero	I think I deserve some sort of medal for writing enough PHP to be on the Phoronix Test Suite contributors list.
2013-06-30 17:35:15	Corbin	Haha.
2013-06-30 17:35:25	bkero	The tests are...well
2013-06-30 17:35:33	Corbin	But seriously, do you know how many times I've caught people with little info.php scripts containing only the above? :c
2013-06-30 17:36:46	bkero	While looking for phoronix test suite on github. Wat. https://github.com/Parking-Ticket-Society/PTS
2013-06-30 17:44:11	+alevar	So many books, so few buyers.
2013-06-30 18:34:23	lewisrjc	?
2013-06-30 18:34:28	lewisrjc	alevar: to what do you refer?
2013-06-30 18:35:19	lewisrjc	karmabot: dn
2013-06-30 18:35:20	karmabot	dn(0)
2013-06-30 18:35:21	lewisrjc	karmabot: dns
2013-06-30 18:35:21	karmabot	dns(0): magic, ZOMG WTF, why's everything so slow??, "the problem with dns is that it isn't cached"
2013-06-30 19:27:44	Wren	Is this a good deal?: http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/syd/3893139418.html
2013-06-30 19:29:22	nightfly	Looks nice, probably have very good battery life though. And about on the opposite end of the build-quality spectrum as your decrepit Macbook Pro
2013-06-30 19:30:02	clarkb	elitebooks are decent build quality
2013-06-30 19:30:36	bkero	Is that an HP ultrabook?
2013-06-30 19:30:37	Wren	I don't need a high-end gaming laptop, but I want something that can play starcraft 2.
2013-06-30 19:30:50	clarkb	bkero: no its an elitebook
2013-06-30 19:30:56	clarkb	business machine
2013-06-30 19:31:06	bkero	clarkb: Is that a brand name or a market segment they're trying to create?
2013-06-30 19:31:14	clarkb	its a brand
2013-06-30 19:31:23	bkero	Ah
2013-06-30 19:31:31	clarkb	competes with thinkpad
2013-06-30 19:31:38	bkero	Wren: There's an awesome Ideapad Y laptop that can do some gaming and is still pretty cheap
2013-06-30 19:31:46	bkero	clarkb: comes with trackpoint plz? :3
2013-06-30 19:31:53	clarkb	it should
2013-06-30 19:32:08	clarkb	yup its in the image
2013-06-30 19:32:10	Wren	Where's another place to find reasonably priced computers?
2013-06-30 19:32:15	nightfly	Internet
2013-06-30 19:32:22	Wren	thanks
2013-06-30 19:32:42	nightfly	Sales at office supply stores can be pretty good sometimes too.
2013-06-30 19:32:42	kini	I had an HP elitebook for a while, well actually it was before they were called elitebooks but the same line
2013-06-30 19:32:44	bkero	clarkb: optional hilariously large battery?
2013-06-30 19:32:50	kini	it was awesome
2013-06-30 19:33:06	kini	I still have it and it still works fine, unfortunately the CCFL in the screen burned out
2013-06-30 19:34:11	clarkb	bkero: my elitebooks have always had flush batteries
2013-06-30 19:35:07	bkero	Wren: Ideapad Y500/Y510 are ~$800, (~$600 used), have ten eighty pees and GeForce GT750M's
2013-06-30 19:37:07	bkero	clarkb: I'm not seeing any haswells or trackpoints :(
2013-06-30 19:38:27	Wren	What about this one: http://portland.craigslist.org/clk/sys/3847533807.html
2013-06-30 19:38:53	bkero	Um, I'd want to figure out what model of laptop it is...
2013-06-30 19:39:11	bkero	They don't exactly list that
2013-06-30 19:39:21	+alevar	Does anyone happen to know protoben's phone number?
2013-06-30 19:39:31	clarkb	bkero: not sure about haswell but trackpounts are common
2013-06-30 19:39:32	bkero	3% battery, must close laptop + obtain dinner
2013-06-30 19:39:42	bkero	clarkb: wasn't on the 2570s I was looking at
2013-06-30 19:39:43	Wren	What about the G580s?
2013-06-30 19:39:59	bkero	If you can stand 1366x768@15"
2013-06-30 19:40:05	bkero	and don't mind intel integrated graphics
2013-06-30 19:40:26	TheShazbot	the Y500 me and Lycopene have
2013-06-30 19:40:29	TheShazbot	is pretty damn awesome
2013-06-30 19:41:26	TheShazbot	but honestly, lol a6-4400m sucks
2013-06-30 19:41:31	 *	pilgrimd LOLs at the 1366x768 screen "showcases movies and games in stunning clarity"
2013-06-30 19:41:33	TheShazbot	Wren: go haswell
2013-06-30 19:42:37	pilgrimd	Ya, you want an i7-4770.
2013-06-30 19:42:44	TheShazbot	in fact, the exact laptop I have is on sale for $840
2013-06-30 19:42:45	TheShazbot	online
2013-06-30 19:42:58	TheShazbot	15.6" - 1080p
2013-06-30 19:43:05	Wren	I don't need quite that good a laptop
2013-06-30 19:43:11	TheShazbot	8gb ram / 1tb hd
2013-06-30 19:43:16	TheShazbot	dude
2013-06-30 19:43:17	TheShazbot	what?
2013-06-30 19:43:59	+alevar	I hate how if a book goes out of date, it suddenly is barely worth the paper it's written on.
2013-06-30 19:44:14	TheShazbot	pretty much
2013-06-30 19:45:09	+alevar	I have stacks and stacks of books that were worth $100+ new, but now can't justify shipping costs.
2013-06-30 19:45:44	Wren	I'm not a huge gamer. Starcraft is really the only game I play regularly so I would be sad if I couldn't play that.
2013-06-30 19:46:22	Wren	But I'll probably just run Arch on it for the most part.
2013-06-30 19:49:46	TheShazbot	better get largely normal hardware then
2013-06-30 19:49:56	TheShazbot	instead of
2013-06-30 19:50:06	TheShazbot	"oh, this device doesn't work, there's no driver"
2013-06-30 19:54:18	Wren	Arch comes with NVIDIA's proprietary cards.
2013-06-30 19:56:53	Wren	I don't know. It might be worth it to buy a new laptop just because it will last longer
2013-06-30 20:00:06	+alevar	yeah
2013-06-30 20:00:23	+alevar	Other things I might go for used. Laptops, no.
2013-06-30 20:01:06	Wren	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834312432
2013-06-30 20:05:45	TheShazbot	there ya go
2013-06-30 20:06:02	TheShazbot	a ridiculously huge laptop though
2013-06-30 20:06:21	TheShazbot	although it may not be any bigger than mine
2013-06-30 20:06:29	clarkb	I am a fan of having a desktop for gaming, compiling and so on then having a cheap netbook like laptop
2013-06-30 20:06:52	Wren	oh, I hadn't noticed the screen size
2013-06-30 20:07:16	TheShazbot	clarkb: I had that, until my netbook croaked
2013-06-30 20:07:28	clarkb	because I prefer gaming on a desktop with real peripherals and like my portable machines to be portable
2013-06-30 20:07:57	TheShazbot	so I figured I'd just get a new machine entirely instead of spending money to upgrade my desktop, which is technically obsolete
2013-06-30 20:15:22	Wren	What would people consider "decent" resolution for 15"?
2013-06-30 20:18:57	clarkb	anyone watch Hit & Miss? Just read the description on Netflix and feel like I must watch it now
2013-06-30 20:19:07	Wren	Honestly, so far it looks like the best deal for a high-resolution display is the y500 on lenovo's website.
2013-06-30 20:21:26	TheShazbot	1600x900 is what I would say is decrnt
2013-06-30 20:23:39	Wren	Yeah, the one I'm eyeing the second one: http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/y-series/y500/
2013-06-30 20:23:53	Wren	1920x1080 at 15"
2013-06-30 20:24:08	TheShazbot	the same one that Lycopene and I have, yeah
2013-06-30 20:24:30	TheShazbot	I can't say I don't recommend it. it's a great machine
2013-06-30 20:28:49	bkero	y500 is gaming goodness, but honestly if you get a machine with haswell and you dont mind not having 1080p, you can get away with intel graphics
2013-06-30 20:29:00	bkero	which is cheaper, better battery life, and lighter weight
2013-06-30 20:33:20	Wren	bkero: Can that handle SC2?
2013-06-30 20:34:56	Wren	I mean, my 2007 MBP was playing 1080p video and it would be nice to keep that.
2013-06-30 20:35:42	bkero	Wren: nibalizer's MBA can do it at 1366x768
2013-06-30 20:36:18	bkero	haswell should be 15-50% faster, and get some cpu with a higher clockspeed and it's even more gravy
2013-06-30 20:36:46	Wren	Huh. That would probably be all right then.
2013-06-30 20:37:05	Wren	Man, it's been so long sense I've had to care about computer specs.
2013-06-30 20:40:14	bkero	Get the haswell
2013-06-30 20:40:45	bkero	We can get your MBP up and running in the mean time.
2013-06-30 20:41:13	Wren	If we get it up and running I probably won't need a new laptop after all.
2013-06-30 20:41:57	greghaynes	idea pads seem to not last long
2013-06-30 20:42:09	greghaynes	just physically they seem to fall apart
2013-06-30 20:42:23	greghaynes	also, topic?
2013-06-30 20:44:13	retrov	Wren: if 1080p is too much to get a decent framerate, i usually run the game windowed at a lower res
2013-06-30 20:44:18	retrov	means you can still watch IRC :)

2013-06-30 20:51:44	TheShazbot	Well, I have had it for a few months, it's been pretty good. most of my gripes are caused by me
2013-06-30 20:52:32	bkero	Were those easy to cause?
2013-06-30 20:52:51	TheShazbot	the upgrading is pretty simple, and you can put in a second ssd drive (mssd) as well as another
2013-06-30 20:53:11	TheShazbot	no, it has been mostly software-based
2013-06-30 20:53:40	TheShazbot	efi can be a pain, and windows 7 is supported by drivers
2013-06-30 20:53:57	TheShazbot	so you can use something besides win 8
2013-06-30 20:59:18	bkero	Have to modify the bios to add the pci id to use the msata ssd?
2013-06-30 20:59:45	bkero	I had to do that in my x220 to use the second wireless card, wasn't on Lenovo's bullshit pci-e whitelist

2013-07-01 00:23:39	Wren	Anybody used HP laptops?
2013-07-01 00:24:31	nightfly	I've used low-end ones.
2013-07-01 00:25:43	nightfly	You can still expect to get a few years use out their cheaper products.
2013-07-01 00:26:15	nightfly	I'd probably still be going that route if I didn't really that portability mattered way more to me than performance.
2013-07-01 00:26:42	bkero	the glossy wrist rests always bothered me
2013-07-01 00:27:03	bkero	I've never seen a clean version of those low-end HPs

2013-07-01 00:28:16	bkero	How much does it cost if you bump it up to 1080p?
2013-07-01 00:28:25	kini	build quality is totally different
2013-07-01 00:28:52	Wren	$50 gets me 1920x1080
2013-07-01 00:28:59	Wren	Is that 1080p?
2013-07-01 00:29:01	bkero	yes
2013-07-01 00:29:07	bkero	and the geforce is another $70
2013-07-01 00:29:21	bkero	If it's an option I wouldn't recommend not getting it
2013-07-01 00:29:47	bkero	and that puts it at same price as lenovo...see if you can get a student discount on these actually.
2013-07-01 00:30:04	Wren	So that would total out to $770
2013-07-01 00:31:19	Wren	bkero: you recommend I select both options?
2013-07-01 00:31:23	bkero	Yeah
2013-07-01 00:31:30	bkero	You'd regret if you didn't get them
2013-07-01 00:31:33	nibalizer	mac book air!
2013-07-01 00:31:34	nibalizer	wooo
2013-07-01 00:31:39	Wren	no
2013-07-01 00:31:41	nibalizer	 /troll
2013-07-01 00:31:46	Wren	I am done with apple products
2013-07-01 00:31:51	bkero	Wren: that's dangerously close to the price of a Y510 though
2013-07-01 00:31:52	nibalizer	its actaully the perfect computer
2013-07-01 00:31:55	Wren	Well, I'm done with apple
2013-07-01 00:32:05	bkero	nibalizer: not for playing games :P Or good battery life. Or Linux.
2013-07-01 00:32:08	nightfly	Any reason why>
2013-07-01 00:32:47	nightfly	(the no apple thing)
2013-07-01 00:33:32	Wren	Well, one is Apple the company seems kinda douchey, but mainly they are overpriced.
2013-07-01 00:34:04	Wren	They make good quality stuff and I like their emphasis on design, but they aren't worth the cost
2013-07-01 00:34:09	Wren	Especially for me.
2013-07-01 00:34:18	nightfly	Agree on the douchey bit
2013-07-01 00:34:42	nightfly	http://shop.lenovo.com/portlandstate/us/en/laptops/?redir=y
2013-07-01 00:34:44	Wren	Lenovo sells their entry level y410p for $800, but no hd graphics
2013-07-01 00:35:34	retrov	Wren: any reason for the ideapad vs the thinkpad?
2013-07-01 00:35:49	Wren	no reason. Spot a good thinkpad?
2013-07-01 00:35:57	bkero	They're a bit more expensive
2013-07-01 00:36:04	Wren	Ideapads?
2013-07-01 00:36:06	Wren	or thinkpads?
2013-07-01 00:36:10	bkero	Thinkpads
2013-07-01 00:36:36	retrov	Wren: http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x230/?sb=:00000025:00003332:
2013-07-01 00:36:42	retrov	don't know if you want to spend that much though
2013-07-01 00:36:53	bkero	That one is going to be replaced within the month
2013-07-01 00:36:54	retrov	IPS screen tho
2013-07-01 00:37:06	Wren	"WCI HTML is not valid"
2013-07-01 00:37:17	bkero	All the thinkpads are going to be Haswell-ified and go under a complete redesign within the next month. I can't really advocate anybody buying one right now.
2013-07-01 00:38:08	Wren	nightfly: how did you find that PSU link?
2013-07-01 00:38:30	greghaynes	yeaaa, id wait on buying any lenovos
2013-07-01 00:38:39	bkero	greghaynes: the Y series Ideapad was already updated
2013-07-01 00:38:46	greghaynes	still
2013-07-01 00:39:08	Wren	Partly
2013-07-01 00:39:16	bkero	If you're looking for a Y510, why wait?
2013-07-01 00:39:35	Wren	Well, I'm not looking for one in particular.
2013-07-01 00:39:35	greghaynes	I guess if theres some reason you want that
2013-07-01 00:39:56	bkero	Definitely hold off on the thinkpads
2013-07-01 00:40:07	Wren	I really just want a machine that will last and can play starcraft (on low graphics at the very least)
2013-07-01 00:40:41	bkero	Your 2007 MBP can't do it at 800x600 on low quality?
2013-07-01 00:40:42	greghaynes	then I wouldnt get a non lenovo or mbp
2013-07-01 00:40:44	Wren	The haswell would be nice going forward, and as bkero said it would be lighter if I could ditch the dedicated graphics
2013-07-01 00:40:50	Wren	bkero: It does.
2013-07-01 00:41:01	Wren	Well, it actually does higher res than that.
2013-07-01 00:41:02	greghaynes	those are the only two machines ive experienced lasting
2013-07-01 00:41:16	Wren	But it starts to have trouble when large numbers of units show up.
2013-07-01 00:41:16	greghaynes	s/lenovo/thinkpad
2013-07-01 00:41:20	nibalizer	mba gives no fucks
2013-07-01 00:41:26	bkero	You can also get thinkpad parts on eBay for if anything breaks
2013-07-01 00:41:29	 *	nibalizer hugs mba
2013-07-01 00:41:38	bkero	for under $$$
2013-07-01 00:41:40	nibalizer	best experience i've ever had with a cumper
2013-07-01 00:41:42	retrov	nibalizer: what vintage was yours?
2013-07-01 00:41:52	retrov	sandy bridge? or the ones before?
2013-07-01 00:41:52	greghaynes	im amazed you like that hing
2013-07-01 00:41:54	nibalizer	like a week after they were announced in 2011
2013-07-01 00:41:58	nibalizer	yea sandy bridge
2013-07-01 00:42:11	nibalizer	i've had some hate for it
2013-07-01 00:42:11	nibalizer	but
2013-07-01 00:42:17	nibalizer	since i know im getting a haswell X1

2013-07-01 00:42:36	bkero	I hope haswell x1 fixes the battery life
2013-07-01 00:42:38	greghaynes	I think a large number of nerds are getting that machine
2013-07-01 00:42:50	nibalizer	i seriously could use this computer for the rest of my life if i HAD too
2013-07-01 00:42:58	TheShazbot	do it
2013-07-01 00:43:01	nibalizer	no
2013-07-01 00:43:08	bkero	until Apple stops giving you OS updates :P
2013-07-01 00:43:11	Wren	nibalizer: Does your MBA started dropping tons of frames in big games?
2013-07-01 00:43:12	TheShazbot	I really want an mba
2013-07-01 00:43:13	nibalizer	lawl

2013-07-01 00:43:36	kini	you can run linux on a macbook air if you want
2013-07-01 00:43:46	bkero	kini: I dare you to try it daily.
2013-07-01 00:43:46	nibalizer	you can
2013-07-01 00:43:46	greghaynes	dont let him tell you his mba sc2's without issue
2013-07-01 00:43:51	nibalizer	haha
2013-07-01 00:43:54	kini	bkero: bart does it
2013-07-01 00:43:55	greghaynes	but I hear haswell is pretty powerful at that
2013-07-01 00:43:57	TheShazbot	nibalizer: I would do a straight across trade, my lenovo for your mba
2013-07-01 00:44:12	kini	he finally got rid of that tiny thing with the circular touchpad
2013-07-01 00:44:19	nibalizer	lol
2013-07-01 00:44:20	kini	now he has a macbook air with debian on it
2013-07-01 00:44:21	greghaynes	kini: he got mba?
2013-07-01 00:44:22	bkero	kini: Aww, got rid of his toughbook? :(

2013-07-01 00:44:35	nibalizer	nice
2013-07-01 00:44:37	kini	not like he went out of his way to buy a macbook lol
2013-07-01 00:44:40	kini	retrov: nope
2013-07-01 00:44:47	bkero	I have one of those Japanese netbooks. Panasonic CF-R6.
2013-07-01 00:44:50	kini	not since spring term of this year
2013-07-01 00:44:52	bkero	Best build quality of any laptop I've ever used.
2013-07-01 00:44:57	nibalizer	bart doesn't have the full widescreen on
2013-07-01 00:45:01	nibalizer	he has it in RMS mode

2013-07-01 00:45:15	Wren	My MBP is from 2007 and has NVIDIA graphics and can only run SC2 on the lowest settings
2013-07-01 00:45:18	kini	what do you mean RMS mode lol
2013-07-01 00:45:21	Wren	Core 2 Duo
2013-07-01 00:45:31	Wren	kini: Circular Trackpad? What model is that
2013-07-01 00:45:36	bkero	Wren: using those old shitty OS X nVidia drivers?
2013-07-01 00:45:42	Wren	...sure?
2013-07-01 00:45:42	bkero	Or are you rebooting into winders?
2013-07-01 00:45:48	Wren	No, using OS x
2013-07-01 00:45:59	bkero	Yeah...Apple doesn't update those often, if at all
2013-07-01 00:46:07	Wren	http://support.apple.com/kb/sp13 Doesn't specify whether they are shitty or not.
2013-07-01 00:46:11	kini	Wren: <bkero> <3 CF-R[1-9]
2013-07-01 00:46:29	bkero	kini: I'm pissed they don't make modern versions, or I would totally get work to give me one of those.
2013-07-01 00:47:30	bkero	kini: It's 999g. Super lightweight. And bulletproof.
2013-07-01 00:47:36	Wren	I saw a laptop at freegeek with a semi-circular trackpad. Stupidest thing I've ever seen
2013-07-01 00:47:47	bkero	Wren: You can 'jog' to scroll like an old ipod
2013-07-01 00:47:50	kini	bkero: yeah my boss in singapore had one too
2013-07-01 00:47:56	kini	oddly enough
2013-07-01 00:48:33	kini	er, meaning, because Bart is my new boss (I was doing grading for him part-time last term)
2013-07-01 00:48:42	bkero	Should ask why he swapped it out
2013-07-01 00:50:15	Wren	Ahh, yes: http://imgur.com/2NI78dV
2013-07-01 00:50:27	bkero	Wren: should ask /b/ what laptop you should buy

2013-07-01 12:41:44	Corbin	As a coworker put it, there are three kinds of free.
2013-07-01 12:41:47	Corbin	Free as in beer...

2013-07-02 13:40:04	kini	why the heck would anyone even want that
2013-07-02 13:40:12	TheShazbot	why not
2013-07-02 13:40:18	greghaynes	kini is typing
2013-07-02 13:40:23	edunham	to be a creepy stalker and go "why aren't you talking to meeeee?"?
2013-07-02 13:40:28	TheShazbot	for all those times I type in something dumb
2013-07-02 13:40:39	TheShazbot	and then realize "that's not really appropriate" and delete it
2013-07-02 13:41:10	kini	like it's some kind of weird attempt at making IRC more like face to face conversation, I guess...?
2013-07-02 13:41:14	kini	but just imagine if people talked like that
2013-07-02 13:41:27	kini	you look at the other person, they are staring at you with their mouth closed but their cheeks are starting to bulge
2013-07-02 13:41:35	kini	you're like "OK, they're typing..."
2013-07-02 13:41:52	kini	their cheeks seem to have stopped expanding "oh, they stopped typing. Dammit why did they stop typing!"
2013-07-02 13:42:00	kini	the cheeks continue to expand "Oh they're typing again!"
2013-07-02 13:42:09	kini	suddenly their mouth opens and a sentence springs forth fully formed
2013-07-02 13:42:14	kini	wtf kind of imagery is this lol
2013-07-02 13:42:34	kini	I'd much rather imagine that we're sending extremely short letters to each other
2013-07-02 13:43:51	@cbeck	Dear sir, lololol ur mom. Yours, cbeck
2013-07-02 13:44:16	TheShazbot	dear cbeck, xoxo
2013-07-02 13:44:41	@cbeck	Dear everything, why ar eyou terrible
2013-07-02 13:46:48	Corbin	Dear Screwtape, hv u seen my blk jcket? need 4 tonit kthx. cn u pick up food 4 bbq 2? cyl, Your Uncle Wormwood.
2013-07-02 13:47:39	Corbin	I recognize that this joke is possibly above some heads, but c'mon.
2013-07-02 13:48:31	@cbeck	<3
2013-07-02 13:49:03	Corbin	I still think that Screwtape Letters should be required reading at the college level.
2013-07-02 13:49:28	Corbin	Mostly because one of my exes was hilariously upset that I had CS Lewis on my bookshelf. She was so annoyed that I thought that he was worth reading.
2013-07-02 13:49:45	@cbeck	I read it as a teenager
2013-07-02 13:50:02	Corbin	As did I. I didn't get it at first, but then I did.
2013-07-02 13:50:06	@cbeck	Not a huge fan, but it's worth reading
2013-07-02 13:50:25	TheShazbot	hilariously upset is the best upset
2013-07-02 13:50:54	Corbin	Well, at the time, I cared about her opinions, so I tried to appease her by claiming that I was actually an atheist and that I was reading it ironically.
2013-07-02 13:51:13	Corbin	Worked well enough. It helps that people assume that CS guys are atheist.
2013-07-02 13:56:30	TheShazbot	atheism, heh
2013-07-02 13:56:40	TheShazbot	religion doesn't matter.
2013-07-02 13:56:53	TheShazbot	whatever helps you cope in the world and exist
2013-07-02 13:57:31	Corbin	It might surprise you to know that that's not why everybody is religious.
2013-07-02 13:58:53	TheShazbot	I'm aware
2013-07-02 14:00:41	TheShazbot	needing something to believe in, a purpose in life
2013-07-02 14:00:54	TheShazbot	each to their own
2013-07-02 14:02:20	Corbin	Some religions exist because they believe that they need to record evidence of the divine.
2013-07-02 14:02:30	Corbin	And some religions exist because they choose to spite divinity.
2013-07-02 14:03:03	Corbin	Consider a comparative values & beliefs class; I'm sure that PSU offers it and it would be a good pickup if you're in need of core credits.
2013-07-02 14:03:34	TheShazbot	All I have left are CS and math. that's it
2013-07-02 14:03:46	TheShazbot	no real interest regardless
2013-07-02 14:05:25	clarkb	speaking of CS Lewis, at the EMP they have some of Tolkiens original planning manuscript stuff for the LoTR. Pretty impressive to see his timeline charts
2013-07-02 14:54:09	kini	<tgies> under the patriot act internet service providers can be subpoenaed Secretly and it's unlawful for them to tell you that such a subpoena has been delivered
2013-07-02 14:54:09	kini	<tgies> but there's nothing that says you can't, like, post something every day you HAVEN'T received a subpoena
2013-07-02 14:54:09	kini	<tgies> several providers are doing this now evidently, let's see if it holds up in court
2013-07-02 14:54:09	kini	<tgies> "warrant canary"
2013-07-02 14:54:09	kini	awesome
2013-07-02 14:54:55	clarkb	google is also suing to be allowed to report subpoena info iirc

2013-07-06 16:22:17	lewisrjc	I am staring at the asm now trying to see what
2013-07-06 16:22:26	kini	I mean did you control for branch prediction
2013-07-06 16:22:58	kini	did you feed in a bunch of random pairs half of which were equal and half of which weren't
2013-07-06 16:24:11	kini	or did you just feed in a bunch of random pairs (which of course would be almost all not equal)
2013-07-06 16:24:11	kini	if the latter, maybe it's that gcc -O0 produces code for "if (condition) then {}" that gives branch prediction hints for the condition being false, or something
2013-07-06 16:24:46	kini	no I guess that's silly
2013-07-06 16:24:58	kini	why would -O0 be doing branch prediction hints
2013-07-06 16:25:33	lewisrjc	my guess is this is an artifiact of the processor I am using
2013-07-06 16:25:58	lewisrjc	since the code is just myfunc(a, b) == myotherfunc(c,d) ? 3 : 4
2013-07-06 16:26:04	lewisrjc	vs != instead of ==
2013-07-06 16:26:18	lewisrjc	but it's still odd, and it's like a factor of 2 off as well
2013-07-06 16:27:02	lewisrjc	my suspicion is that at O0 It just uses whatever order it's given, which is correct for one way and wrong for another for branch predicition

2014-07-16 20:49:35	sabreman	it's such a cool language
2014-07-16 21:50:18	pilgrimd	"PSU doesn't teach languages, it teaches theory. You're expect to learn languages as a matter of course."  <--- paraphrasing multiple CS faculty and nearly quoting the Chair.
2014-07-16 21:52:42	@kennobaka	tl;dr: because, Accreditation
2014-07-16 21:53:20	pilgrimd	kennobaka: I call BS.  Other schools have no issue maintaining accreditation while offering tutorial classes.
2014-07-16 21:54:38	pilgrimd	sabreman: FWIW, PCC has classes that directly teach several different languages, particularly C#, as part of their computer systems tech programs. Most of them have no hard prereqs.
2014-07-16 21:56:11	pilgrimd	sabreman: And the benefit of PCC is you get ex-industry folk doing the instruction, so you don't have to deal with the severe cases of academic craniorectal inversion disorder common to a disturbing number of CS dept faculty.
2014-07-16 21:59:55	@kennobaka	but is PCC accreditated for giving out CS degrees?
2014-07-16 22:00:25	pilgrimd	kennobaka: No, PCC doesn't have any four-year programs.
2014-07-16 22:00:45	@kennobaka	the reason I've heard is that teaching a language is verboten because it's a trade skill, rather than an academic pursuit
2014-07-16 22:01:12	Krampus	kennobaka: gwuh?
2014-07-16 22:01:13	pilgrimd	But in the (IMO foolhardy) absence of useful tutorial classes at PSU, I was suggesting PCC's classes, which actually are quite good at teaching specific languages.
2014-07-16 22:01:29	Krampus	kennobaka: like PSU can't teach a language because PCC says "that's a trade skill?"
2014-07-16 22:01:49	@kennobaka	nono, because $accreditation_organization says "that's a trade skill"
2014-07-16 22:02:04	@kennobaka	It's always been a nebulous "they" who say PSU can't do it
2014-07-16 22:02:12	pilgrimd	kennobaka: Pretty much.  PSU isn't a trade school.  Yet I can't tell you how many classes I've been in where I've seen people drop literally because the don't know the language being used for the course and the prof provided zero allowance for that.
2014-07-16 22:02:21	Krampus	kennobaka: "You know what else is a trade skill?  Eating a giant bag of dicks."
2014-07-16 22:02:49	pilgrimd	kennobaka: Ok, so don't offer it as part of the CS curriculum, offer it as a non-credit course.
2014-07-16 22:03:47	pilgrimd	Krampus: That's a trade skill that would likely prove useful.  As I understanding, knowing how to eat a dick is a key component of effective progression through grad school.
2014-07-16 22:03:53	pilgrimd	*understand it
2014-07-16 22:04:45	@kennobaka	pilgrimd: that's why there used to be the Super Sekret C Course
2014-07-16 22:05:18	@kennobaka	I think it was technically just a bunch of students getting together for a "study group" where one person happened to know C and the others didn't
2014-07-16 22:05:43	Krampus	pilgrimd: I have managed to get through grad school thus far without suffering from, as the german's call it, "Ruteluften."  Although I'm confused with how some people continue in the programs.
2014-07-16 22:05:53	pyro	surely the language any theory is expressed in is a crucial part of the theory? One has to know what expressions are well-formed. And the language one works in affects the proofs or thoughts that are expressable
2014-07-16 22:06:20	pilgrimd	pyro: To a degree, yes, but you also simply need to know your way around the language.
2014-07-16 22:07:10	pilgrimd	pyro: For example, if you come up through the 1xx courses, literally by faculty lottery you will have learned any subset of C, C++ and Java.
2014-07-16 22:07:40	pilgrimd	And when you get to 2xx, you're expected to know all three regardless of what your exposure was in the 1xx courses.
2014-07-16 22:08:05	pilgrimd	But NO ONE, not even your CS advisor, will tell you that.
2014-07-16 22:08:10	retrov	pilgrimd: in my case, i got python, C++ and java out of 161-3 and 202
2014-07-16 22:08:38	pyro	the first part sounds reasonable different courses are better in different languages. the next part sounds like a problem. prerequisites arn't specified properly
2014-07-16 22:09:05	 *	pilgrimd organized a C++ crash courses braindump style in 202 because half the class only knew Java.
2014-07-16 22:09:06	retrov	is karlaf the only one who teaches 202?
2014-07-16 22:09:14	pilgrimd	retrov: No
2014-07-16 22:09:45	retrov	pilgrimd: that's weird about only knowing java in 202. i had karlaf for that course and we did c++ before java
2014-07-16 22:09:51	retrov	is it specific to the instructor?
2014-07-16 22:10:02	pilgrimd	retrov: Yes, the faculty can choose the language (within reason).

2014-07-16 22:33:30	retrov	the coffee-machine function should probably take a vector

2014-07-17 09:17:02	alevar	Krampus: I forget the prof's name, but he dunked his CS 163 students straight into Haskell with barely any introduction before going into the meat of the course.

2014-07-17 09:18:16	alevar	It really indicates how much of a clusterfuck it was that it is still well remembered.
2014-07-17 09:18:58	alevar	A fellow student who is quite decent in CS dropped the course. She just couldn't reasonably keep up, given the lack of an introduction.

2014-07-17 09:26:38	+askore	well, apparently when he taught cs161 a few terms ago people struggled to keep up for the first few weeks until he caught on an slowed the course down
2014-07-17 09:26:56	alevar	I discussed that with him.
2014-07-17 09:27:19	+askore	but at least it wasn't in haskell, yeah :)
2014-07-17 09:27:26	alevar	Apparently it's partially a matter of 161 having, in his words, "many masters".

2014-07-21 22:48:11	Krampus	so i need a program that can generate a static call graph from C++ source to precisely detail how fucked up it is.  Suggestions?
2014-07-21 22:50:05	alevar	Krampus: Does it include unnecessary and confusing use of macros?
2014-07-21 22:51:07	Krampus	alevar: yes, but it also has a lot of cross-project calls and interleaving.
2014-07-21 22:52:06	Krampus	Basically I want to confirm my suspiscion that it'll looks like a CT scan of endometriosis.
2014-07-21 22:53:24	alevar	I... I... was just kidding
2014-07-21 22:53:39	alevar	What monster would use macros in C++?
2014-07-21 22:56:01	Krampus	At this point i am simply reporting and repairing.

2014-07-21 23:16:58	Krampus	kennobaka: C++ is awesome, provided you have someone that understands OOP writing the code.
2014-07-21 23:44:46	alevar	kennobaka: Don't you write perl?

2014-07-21 23:47:23	@kennobaka	I haven't written Perl in days
2014-07-21 23:47:31	@kennobaka	full disclosure: this weekend was a 3-day weekend
2014-07-21 23:48:25	Krampus	That's like saying "I've taken the weekend off raping!"
2014-07-21 23:48:49	nightfly	not the most tasteful analogy
2014-07-21 23:49:28	Krampus	I know, it's about as absurdly inappropriate as I could go. :)
2014-07-21 23:49:28	alevar	nightfly: I agree, perl is more serious than that
2014-07-21 23:49:41	alevar	s/more serious/worse/
2014-07-21 23:50:04	Krampus	*ahem* "It's like shooting down a passenger plane full of AIDS researchers and blaming it on the country you invaded!"
2014-07-21 23:51:06	alevar	You need to work killing children in there somewhere.
2014-07-21 23:51:09	 *	Krampus will admit perl is very powerful;  He's just seen many bad things done in it.
2014-07-21 23:51:17	Krampus	alevar: ...oh, they did. :(  Way to go, downer.
2014-07-21 23:51:24	nightfly	Krampus: Pick something more realistic, nobody would ever do that /s
2014-07-21 23:52:22	alevar	I wonder if we'll ever really know what happened to that plane.
2014-07-21 23:52:27	Krampus	nightfly: writing in perl?
2014-07-21 23:52:46	Krampus	alevar: i dunno, the media story doesn't seem that hard to believe for once.
2014-07-21 23:52:48	nightfly	alevar: There was a removed tweet that indicated that somebody thought it was a military cargo plane
2014-07-21 23:53:11	Krampus	cargo full of SPIES.
2014-07-21 23:53:18	alevar	exactly what, as opposed to generally what
2014-07-21 23:54:18	alevar	I have serious doubts that Russia will ever do anything to release details.
2014-07-21 23:54:40	nightfly	Yup, it's doubtful we will ever know for sure

2014-07-21 23:57:05	alevar	I was discussing this with rattboi. UTi isn't terribly into OSS, so he doesn't see them sending people to OSCON any time soon, if ever.
2014-07-21 23:58:00	alevar	There's a chance that I could make it to a couple of days next year, but I don't have any days off built up at this time.
2014-07-22 00:01:36	nightfly	You can probably get a bit of time in after work if you wanted. I think the booth crawl thing is in the early evening tomorrow
2014-07-22 00:02:58	alevar	How would that help me?
2014-07-22 00:03:17	alevar	(Swag isn't help. I don't need more things)
2014-07-22 00:04:17	nightfly	Well, you can talk to the vendors. I had an interesting but brief conversation with a guy in the Maria DB booth about the effect Oracle had on Sun's old projects.
2014-07-22 00:05:01	nightfly	So the booth's are useful for more than just stuff (though I intend to get as much stuff as I can)
2014-07-22 00:06:04	nightfly	And people are very eager to hire, the Craigslist people made it sound like they are constantly looking for good people (who are willing to relocate to San Francisco, which excludes me right now).
2014-07-22 00:16:43	@kennobaka	alevar: nonsense! You always need more things!
2014-07-22 00:17:23	@kennobaka	have the Craigslist people tried just putting an ad in Craigslist?

2014-07-22 21:09:41	clarkb	the profs and material were good. jenks and bohnaker and geiger
2014-07-22 21:10:10	eidolon	my experience was that the people who most voraciously attacked the whole setup were the ones who wanted university to be as expedient a path possible to a white collar job
2014-07-22 21:10:10	clarkb	and I am currently employed as a result of capstone
2014-07-22 21:10:30	Epitrope	clarkb: what was your major?
2014-07-22 21:10:31	clarkb	oh and ross
2014-07-22 21:10:34	clarkb	CS
2014-07-22 21:10:35	eidolon	and uh, I'd like them to fuck off and go to a diploma mill if that's what they're after
2014-07-22 21:11:11	clarkb	Iade great friends in frinq
2014-07-22 21:11:21	Epitrope	do the people who attack unst tend to also attack capstone?
2014-07-22 21:11:29	Epitrope	I have those as very separate things in my head
2014-07-22 21:11:33	clarkb	capstone == unst
2014-07-22 21:11:36	clarkb	so yes
2014-07-22 21:12:03	Epitrope	I thought university studies == freshman inquiry + sophomore inquiry + junior cluster courses
2014-07-22 21:12:10	@krinkle	well capstone for CS majors is pretty different from capstone for most other majors
2014-07-22 21:12:11	clarkb	unst is 4 years of education. frinq sinq junior cluster and capstone
2014-07-22 21:12:24	clarkb	epitrope it includes capstone
2014-07-22 21:12:35	Epitrope	ah
2014-07-22 21:13:09	clarkb	krinkle that is true
2014-07-22 21:13:10	Epitrope	well, I haven't heard any complaints about capstone, cs or otherwise
2014-07-22 21:13:31	clarkb	epitrope if you do honors you write a thesis instead
2014-07-22 21:13:48	Epitrope	clarkb: there is more than one "honors"
2014-07-22 21:13:53	clarkb	and dont do the other unst
2014-07-22 21:14:08	Epitrope	but yes, I know people who have done that
2014-07-22 21:14:08	clarkb	huh when I was there it was a single program
2014-07-22 21:14:20	Epitrope	there's the honors program that eg Kona went through
2014-07-22 21:14:34	Epitrope	there is a CS honors course where you do a supervised research project
2014-07-22 21:14:45	Epitrope	and then there are latin honors, which are just based on GPA
2014-07-22 21:15:22	ryan	Epitrope, how many times can I put honors on my degree?
2014-07-22 21:15:23	clarkb	so the kona thing is unst substitute
2014-07-22 21:15:30	ryan	:P
2014-07-22 21:15:32	Epitrope	clarkb: yes
2014-07-22 21:15:32	clarkb	the others dont replace unst
2014-07-22 21:15:41	Epitrope	ryan: at least three
2014-07-22 21:15:48	ryan	heh, good answer.
2014-07-22 21:15:51	clarkb	and is geared towards students that go to grad school
2014-07-22 21:16:05	clarkb	kona: out of curiousity did it help?
2014-07-22 21:16:14	Epitrope	right
2014-07-22 21:16:42	clarkb	I am guessing the thesis/research stuff would help
2014-07-22 21:16:54	clarkb	just to prep for doing it again
2014-07-22 21:16:59	Epitrope	I think she has said it was helpful
2014-07-22 21:17:03	ryan	clarkb, you writeup your capstone unless you're in CS honors too.
2014-07-22 21:17:12	ryan	(I think)
2014-07-22 21:17:23	clarkb	ryan you dont
2014-07-22 21:17:25	Epitrope	and allowed her to breeze through early grad classes
2014-07-22 21:17:34	Epitrope	ryan: I didn't; I just had to present at the end
2014-07-22 21:17:41	clarkb	ryan you deliver a thing
2014-07-22 21:17:51	Epitrope	and take (and then turn in) notes in a journal all through
2014-07-22 21:17:53	ryan	clarkb, sorry, I meant in the univerisity honors.
2014-07-22 21:17:56	clarkb	that is idealy an implementation of some idea
2014-07-22 21:18:23	ryan	in university honors, if you are a CS student, you just write up your capstone, unless you are in department honors, in which case you do real research.
2014-07-22 21:18:24	clarkb	and are graded on the process of getting there
2014-07-22 21:18:45	clarkb	oh I see
2014-07-22 21:19:13	Epitrope	ryan++ interesting; I've wondered how those interact
2014-07-22 21:19:24	clarkb	in any case unst was valuable to me. and I would choose it over gen ed courses that are more traditional
2014-07-22 21:19:31	ryan	but getting CS and Honors advising to talk to each other is fucking hard, so who really knows.
2014-07-22 21:19:42	ryan	I feel like I'll get to graduation day and somebody will tell me I missed some requirement.
2014-07-22 21:19:55	ryan	(so don't quote me)
2014-07-22 21:20:00	clarkb	just check dars thats all they seem to do
2014-07-22 21:20:17	ryan	it says I need special signoff.
2014-07-22 21:20:24	ryan	with unclear explanation.
2014-07-22 21:20:27	clarkb	nice
2014-07-22 21:20:53	Epitrope	ryan: protip: signoffs are attached to your admitting term
2014-07-22 21:21:18	ryan	Epitrope: what do you mean?
2014-07-22 21:21:21	Epitrope	so make sure they attach it to the right term, and then always use that term when running dars or having them run dars
2014-07-22 21:21:33	ryan	ahhhh. thanks!
2014-07-22 21:21:39	clarkb	well you can use any term between now and then
2014-07-22 21:21:51	clarkb	or 7 years ago whichever is more recent
2014-07-22 21:22:04	Epitrope	so if Warren, say, signs off on a different math class counting for your math credit
2014-07-22 21:22:19	Epitrope	and attaches it to you being admitted fall 2013
2014-07-22 21:22:35	Epitrope	and then you run a dars report with an admission date of winter 2014
2014-07-22 21:22:36	Epitrope	it won't show up
2014-07-22 21:22:53	ryan	hm, I wonder if they figure out the right date if I was admitted in 10th grade too..
2014-07-22 21:23:12	ryan	I feel like that increases likelyhood of confusion.
2014-07-22 21:23:14	Epitrope	(I had a brief moment of panic when Barbara ran my dars wrong and didn't see me as being ready to graduate)
2014-07-22 21:23:41	ryan	Epitrope: odd question, but did you ever get an advisor besides Barbara?
2014-07-22 21:23:43	Epitrope	ryan: yeah, that might be worth spending some time to be super clear about
2014-07-22 21:23:49	Epitrope	ryan: nope
2014-07-22 21:23:51	ryan	supposedly we are supposed to have those things.
2014-07-22 21:24:02	ryan	Barbara just doesn't get much time to assign them. :)
2014-07-22 21:24:07	ryan	so they don't get assigned.
2014-07-22 21:24:10	Epitrope	oh huh, interesting
2014-07-22 21:24:15	ryan	ikr!
2014-07-22 21:24:27	ryan	Epitrope++ now I know not to expect one :P
2014-07-22 21:24:34	clarkb	they send you an email about it when you get admitted to mcecs
2014-07-22 21:24:48	clarkb	but mine was on sabbatical so uh ya
2014-07-22 21:25:17	ryan	clarkb: like "junior year" admitted?
2014-07-22 21:25:22	clarkb	ya
2014-07-22 21:25:26	ryan	yeah, I never got that email either..
2014-07-22 21:25:29	ryan	:P
2014-07-22 21:25:38	clarkb	before that you use normal psu advising
2014-07-22 21:25:49	clarkb	i just read catalog and figured it out
2014-07-22 21:27:56	ryan	Right, well, I'm having trouble picking a research area for my thesis, and it seams like that's exactly the type of problem that the "professor advisor" would be there to help with.
2014-07-22 21:28:38	clarkb	ya. maybe just set up meeting with prof you enjoyed
2014-07-22 21:28:40	 *	ryan is also trying to figure out his whole long term education and career plan, because maybe having a direction to go would clarify a good area to research :P
2014-07-22 21:28:53	ryan	clarkb, good idea, I think I might do that
2014-07-22 21:29:07	Epitrope	your area of research determines the prof (or vice versa)
2014-07-22 21:29:31	ryan	The thing that bothers me about myself, is that I never visit office hours, so I don't really know any :P
2014-07-22 21:29:46	 *	ryan nevers has had a "good reason" to visit office hours
2014-07-22 21:29:52	clarkb	you go to class right?
2014-07-22 21:29:56	Epitrope	now you do
2014-07-22 21:30:00	ryan	clarkb: yes :P
2014-07-22 21:30:01	clarkb	if so they probably know you
2014-07-22 21:30:22	ryan	Epitrope: yeah I think it's interrelated.. chicken and egg :P
2014-07-22 21:30:41	ryan	but yeah
2014-07-22 21:34:21	Epitrope	so Lois for databases, Feng Liu for graphics, Mark Jones for functional languages...
2014-07-22 21:35:31	clarkb	ya but starting with a prof you enjoyed may help you find which of those things you may like
2014-07-22 21:35:44	clarkb	at least in an initial conversation
2014-07-22 21:35:52	Epitrope	ryan: actually, you could just browse the professors' pages on http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/faculty if you want to see research area possibilities
2014-07-22 21:38:25	ryan	I've found the information on the internet to be fairly outdated.
2014-07-22 21:38:52	ryan	but I'm pretty much aware of each professors major research interest at this point, my curiousity has brought me that far, at least :P
2014-07-22 21:44:28	blue	I don't know where to put this... But I'm really happy because I just got told I'm going to IEEE's NSS/MIC/RTSD.
2014-07-22 21:44:39	 *	blue is beyond excited and had to share this news somewhere.
2014-07-22 21:45:37	clarkb	is this a conference? also woo
2014-07-22 21:48:41	alevar	Epitrope: Li for compilers
2014-07-22 21:49:07	blue	It is. It's IEEE's Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference, on Room Temp Semiconductors, X-ray & Gamma detectors.
2014-07-22 21:49:39	blue	It's super fucking interesting and I just got the chance to do technical writing for the Department of Energy at this event. 
2014-07-22 21:50:05	alevar	Do they have laser tag, but with extremely high energy lasers?
2014-07-22 21:50:21	alevar	The type of laser tag where you really, really don't want to be hit
2014-07-22 21:50:22	nightfly	alevar: the keyboardio guy is at OSCon (with a booth/stall thing)
2014-07-22 21:50:39	alevar	sweet!
2014-07-22 21:51:10	alevar	He knows his audience well
2014-07-22 21:51:52	alevar	A bunch of people with who are able and willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money on a keyboard.
2014-07-22 21:51:52	blue	They will talk about LASERs extensively, I expect. lol. Probably in relation to partical accelerators and nuke detection methods. 
2014-07-22 21:52:15	alevar	Screw nuke detection methods
2014-07-22 21:52:20	blue	?
2014-07-22 21:52:21	alevar	How about nuke tag methods?
2014-07-22 21:52:36	alevar	Even more fun than high energy laser tag
2014-07-22 21:52:36	blue	Talk about a game you DONT want to play
2014-07-22 21:52:58	alevar	I could talk about a game that I don't want to play
2014-07-22 21:53:36	alevar	Blue's Clues the video game. I've heard it's too violent.
2014-07-22 21:54:17	blue	Nuke tag sounds a lot like MAD. 
2014-07-22 21:55:20	nightfly	alevar: Heh, yeah. After commenting that the space key is only on the right hand he said the firmware code was available :)
2014-07-22 21:55:45	 *	alevar approves of the space key only being on one hand.
2014-07-22 21:56:02	alevar	Two hands is excessive.
2014-07-22 21:56:30	nightfly	Same here, but I don't think I could get used to doing it with the right hand. I've already got wear markings on mine where I do it with my left hand.
2014-07-22 21:57:23	alevar	Oh. I'm already doing it with my right hand when I'm on my Kinesis. At least for me, the different feeling of different keyboards makes it so that my hands don't get confused.
2014-07-22 21:58:30	blue	The program list (just for the NSS part) alone is making me freak out. in a good way. http://nssmic2014.npss-confs.org/nssmic/NSS.php
2014-07-22 22:00:18	blue	"Astrophysics and space instrumentation" "Semiconductor tracking and spectroscopy" !!! GAH. too exciting!
2014-07-22 22:02:47	Epitrope	alevar: Li for compilers? troll
2014-07-22 22:03:23	alevar	My trolling is bad and I should feel bad, but strangely enough I don't.
2014-07-22 22:04:14	ryan	heh
2014-07-22 22:04:35	ryan	Epitrope, alevar, so what I was saying about outdated info applies to Li.. last publication on http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~li/works.html was:
2014-07-22 22:04:38	nightfly	ryan: You coming/been to OSCon this year?
2014-07-22 22:04:38	ryan	"Usability of Visual Basic for Parallel Programming on Windows NT," (James Barker's Master Thesis), Department of Computer Science, Portland State University, Dec. 1998.
2014-07-22 22:04:54	ryan	nightfly: not yet.. what days do I left to still come?
2014-07-22 22:05:01	Epitrope	it's almost as if people don't want to work with him
2014-07-22 22:05:17	Epitrope	but surely that can't be the case; it must simply be that he has not updated his website in many years
2014-07-22 22:05:55	nightfly	ryan: Ummm, expo halls open until 5:00pm Tomorrow
2014-07-22 22:06:04	nightfly	I think it's the last day for htat
2014-07-22 22:06:17	ryan	Epitrope: for some reason I thought professors had to publish every X years
2014-07-22 22:06:36	ryan	nightfly: dang, I need to try harder then :P
2014-07-22 22:06:49	Epitrope	ryan: that could be
2014-07-22 22:07:11	nightfly	ryan: Yes! There is some good free stuff to be had and lots of interesting people to meet.
2014-07-22 22:08:18	ryan	cool
2014-07-22 22:13:57	Epitrope	so, it's fairly probable that this is a result of me not knowing how to search for publications, but I'm not finding anything by Li this decade
2014-07-22 22:16:37	Epitrope	http://scholar.google.com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/scholar?q=author:Jingke+author:Li&as_ylo=2000
2014-07-22 22:23:30	@kennobaka	clarkb: I don't get this compilers thing; does Li teach it or something?
2014-07-22 22:23:47	Epitrope	he does
2014-07-22 22:24:17	 *	kennobaka doesn't recall
2014-07-22 22:25:13	clarkb	kennobaka wasnt it a history class or something?

2014-07-23 10:47:32	alevar	Then of course in person meetings, which have to be scheduled far in advance. There's basically no way to do casual conversation between teams.

2014-07-23 22:03:03	Epitrope	ooh, nice
2014-07-23 22:03:28	clarkb	Krampus: I do that about once a month. I recommend it
2014-07-23 22:03:29	ryan	I think it's probably outdated, though. :P
2014-07-23 22:03:42	Epitrope	why do you think that?
2014-07-23 22:03:57	ryan	because retired professor (Brown) is listed.
2014-07-23 22:04:20	ryan	and newish professor (Wright) is missing.
2014-07-23 22:04:27	Epitrope	those are good reasons
2014-07-23 22:04:38	ryan	indeed :)
2014-07-23 22:04:45	ryan	but still somewhat accurates for those who are listed!
2014-07-23 22:06:01	Epitrope	interesting that Sheard has Haskell listed but Mark Jones does not
2014-07-23 22:06:33	ryan	I don't know if you've ever taken a class from Sheard... but Sheard lectures definitely include more Haskell than Jones lectures.
2014-07-23 22:06:45	ryan	It seams like... When Sheard likes something, he really likes it.
2014-07-23 22:07:06	ryan	so I can believe it.
2014-07-23 22:07:26	Epitrope	I haven't... but I took Functional Languages with Jones, and that was all Haskell all the time
2014-07-23 22:07:39	ryan	311 should not have Haskell.
2014-07-23 22:07:49	ryan	IMNSHO.
2014-07-23 22:07:50	Epitrope	heh
2014-07-23 22:07:53	clarkb	it should be mosml

2014-07-23 22:08:45	Epitrope	true

2014-07-23 22:32:46	@kennobaka	I liked the 311 I had sans anything functional

2014-07-23 22:39:14	@kennobaka	you can't use UNST to weed out CS majors
2014-07-23 22:39:34	clarkb	dat capstone

2014-07-25 14:16:17	bkero	I see
2014-07-25 14:16:39	mythmon	bkero: the way i deploy corsica is roughly this:   npm install corsica corsica-irc; vim .env; node node_modules/corsica/index.js
2014-07-25 14:17:18	bkero	I see
2014-07-25 14:19:08	mythmon	bkero: and in your .env file, you have  something like  plugins=["foo",....,"corsica-irc"]
2014-07-25 14:20:01	bkero	TypeError: Object ['brain', 'census', 'settings', 'command', 'content', 'timer', 'reset', 'namer', 'glob','corsica-irc'] has no method 'forEach'
2014-07-25 14:20:22	mythmon	what version of node are you using?
2014-07-25 14:20:28	bkero	0.10.25
2014-07-25 14:20:41	mythmon	*blink*
2014-07-25 14:20:56	bkero	Too old?
2014-07-25 14:20:56	mythmon	can i see your .env file?
2014-07-25 14:21:01	mythmon	no, just fine.
2014-07-25 14:21:04	bkero	ubuntu@corsica:~$ cat .env

2014-07-25 14:21:11	mythmon	s/'/"/
2014-07-25 14:21:13	mythmon	it's JSON.
2014-07-25 14:21:21	bkero	I copied/pasted from lib/config.js
2014-07-25 14:21:26	mythmon	yeah, that was a mistake.
2014-07-25 14:21:28	bkero	iAh
2014-07-25 14:21:30	mythmon	since it wasn't valid JSON, it just interpreted it as a string.
2014-07-25 14:21:44	mythmon	in config.js is javascript, which is more forgiving about quotes.
2014-07-25 14:21:57	bkero	fail
2014-07-25 14:22:16	bkero	the leveldb is pretty cool though, although the lack of can-modify-in-plaintext-file makes me sad
2014-07-25 14:22:53	mythmon	well, if you want to write a level backend that stores things in plaintext, that is a totally doable thing.
2014-07-25 14:24:32	bkero	Yeah
2014-07-25 14:24:46	mythmon	in particular, this https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/wiki/Modules#storage
2014-07-25 14:24:58	mythmon	in fact, i notice there is "jsondown"
2014-07-25 14:25:04	mythmon	which should do what you want.

2014-07-25 14:26:53	bkero	mythmon: we finally got two computers and ethernet connections attached to the TVs her ein the PDX office, so we can do this shit now
2014-07-25 14:27:11	mythmon	bkero: what did you tell corsica to make it do that?
2014-07-25 14:27:25	bkero	mythmon: that irc quote on line 1
2014-07-25 14:27:46	mythmon	ah. it isn't quote so clever as you want it to be.
2014-07-25 14:28:00	mythmon	i assume you opened a client with corsica already?
2014-07-25 14:28:05	bkero	yea
2014-07-25 14:28:09	mythmon	open the devtools. it should say "my name is ____"
2014-07-25 14:28:40	mythmon	assuming "Cartoons" is your irc bot, then say "Cartoon: http://slashdot.org screen=____"
2014-07-25 14:29:39	alevar	List<IBuildResult> buildResults = connection.getTeamRepository().itemManager().fetchPartialItems(queryPage.getItemHandles(), IItemManager.DEFAULT, Arrays.asList(properties), connection.getProgressMonitor());
2014-07-25 14:29:50	alevar	Yuck
2014-07-25 14:29:52	mythmon	if opening the devtools is hard, try going to  http://corsica/admin.html
2014-07-25 14:30:02	mythmon	there should be a drop down in there, it will have all the names of the clients.
2014-07-25 14:30:05	 *	bkero has an admin page open
2014-07-25 14:30:16	bkero	I see dakimh-the-enchanter
2014-07-25 14:30:29	mythmon	that checks out as one of the random names.
2014-07-25 14:30:36	bkero	I send messages, although they don't get displayed on the screen
2014-07-25 14:30:46	mythmon	bkero: also, you aren't going to want to use the reset plugin. it's bit rotted, it should not be in the default config. use instead group-reset
2014-07-25 14:30:55	alevar	I see Dakumthou, Destroyer of Worlds
2014-07-25 14:31:01	mythmon	bkero: the devtools might tell you things.
2014-07-25 14:31:56	bkero	I see
2014-07-25 14:32:20	bkero	It seems my client isn't posting anything in the console about receiving messages.
2014-07-25 14:32:40	mythmon	bkero: hmm
2014-07-25 14:32:47	mythmon	but if it got a name, it has talked to the server.
2014-07-25 14:33:03	mythmon	can i see your devtools?
2014-07-25 14:33:32	mythmon	er
2014-07-25 14:33:38	mythmon	pastebin of the console in your devtools.

2014-07-25 14:34:04	bkero	mythmon: the MUD output is pretty fantastic
2014-07-25 14:34:14	mythmon	bkero: that's potch's fault.
2014-07-25 14:34:19	bkero	potch++
2014-07-25 14:36:19	mythmon	bkero: please wait.
2014-07-25 14:36:31	mythmon	bkero: also, did you find the admin page?
2014-07-25 14:36:36	bkero	I did
2014-07-25 14:36:39	mythmon	k
2014-07-25 14:36:42	 *	bkero has had it open the whole time watching the message logs
2014-07-25 14:36:45	mythmon	is there a text box?
2014-07-25 14:36:49	mythmon	and a drop down?
2014-07-25 14:36:55	mythmon	try and select the screen, and type a url there.
2014-07-25 14:36:56	bkero	yup
2014-07-25 14:37:22	bkero	It loads the URL
2014-07-25 14:37:33	bkero	I figured I could type a plaintext message and it would display on the client.
2014-07-25 14:37:40	mythmon	no
2014-07-25 14:37:51	mythmon	you can do  toast text="foo bar"  though
2014-07-25 14:38:14	mythmon	it uses "command syntax"
2014-07-25 14:38:17	mythmon	https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/airmo/Corsica?src=search
2014-07-25 14:39:05	bkero	sure glad I have an LDAP password to see that
2014-07-25 14:39:16	mythmon	yeah.
2014-07-25 14:39:23	mythmon	the docs are bad. i feel bad.
2014-07-25 14:40:15	bkero	IRC bot is a bit rough
2014-07-25 14:40:46	bkero	ircbot: toast text="things" doesn't work, but ircbot: toast text="things screen="salkdjfklasdjfklsadjf" does
2014-07-25 14:40:53	mythmon	yeah
2014-07-25 14:40:56	mythmon	screen is required.
2014-07-25 14:41:04	 *	bkero wishes default would be all screens
2014-07-25 14:41:11	mythmon	write a plugin.
2014-07-25 14:41:21	mythmon	no really, that would be a plugin, and it would be an easy plugin.
2014-07-25 14:41:51	bkero	Maybe I'll ask about that sometime
2014-07-25 14:41:58	bkero	Is there a plugin to rotate web pages?
2014-07-25 14:42:05	mythmon	group-reset
2014-07-25 14:42:10	mythmon	it used to be reset, but you don't want that.
2014-07-25 14:42:27	mythmon	or rather, group-reset handles reset messages, the timer plugin handles the auto-rotation
2014-07-25 14:42:35	mythmon	and then checkout /groups.html
2014-07-25 14:43:05	mythmon	"Search" is a glob, commands can be just urls (screen is not required here)
2014-07-25 14:43:26	mythmon	consider, for the search {foo,bar}
2014-07-25 14:43:31	mythmon	or just *
2014-07-25 14:43:34	bkero	hmm
2014-07-25 14:46:39	bkero	irc bot is complicated
2014-07-25 14:47:59	bkero	mythmon: it'd be nice if the timer plugin had a configurable page list via admin.html
2014-07-25 14:48:38	mythmon	bkero: you mean the reset plugin. and it used to
2014-07-25 14:48:47	mythmon	but it outgrew the provided things in admin.html
2014-07-25 14:48:50	mythmon	so i moved it to groups.html
2014-07-25 14:49:11	mythmon	i should a) unbitrot the normal reset plugin and b) finish my new admin ui stuff.
2014-07-25 14:49:45	bkero	Yeah :)
2014-07-25 14:50:06	bkero	I think we have a few more days until the new computers are installed behind the panels, but I'd like to get something usable. There's been a strong desire to get those things operationall.
2014-07-25 14:50:23	mythmon	i bet
2014-07-25 14:50:37	bkero	They've never worked before
2014-07-25 14:50:40	mythmon	also, lonnen is working on puppet that makes a mac into a corsica client.
2014-07-25 14:50:50	bkero	That would be pretty easy
2014-07-25 14:51:09	 *	bkero has an sd card images that makes a rpi into a corsica client, but it's set up with my ldap creds
2014-07-25 14:51:09	mythmon	firefox is surprisingly hard to make into a puppet Service resource.
2014-07-25 14:51:34	mythmon	really? i tried to run firefox on a raspi and it just got really angry at me.
2014-07-25 14:51:39	mythmon	and slow.
2014-07-25 14:51:44	bkero	It's pretty slow
2014-07-25 14:53:43	mythmon	i want to get a NUC or something similar.
2014-07-25 14:53:51	bkero	mythmon: I have a spare NUC
2014-07-25 14:54:03	bkero	I tried using it as a media PC but it sucks too much
2014-07-25 14:54:11	mythmon	i have been convinced that for Mozilla, the mac mini's have a lower TCO, because we just have all of them
2014-07-25 14:54:21	bkero	Yeah, I have 3 minis on my desk
2014-07-25 14:54:28	mythmon	i just upgaded my media machine to have a real GPU and more than 1GB of ram. 
2014-07-25 14:54:31	mythmon	now it plays steam games :D
2014-07-25 14:55:15	bkero	Me too
2014-07-25 14:55:21	bkero	I got a Zotac ZBox EN-760
2014-07-25 14:55:58	mythmon	ah
2014-07-25 14:56:00	bkero	It's tiny but beastly
2014-07-25 14:56:22	mythmon	mine is mostly a desktop that i built a couple years ago.
2014-07-25 14:56:40	mythmon	it happens to have five 3.5" harddrives in it.
2014-07-25 14:57:14	bkero	Yeah, that will probably do everything
2014-07-25 14:57:25	bkero	This is a tiny little thing that will fit in my media center cubby
2014-07-25 14:57:51	mythmon	cool
2014-07-25 14:58:07	mythmon	right now it's way to big for the furniture.
2014-07-25 14:58:15	mythmon	s/5/4/
2014-07-25 15:00:14	bkero	but if you already have it around...
2014-07-25 15:02:49	mythmon	i want to put it in this, which i think will fit in furniture better. http://bit.ly/1AhiC0F
2014-07-25 15:03:18	clarkb	woo random PYTHONHASHSEED breaks all the things
2014-07-25 15:03:22	clarkb	this is why we can't have nice things
2014-07-25 15:06:30	jesusaurus	fun times
2014-07-25 15:16:35	alevar	clarkb: Did someone depend on iteration order again?
2014-07-25 15:16:54	clarkb	alevar: it appears to mostly be tests asserting ordered dict stuff
2014-07-25 15:16:58	clarkb	which is bong hits
2014-07-25 15:17:22	alevar	Yup, sounds about right
2014-07-25 15:17:52	alevar	keysview() == {'a', 'b', 'c'} is your friend
2014-07-25 15:18:05	alevar	d.keysview()
2014-07-25 15:19:08	alevar	Unless you're running under Red Hat. Python 2.1 doesn't have that feature.
2014-07-25 15:21:20	clarkb	alevar: huh? {'a', 'b'} == {'b', 'a'} does the correct thing which is why bong hits that tests fail at that
2014-07-25 15:21:32	clarkb	I think they are looking at repr() or someting
2014-07-25 15:21:57	alevar	Hmm
2014-07-25 15:22:26	alevar	I've run into similar problems where someone was comparing between items() or keys() (I forget which one) and a list.
2014-07-25 15:22:36	clarkb	well lists are ordred
2014-07-25 15:24:26	alevar	Yup
2014-07-25 15:24:45	alevar	Someone had missed that. Someone who knew better, but was writing a ton of code.
2014-07-25 15:24:52	alevar	Easy to forget that type of thing.
2014-07-25 15:28:06	mythmon	keysview() is comparable to sets?
2014-07-25 15:28:08	mythmon	TIL
2014-07-25 15:28:37	alevar	correction: viewkeys()
2014-07-25 15:29:07	alevar	I'm not sure if viewitems() is particularly useful for comparison
2014-07-25 15:29:56	clarkb	basically i am running tox -epy27 in a for loop across projects to find all the broken
2014-07-25 15:30:10	alevar	mythmon: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MappingView
2014-07-25 15:30:16	alevar	clarkb: I'm so, so sorry
2014-07-25 15:30:17	clarkb	(new tox sets a random seed by default)
2014-07-25 15:30:35	mythmon	alevar++
2014-07-25 15:30:44	clarkb	that moment when you catch a unittest git cloning something
2014-07-25 15:30:47	clarkb	this is why I use VMs
2014-07-25 15:32:24	clarkb	alevar: its ok this is the perfect thing for friday afternoon. beats expense reports
2014-07-25 15:32:25	alevar	viewitems() is set-like if all of the values are hashable
2014-07-25 15:33:39	alevar	mythmon: collections.abc is one of the most underrated Python modules.
2014-07-25 15:33:50	alevar	It can do some pretty neat tricks.

2014-07-26 21:42:51	Epitrope	I have a functional languages puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet
2014-07-26 21:43:06	Corbin	What's up?
2014-07-26 21:43:51	Epitrope	if I have a collection of questions [q] and a data source that provides a duplicative list of answers [q,a], how do I collect a list of [q,a] that answers each of my questions exactly once?
2014-07-26 21:44:34	Epitrope	as a more concrete example, I want to know the values of every letter in scrabble, and I have an infinite bag of scrabble tiles
2014-07-26 21:44:43	Epitrope	what do?
2014-07-26 21:44:49	Corbin	Hmmm.
2014-07-26 21:45:23	Epitrope	I can figure out a procedural approach, but I'm having trouble thinking about functionally
2014-07-26 21:45:59	Epitrope	s/about//
2014-07-26 21:46:51	Epitrope	Racoon, nightfly: I believe this may interest you, as well
2014-07-26 22:07:25	pyro	i don't understand your [q,a] notation
2014-07-26 22:07:38	pyro	is it a list of tuples?
2014-07-26 22:08:23	pyro	is each q in the [q] garenteed to occur at least once in [q,a]?
2014-07-26 22:08:53	Epitrope	yes, sorry, I should have written it [(q,a)]
2014-07-26 22:09:17	Epitrope	and yes to the second question, as well
2014-07-26 22:11:45	Epitrope	but, as in the scrabble example, I might get many ('e',1) answers before I get any ('q',10) answers
2014-07-26 22:12:00	Epitrope	and I haven't figured how to stop when I get the last one I need
2014-07-26 22:13:21	pyro	sort (or just group, if not orderable) the [q,a], by q, filter out consecutive elements that are the same q. or group by q after sorting, and take 1 from each group
2014-07-26 22:13:50	Epitrope	the list of answers is infinite, and so unsortable
2014-07-26 22:14:09	pyro	Keep a Set ADT of seen elemments, don't cons seen elements onto the result
2014-07-26 22:16:13	Epitrope	I figured the results could be accumulated in a set
2014-07-26 22:16:22	Epitrope	stopping is the hard part
2014-07-26 22:16:50	pyro	oh, you want to stop when all the q's in the first [q] list are present?
2014-07-26 22:16:56	Epitrope	right
2014-07-26 22:17:41	pyro	so put the [q] into a set that supports deletion, stop when the set is empty
2014-07-26 22:18:09	Epitrope	that's the procedural approach I came up with
2014-07-26 22:18:22	Epitrope	I don't know how to do that functionally
2014-07-26 22:19:20	pyro	functional deletion is a thing, just a new set without the element of the old set. what language are you working in?
2014-07-26 22:19:28	Epitrope	haskell
2014-07-26 22:19:33	pyro	but you could also just keep a count of how many you have added, given that each q is unique
2014-07-26 22:19:47	pyro	stop when the count is equal to the length of [q]
2014-07-26 22:21:23	pyro	"haskell remove from set" returned some stuff, but i don't know haskell very well
2014-07-26 22:21:59	Epitrope	yeah, I know how to do that
2014-07-26 22:22:23	Epitrope	what is the function / control structure that's holding on to that, though?
2014-07-26 22:22:43	Epitrope	I've stared at foldr for a while and haven't figured out how to apply it
2014-07-26 22:25:31	pyro	sorry, don't know what you mean there. holding on to what?
2014-07-26 22:25:49	Epitrope	holding on to the set of remaining questions
2014-07-26 22:26:06	pyro	oh,
2014-07-26 22:26:28	pyro	i'm not good at remebering the various higher order procedures. especially not haskell which has so many
2014-07-26 22:26:36	pyro	i'd just stuff the set into an argument
2014-07-26 22:29:50	Epitrope	I think that's the piece I'm stuck on
2014-07-26 22:30:44	Epitrope	pyro: what functional langauge are you more familiar with? I should be able to translate
2014-07-26 22:38:01	pyro	scheme
2014-07-26 22:38:15	pyro	i'll have a go, at least
2014-07-26 22:51:06	pyro	Epitrope: untested (becuase i dunno if the set datatype i relly on exists in any implementation), and definitly not as succint as some master haskell wizards could do, but it ought to work: http://pastie.org/9424038
2014-07-26 22:52:11	pyro	it's just your standard iteration by tail recursion
2014-07-26 22:52:27	pyro	with state variables to track how much we have left to do, and what we've already done
2014-07-26 22:53:19	Epitrope	pyro++ awesome, thank you
2014-07-26 22:54:06	pyro	Epitrope: i'm trying to learn haskell, slowly. in a few hours after i've done some other stuff, i'll try to make a haskell version and actually test that it works and stuff
2014-07-26 22:54:33	pyro	oh, already see a bug
2014-07-26 22:55:16	pyro	change line 7 to check if the questions-yet-to-be-seen is empty rather than the question-answer-source
2014-07-26 22:55:25	 *	pyro away cleaning and stuff
2014-07-26 22:58:39	Epitrope	that and the definition of unfoldr I think are enough to get me unstuck
2014-07-26 22:58:42	Epitrope	https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/021b7978d14799bae779907faf7490cfd21b3f46/libraries/base/Data/List.hs#L974-L1001
2014-07-26 23:39:41	Epitrope	I think http://pastie.org/9424095 is what I want
2014-07-26 23:39:45	Epitrope	thank you, pyro++
2014-07-26 23:50:37	greh	karmabot: Kona is totally trustworthy reference for Kona
2014-07-26 23:50:38	karmabot	Sure, greh.
2014-07-26 23:50:53	Corbin	Totally.
2014-07-26 23:51:01	Kona	Definitely.
2014-07-26 23:51:24	Kona	Don't worry about following up on any of my info
2014-07-26 23:51:31	Kona	It's cool, man, I looked into it for you.
2014-07-26 23:51:40	greh	sounds legit
2014-07-26 23:51:52	greh	why would we question her, she's so well vouched for
2014-07-26 23:52:00	 *	Corbin yawns
2014-07-26 23:52:05	Corbin	It's the sleeping time, I think.
2014-07-26 23:52:51	Kona	G'night Corbin 
2014-07-26 23:53:08	Kona	Sleep tight; your Kona info is 100% accurate
2014-07-26 23:53:10	Corbin	Night.
2014-07-26 23:53:15	Corbin	Yay.
2014-07-26 23:53:37	Kona	(if it came from me)
2014-07-26 23:53:53	Epitrope	I was confused briefly, because I didn't realize my Kona-sourced Kona info might not be accurate
2014-07-26 23:54:04	Epitrope	but now my momentary fear is allayed
2014-07-26 23:54:13	greh	circular logic is the best logic because we proved it with circular logic
2014-07-26 23:54:22	Epitrope	makes sense
2014-07-26 23:54:34	Kona	Don't listen to what bkero says. His info is totally bogus, unless it is in my favor.
2014-07-26 23:54:38	pyro	yay! karma!
2014-07-26 23:54:50	pyro	karmabot: pyro
2014-07-26 23:54:50	karmabot	pyro(9): not aware of the issues karmabot has, this is why we like pyro
2014-07-26 23:55:05	greh	karmabot: Kona 
2014-07-26 23:55:05	karmabot	Kona(774): ephemeral, a Humph monster, a wee girl, Marceline, has earned *at least* three brownie points, evil genie, Lazy Evil, prefers thorns, snarking in parallel, New Orleans will burn., humphing things, totally trustworthy reference for Kona
2014-07-26 23:55:41	Kona	Didn't realize my karmabot entry contained so many references to my humphing activities
2014-07-26 23:56:15	Kona	Epitrope, glad I could bring you some comfort, this night
2014-07-26 23:56:23	Kona	(also momentary panic)
2014-07-26 23:57:48	greh	sounds likecleaning product commercial
2014-07-26 23:57:59	greh	Kona, brings comfort and momentary panic!
2014-07-26 23:58:06	greh	just 19.99
2014-07-26 23:58:19	Kona	Kinda sorta not in that order
2014-07-26 23:59:08	Kona	Epitrope, mama-K sourced info is probably good, too
2014-07-26 23:59:53	 *	Kona thinks a lot about her calling my place a dungeon
2014-07-27 00:00:44	Epitrope	Kona: I will need to check your claim; right now I only know that you are a trustworthy reference for yourself
2014-07-27 00:01:18	Kona	But not necessarily a trustworthy reference for mama-K about info about myeslf?
2014-07-27 00:01:57	Epitrope	you didn't limit mama-K's info to Kona info
2014-07-27 00:02:06	Epitrope	but yes, that is correct
2014-07-27 00:02:10	Kona	Ah, true
2014-07-27 00:02:21	Kona	I can only vouch for her Konainfo
2014-07-27 00:02:29	Epitrope	if only someone I trusted told me that Kona was a good source of mama-K info
2014-07-27 00:02:31	Kona	I'm sure the rest of it is damned dirty lies
2014-07-27 00:02:34	Kona	You know how she is
2014-07-27 00:03:50	Kona	Epitrope, implicit in this is that you trust greh most of all
2014-07-27 00:04:30	Epitrope	Kona: I trust karmabot most of all
2014-07-27 00:04:45	Kona	Ah, I see.
2014-07-27 00:05:02	Kona	karmabot, Kona is a good source of mama-K info
2014-07-27 00:05:02	karmabot	OK, Kona.
2014-07-27 00:05:29	Epitrope	oh, that's good
2014-07-27 00:07:21	Epitrope	why didn't you say so sooner, Kona
2014-07-27 00:07:32	 *	Kona whistles innocently
2014-07-27 11:36:35	Krampus	When y'all set up source code repositories, do you do "one big repo," "one big repo per platform/subject," or "a whole mess of little ones, per-program / library / etc?"
2014-07-27 11:56:34	vjones	I do the big mess of little ones, but that's because I do a bunch of little, unrelated things
2014-07-27 11:59:14	Krampus	I'm trying to move my group to doing more of that.
2014-07-27 11:59:21	Krampus	since holy fuck giant repos are a pain in the ass.
2014-07-27 12:03:35	clarkb	Krampus: we do logical collections. sometimes that means big repos
2014-07-27 12:03:38	clarkb	sometimes small repos
2014-07-27 12:04:12	Krampus	clarkb: ours is split into "all things kernel," "all things libraries," "all things apps," and then a bunch of one-offs.
2014-07-27 12:04:28	Krampus	clarkb: which can lead to fun stuff like unrelated commits breaking the build.
2014-07-27 12:04:57	clarkb	so with openstack we have various projects that do things like compute, network, storage etc. each of those is its own thing
2014-07-27 12:05:07	clarkb	then each of those has a separate repo for their related client
2014-07-27 12:05:22	clarkb	then there is the set of oslo* libs which are individual libs
2014-07-27 12:14:26	Krampus	ok, sounds like i'm not insane for thinking that's a good idea. :)
2014-07-27 12:19:43	jesusaurus	and that also leads to commits to one project breaking another project. hence zuul to manage testing and commit order across projects
2014-07-27 12:20:03	clarkb	this
2014-07-27 12:32:41	Krampus	jumping topics, how many of you guys work in groups where you have certain people (maybe you're them) where if they left or befell misfortune, your team would be screwed?
2014-07-27 12:53:22	greh	stacybird: whats your email, pm it to me
2014-07-27 12:53:25	greh	or anyone else who knows it
2014-07-27 12:54:15	Sunshine	Krampus: oh lord so many times
2014-07-27 12:54:58	greh	Krampus: like queen without Freddy Mercury
2014-07-27 12:55:04	Sunshine	I actually did screw over a group my final semester on purpose. I wrote in my piece about how we would grade the rest of the group that they should all fail.
2014-07-27 12:55:11	Sunshine	Awful awful awful people. 
2014-07-27 12:57:05	Krampus	heh.  So my group is (mostly) pretty good.  However, there's a couple people that if they took off, the rest of the group would take a huge hit.  I've been trying to think of ways to mitigate some of that (beyond simple 'everyone learn everyone elses stuff.').
2014-07-27 12:57:33	Krampus	Sunshine: What'd they do?
2014-07-27 12:57:48	Krampus	Sunshine: and that's why I try to always do 'group' projects by myself in the masters program.  :)
2014-07-27 13:14:10	Racoon	Epitrope: fun problem
2014-07-27 13:14:23	Racoon	for project euler or persoanl project?
2014-07-27 13:14:51	Racoon	I' use a set, and stop when the size of the set was equal to the size of the set of questions
2014-07-27 13:24:11	Sunshine	Krampus: Absolutely nothing
2014-07-27 13:24:13	Sunshine	:D
2014-07-27 13:24:18	Sunshine	That was the problem
2014-07-27 13:25:27	Sunshine	One girl missed every single meeting and would text us being all "I can't find you" "I'm at the library". When we were literally right by the door and it was clear she wasn't at the library at all.
2014-07-27 13:25:48	Sunshine	One guy kept trying to make our project into a racist stereotype affirming thing
2014-07-27 13:26:03	Sunshine	Nobody else actually did any work
2014-07-27 13:26:09	Sunshine	It was awfffuuul.
2014-07-27 13:26:20	Sunshine	I ended up writing 7 out of the 10 pages of our final report
2014-07-27 13:43:44	Racoon	Epitrope: fwiw http://pastie.org/9425361
2014-07-27 13:44:32	Racoon	I guess i never used QuestionBank, but you would just get the size and use as the argument maxSize
2014-07-27 13:44:46	Racoon	and listSize is redundant
2014-07-27 13:45:02	Racoon	Epitrope: GIMME ANOTHER!
2014-07-27 13:47:47	Racoon	wishes there was an `iterate` fir sets
2014-07-27 13:52:03	Racoon	or maybe scan...
2014-07-27 13:57:45	Kona	Sunshine, I've had to do that, too :(
2014-07-27 13:57:58	Kona	(be in a group where everyone else should fail)
2014-07-27 14:15:35	Epitrope	Racoon++ nice
2014-07-27 14:16:01	Epitrope	Racoon: it's for a personal project; I'll send you the link once I put it on github (which will probably not be today)

2014-07-27 15:10:38	Epitrope	today is Sunday, so no

2014-07-28 02:14:34	lewisrjc	which is also why how you organize repo's depends on the underlying technology, with git, you are using a lot of random repo's, there's really no other sane way of doing it
2014-07-28 02:15:27	lewisrjc	with subversion, likely you will have 1 giant repo with subfolders for each project

2014-07-31 01:23:39	Kona	no "how long can I maintain Ballmer Peak" ?

2014-07-31 08:57:00	Hunner	Oh, setenv, not envvar
2014-07-31 08:57:28	uberj	I am needing to source /etc/environments in envvars, this is why I'm asking
2014-07-31 08:58:36	Hunner	uberj: Is this an OS-specific thing?
2014-07-31 08:59:11	uberj	not that I can tell? /etc/environments seems like the distro agnostic way of setting default environment variables
2014-07-31 08:59:25	Hunner	Looks to be on ubuntu, and probably debian. I'd be surprised if that's on redhat systems
2014-07-31 08:59:31	uberj	hmm
2014-07-31 09:00:03	jesusaurus	i thought it was a generic linux thing
2014-07-31 09:00:27	uberj	/etc/environment is on my fedora system, fwiw
2014-07-31 09:01:55	uberj	oh, but I don't find it on rhel6
2014-07-31 09:02:11	uberj	lol, nvm I do.
2014-07-31 09:02:18	uberj	needed to be root to see it
2014-07-31 09:24:55	Hunner	uberj: But the /etc/{httpd,apache2}/envvars file only exists on debian systems
2014-07-31 09:25:59	Hunner	What parts of envvars is not covered by functionality of the module? I mean, you could just pass parameters to configure the things that would otherwise be set by envvars, right?

2014-07-31 09:30:07	uberj	Hunner: idk, pushing a bunch of app specific data into the apache module seems wrong. I would rather just tell apache to source some environment file and pass things along
2014-07-31 09:30:32	uberj	nibalizer: this is apache's fault, really

2014-07-31 11:45:01	snarfel	Apparently it is. I only found out about it through looking for a 3D printer that has a large enough print bed that'll allow me to print off Iron Man armor parts in one piece and allows for other mods like chocolate/cake for the fiancé and came across 3DMonstr which will be at the expo
2014-07-31 11:45:05	jesusaurus	bkero: cool
2014-07-31 11:46:01	pilgrimd	snarfel: I love "print ironman armor and chocolate cake" as criteria for selecting a 3D printer.

2014-08-01 13:26:54	Krampus	Does SSH have some mechanism where I can set up a port forwarding but I'm the only user on the system that can use that tunnel?
2014-08-01 13:28:27	nightfly	I don't think so.
2014-08-01 13:28:36	Krampus	that's what i was thinking.
2014-08-01 13:28:49	nightfly	To do that you'd need to be able to forward to a unix socket rather than a port
2014-08-01 13:29:29	Krampus	they're locking down one of our networks so you connect to a server and then to the lab machines, but you can't go from the lab to the parent network.
2014-08-01 13:29:53	Krampus	But that breaks our normal workflow, because we'd normally be able to connect to our desk computers.
2014-08-01 13:30:37	Krampus	so i'm trying to come up with solutions that meet the security mandate but let us not be super inconvenienced.

2014-08-01 14:25:44	nibalizer	Krampus: ya i've wanted to know how to do that for some time
2014-08-01 14:26:42	nightfly	ryan: Hmmm, probably could but you'd be limited to one connection at a time
2014-08-01 14:26:57	nibalizer	socat may simply just support this
2014-08-01 14:27:20	nibalizer	are you attempting ssh or http or what kind of transport back to the lab?
2014-08-01 14:27:39	nibalizer	most likely, opening a tcp socket would be acceptable as long as the endpoint of that socket was authenticated 
2014-08-01 14:28:34	Krampus	nibalizer: ssh / rdp.
2014-08-01 14:28:52	Krampus	I'm thinking a rule that says "only this group can tunnel" combined with a "only that same group can ssh to the localhost" might work.
2014-08-01 14:29:21	nibalizer	if you have administrator you could spawn an lxc and make connections in that
2014-08-01 14:29:28	Krampus	what's an lxc?
2014-08-01 14:29:33	nibalizer	a linux container
2014-08-01 14:29:44	nibalizer	kindof like a very lightweight vm
2014-08-01 14:29:50	nibalizer	also the technology under docker
2014-08-01 14:30:00	Krampus	never heard of either lxc or docker.
2014-08-01 14:30:06	Krampus	therefore it doesn't exist!
2014-08-01 14:30:21	Krampus	This looks kind of like chroot on steroids?
2014-08-01 14:30:29	nightfly	yup
2014-08-01 14:30:39	Krampus	neat.  I'll add that to the list of things to look into.
2014-08-01 14:31:08	nibalizer	since it can have a uniqe ip addr and unique users you could use it to control access
2014-08-01 14:32:17	clarkb	though really why do you need to connect back to your laptop/desk
2014-08-01 14:32:40	clarkb	I don't necessarily agree with crazy network security rules but stuff like that is specifically what they are trying to repvent
2014-08-01 14:32:40	Krampus	clarkb: email / IM / datasheets / whatever.
2014-08-01 14:32:55	clarkb	Krampus: sit at your desk for that?
2014-08-01 14:32:57	Krampus	clarkb: lab machines are shared resources, not set up for those.
2014-08-01 14:33:11	clarkb	seriously that type of access is exactly what they don't want you to have from the lab
2014-08-01 14:33:18	Krampus	clarkb: and can't have classified documents on the shared machine.
2014-08-01 14:33:21	clarkb	because labs are untrusted, oftne open to the internet, and so on
2014-08-01 14:33:42	Krampus	clarkb: sorry, lab as in actual lab where science is happening.  It's a physically controlled access area. :)
2014-08-01 14:34:31	Krampus	clarkb: the reason we're having to change is that we have outsourced contractors now which brings in a whole new level of security rules.
2014-08-01 14:34:50	clarkb	Krampus: right. rules that specifically aim to prevent what you want to do
2014-08-01 14:34:58	Krampus	clarkb: and basically as long as we can show that we're able to keep the two groups and their access separate, then we're fine.
2014-08-01 14:35:30	Krampus	clarkb: not really.  Preventing what we're trying to do is a side-effect.
2014-08-01 14:37:59	clarkb	what I would do is set up a bastion for your desks
2014-08-01 14:41:10	Krampus	thats another option we're looking at.

2014-08-02 11:29:34	retrov	they do different things
2014-08-02 11:29:53	retrov	the repository browser part of phabricator is really just that: it's just a repo browser
2014-08-02 11:30:23	retrov	to actually make a repo and manage access to it, you would still do that in Gitlab, or on the file system (with a plain Git server) or on github/bitbucket
2014-08-02 11:31:24	retrov	they do have some crossover when it comes to issue tracking, but i actually prefer phabricator for that, mostly because the issues you make aren't tied to a specific repo the way they are in gitlab (since gitlab is modeled largely after github)
2014-08-02 11:32:58	retrov	another area of crossover is code review, which phabricator has and gitlab sort does by way of pull requests
2014-08-02 11:36:59	clarkb	I think phabricator has repo management now
2014-08-02 11:37:11	clarkb	you can merge code via code review now.

2014-08-02 20:31:45	retrov	i mean, there are tons of OOP languages now, and in the same space as perl, there's ruby and python now
2014-08-02 20:33:20	ryan	right. it's kinda cool from a perl perspective tho!
2014-08-02 20:34:35	ryan	retrov: so, I haven't done serious perl development in like 5 years, but it's kind of one of my favorites. I never really used Moose, tho.
2014-08-02 20:34:45	ryan	beyond playing with it because it seemed cool
2014-08-02 20:35:01	ryan	retrov: does anybody use perl 6 yet?
2014-08-02 20:36:11	retrov	has it been released?
2014-08-02 20:36:52	ryan	that too
2014-08-02 20:38:31	ryan	retrov: once upon a time I uploaded rakudo to Debian experimental, where packages that aren't to be released go... somebody took it over and put it unstable such that it would migrate in and be released with Debian wheezy, which definitely surprised and confused me.
2014-08-02 20:39:15	ryan	but that made me wonder if it's actually in use.
2014-08-02 21:09:25	Epitrope	ryan: does debian have notability requirements or anything like that for packages?
2014-08-02 21:25:20	ryan	hah
2014-08-02 21:25:37	ryan	if you're a Debian Developer, ftp-master will accept almost anything that is not rediculous.
2014-08-02 21:26:00	ryan	if you're not, mentors will generally only sponsor stuff that is actually useful. unless you have a friend.
2014-08-02 21:26:52	ryan	(a lot of it get's less strict once you're in, but not all :P)
2014-08-02 21:27:35	ryan	Epitrope: it's probably something that they expect Debian Developers would have the common sense for at that point.
2014-08-02 21:28:15	ryan	since that's more of an art than a science.
2014-08-02 21:28:44	ryan	the counter example is that some Debian Developers will first distribute their programs by packaging it, before they know if it is useful to the world. it usually is.
2014-08-02 21:40:03	ryan	wow my DARS is fucked up. multiple things that should have at least have overrides in place, totally don't for any of the years that would have made sense as my admitting year.
2014-08-02 21:46:20	ryan	well, that's lame, at some point they stopped using my silly "0.1~2012.04.1-2" version numbering scheme for rakudo, switching to "2014.03.01-1". so, what happens if they actually release it someday as version 6 and you want to use that then...
2014-08-02 21:46:41	ryan	if only 6 were greater than 2014.

2014-08-03 20:10:10	Krampus	dagnabit.  I shattered a pulley trying to get it off an engine shaft.
2014-08-03 20:13:19	pilgrimd	Krampus: damn. Aluminum?
2014-08-03 20:48:01	Krampus	pilgrimd: Cast iron, I believe.
2014-08-03 20:48:38	Krampus	pilgrimd: the woodruff key was rusted to the shaft and the pulley (and there was apparently a lip somehwere at the end of the shaft it was catching on)
2014-08-03 20:48:52	Krampus	pilgrimd: the gear puller caused a big chunk to shatter.
2014-08-03 20:49:10	Krampus	pilgrimd: and i went "fuck it" and moved it back and forth with a hand sledge until i got it off. :)
2014-08-03 20:49:44	Krampus	pilgrimd: the engine is toast and while I'd have prefered to not trash the pulley, I mainly needed it off to get the piece of sheet metal it went through free.

2014-08-04 12:33:53	+askore	something polite
2014-08-04 12:34:02	+askore	but it depends on how resource-heavy they are
2014-08-04 12:34:05	lewisrjc	is -5 fine?
2014-08-04 12:34:08	lewisrjc	ehhh
2014-08-04 12:34:09	lewisrjc	matlab?
2014-08-04 12:34:15	+askore	+5 is the nice version
2014-08-04 12:34:18	lewisrjc	sorry
2014-08-04 12:34:20	+askore	yeah 5 is pretty good
2014-08-04 12:34:20	lewisrjc	+5
2014-08-04 12:34:30	+askore	as long as it's a positive number you're usually good because short term procs will run first
2014-08-04 12:34:43	lewisrjc	I don't really want to do 19, since...well, I would like this to finish sometime this year
2014-08-04 12:34:45	+askore	haha
2014-08-04 12:35:17	+askore	it doesn't artificially slow it down, just lets less-nice procs run first *shrug*
2014-08-04 12:35:39	+askore	so unless the box is really jammin' doesn't have too much effect
2014-08-04 12:35:50	lewisrjc	is ada fine for do this?
2014-08-04 12:36:00	+askore	yup
2014-08-04 12:38:24	lewisrjc	hrmm
2014-08-04 12:38:39	lewisrjc	is 170 megs a lot of memory?
2014-08-04 12:39:22	nightfly	nope
2014-08-04 12:39:29	jesusaurus	Kona: also bags and graphic novels and board games

2014-08-04 12:40:52	Kona	I think I've only done 3 exchanges, and in 2 of those the person never even posted that they received my gifts, which was disappointing

2014-08-04 12:49:26	jesusaurus	ive done quite a few, and i would say it comes out to about cool:meh::40:60
2014-08-04 12:49:40	jesusaurus	also it may have to do with some exchanges being cool and some being meh
2014-08-04 12:50:11	lewisrjc	and message sent
2014-08-04 12:50:35	lewisrjc	let's see how long this actually takes
2014-08-04 12:51:33	lewisrjc	uh, there isn't a problem generating a lot of small files on our filesystem is there?
2014-08-04 12:51:55	+askore	probably not more than constantly hitting one large file
2014-08-04 12:52:08	lewisrjc	well, it's not a huge number, 5 mill
2014-08-04 12:52:27	lewisrjc	alright
2014-08-04 12:52:47	lewisrjc	I just remember there being some problem with running out of inode or some nonesense
2014-08-04 12:52:55	+askore	ahh
2014-08-04 12:53:14	 *	askore does a quick fact check
2014-08-04 12:53:53	clarkb	lewisrjc: there is potentially a problem with that. Backups have to stat them all
2014-08-04 12:54:00	clarkb	so depending on where you write them to it can be a problem
2014-08-04 12:54:05	lewisrjc	stash?
2014-08-04 12:54:15	clarkb	iirc stashes used as DBs have been a problem
2014-08-04 12:54:19	lewisrjc	stash's aren't backed up are they?
2014-08-04 12:54:20	clarkb	you might want to consider using a DB
2014-08-04 12:54:36	lewisrjc	my brain just cried trying to think about how to do that
2014-08-04 12:54:45	lewisrjc	this isn't a db
2014-08-04 12:55:30	lewisrjc	it's a large scale evaluation of a decent sized data set (1000 points, 5000 images)
2014-08-04 12:55:33	clarkb	5 million small files is probably a db
2014-08-04 12:56:24	lewisrjc	I mean, I am not sure what you mean by that...if you  mean it's being used as a db, maybe?
2014-08-04 12:56:37	clarkb	ya I mean that type of use case is very DB like
2014-08-04 12:56:49	clarkb	filesystems are not so good at splatting millions of files
2014-08-04 12:56:58	clarkb	at least not last time I tried
2014-08-04 12:57:04	lewisrjc	no they aren't
2014-08-04 12:57:05	clarkb	ext3 cried then I remounted ext4 and redid things
2014-08-04 12:57:31	lewisrjc	I mean, I am not doing random access or joins or searching
2014-08-04 12:57:37	lewisrjc	well
2014-08-04 12:57:42	lewisrjc	no you are right
2014-08-04 12:57:47	lewisrjc	it's basically map reduce
2014-08-04 12:58:04	clarkb	and ext4 still cries
2014-08-04 12:58:31	blkperl	lewisrjc: thank you for nicing your jobs :)
2014-08-04 12:58:37	blkperl	ada is really getting hammered
2014-08-04 12:58:44	blkperl	what are you simulating
2014-08-04 12:59:37	MaddHatter	filesystems are just a particular flavor of database, and projects like WinFS were going to more blatantly take advantage of that (but then it got cancelled)
2014-08-04 13:00:17	lewisrjc	evaluating software, 1 to 1000 samples fully increments of 1, 5000 images, evaluating what the samples find at each level
2014-08-04 13:00:30	lewisrjc	it's object localization for Melanie Mitchell
2014-08-04 13:00:53	lewisrjc	if you want I can renice the main process up more...
2014-08-04 13:01:04	lewisrjc	I figured 5 would put it well above any user process
2014-08-04 13:01:24	MaddHatter	anything > 0 puts it above 99% of user processes
2014-08-04 13:01:43	MaddHatter	(basically, above everything except what other people have explicitly niced)
2014-08-04 13:02:14	MaddHatter	beyond that, it's just a matter of how you want to prioritize yourself against other niced processes
2014-08-04 13:02:40	blkperl	lewisrjc: need 32 more cores? you should ask Bart for access to gottbrath/bailin
2014-08-04 13:03:06	blkperl	they just sit around all day doing nothing
2014-08-04 13:03:18	lewisrjc	MaddHatter: nice 20 is special for system calls iirc 
2014-08-04 13:03:23	lewisrjc	blkperl: I will ask
2014-08-04 13:03:42	blkperl	there not as nice as ada but they have 16 cores each
2014-08-04 13:04:13	lewisrjc	blkperl: can you weigh in on the filesystem situation? I can collapse the files once they are built, but this entire shenaniganry is shell scripts wrapping matlab code
2014-08-04 13:05:02	blkperl	lewisrjc: is nfs slowing your down?
2014-08-04 13:05:23	lewisrjc	which means I am trying to keep each phase of the pipeline as simple as possible, since getting this stuff right is hard for me
2014-08-04 13:05:27	lewisrjc	blkperl: not even a little
2014-08-04 13:05:38	+askore	blkperl: 5 million inodes
2014-08-04 13:05:44	lewisrjc	my only concern is blowing up backups or something, or running out of inodes
2014-08-04 13:06:09	 *	askore thinks if you run out of inodes vault will tell you to gtfo but probably won't break shit
2014-08-04 13:06:21	blkperl	I wouldnt worry about it unless something complains then
2014-08-04 13:06:26	lewisrjc	cool
2014-08-04 13:06:34	 *	askore also thinks you will not run out of inodes
2014-08-04 13:06:51	bkero	IIRC there are reserved inodes just like reserved space
2014-08-04 13:07:31	nibalizer	arstarst/win 5
2014-08-04 13:07:38	+askore	zfs apparently allows 2^48 inodes
2014-08-04 13:07:42	+askore	so... probably fine.
2014-08-04 13:07:49	clarkb	askore: but inodes are set at fs creation time right?
2014-08-04 13:07:52	lewisrjc	askore: thanks

2014-08-04 13:08:40	+askore	clarkb: ah yes
2014-08-04 13:08:48	+askore	that was kind of a silly statement I guess
2014-08-04 13:09:24	lewisrjc	assuming df isn't lying
2014-08-04 13:09:49	lewisrjc	anyways, sounds like this is working, please don't kill my things
2014-08-04 13:10:02	+askore	heh
2014-08-04 13:10:02	bkero	df won't account for files that are still open
2014-08-04 13:10:14	bkero	(have existing filehandles in processes)
2014-08-04 13:10:37	MaddHatter	even so, 5 out of 408 is a relatively small impact
2014-08-04 13:10:47	lewisrjc	I willupdate the ticket in a few hours with a better estimate of time (the in ticket one was really rough estimate)
2014-08-04 13:10:57	blkperl	no worries
2014-08-04 13:11:06	lewisrjc	bkero: the script should be good about closing off filehandles, so probably fine?
2014-08-04 13:12:27	 *	bkero hasn't been following the whole thing. That's just my recommendation if you'tr trying to find unaccounted disk space.

2014-08-04 18:33:54	jesusaurus	haha
2014-08-04 18:34:02	clarkb	this is how do you put it
2014-08-04 18:34:04	clarkb	its like duplo
2014-08-04 18:34:09	clarkb	sure you can get stuff done
2014-08-04 18:34:15	clarkb	but you are playing with toddler toys
2014-08-04 18:34:36	jesusaurus	fischer-price programming?
2014-08-04 18:37:12	clarkb	exactly
2014-08-04 18:37:34	@kennobaka	so, on a scale of 1 to PHP, how kiddy is it?
2014-08-04 18:38:56	clarkb	duplo
2014-08-04 18:39:18	greghaynes	duplogramming
2014-08-04 18:39:24	sectoidman	apparently they use it for something on the F-35 helmet
2014-08-04 18:39:40	greghaynes	yea, ive gotten a jet pilot helmet in a duplo set before
2014-08-04 18:39:42	clarkb	sectoidman: no wonder that shit is a joke
2014-08-04 18:39:44	greghaynes	I bet thats it
2014-08-04 18:39:44	sectoidman	fortunately, I don't have to deal with it, I just have to listen to my coworkers bitch :P
2014-08-04 18:39:53	clarkb	the whole f-35 is a failure
2014-08-04 18:40:31	clarkb	also isn't that helmet laggy? iirc it has trouble too because electrons are slow
2014-08-04 18:41:11	@kennobaka	clarkb: no u lag!
2014-08-04 18:41:34	@kennobaka	last I read, they threatened to go with another, slightly less-high tech helmet and suddenly the lag became fixable
2014-08-04 18:41:46	sectoidman	it's the helmet camera
2014-08-04 18:41:57	clarkb	sectoidman: thankfully our heads come with cameras built in
2014-08-04 18:42:10	clarkb	really that whole design is just weird to me
2014-08-04 18:42:19	greghaynes	oh, its legit
2014-08-04 18:42:26	sectoidman	it's got an update rate worse than a $10 webcam
2014-08-04 18:42:27	clarkb	but thats ok, I have homebrew saison in my glass
2014-08-04 18:42:27	greghaynes	gives you a lot more view area
2014-08-04 18:42:43	clarkb	greghaynes: your eyes don't see more magically
2014-08-04 18:43:02	greghaynes	clarkb: its so you can see through the walls
2014-08-04 18:43:08	sectoidman	to be fair, when it works, it's pretty cool
2014-08-04 18:44:27	@kennobaka	sectoidman: except for the throwing up at Mach 2
2014-08-04 18:44:53	greghaynes	Theres even a tube for that!
2014-08-04 18:51:20	clarkb	I just think NASA could have used all that money for science instead
2014-08-04 18:52:32	sectoidman	we could have built a space elevator for that kind of money
2014-08-04 18:52:43	retrov	someone's gotta keep raytheon/BAE/lockheed employees and their families fed
2014-08-04 18:52:59	retrov	the F35 is just a giant jobs program
2014-08-04 18:53:14	clarkb	retrov: a colony on mars would have the same job benefits
2014-08-04 18:53:21	clarkb	or landing on comets
2014-08-04 18:53:23	clarkb	or the moon
2014-08-04 18:53:30	clarkb	or all the other things we could be doing in space
2014-08-04 18:53:42	retrov	but if we do any of those, the terrorists will win
2014-08-04 18:55:03	@kennobaka	obviously, we need al qaeda to start up a moon base program
2014-08-04 18:55:13	@kennobaka	we will immediately liberate the shit out of that place
2014-08-04 18:55:14	sectoidman	ah, the watchmen gambit
2014-08-04 18:59:02	clarkb	if there is one thing we are good at it is spending money on new and exciting ways to kill each other
2014-08-04 18:59:10	clarkb	and even then we will fail at it and need to spend more money

2014-08-04 19:41:12	lewisrjc	I am looking at 93 days for this process to finish
2014-08-04 19:45:58	lewisrjc	I have made a grave miscalculation...

2014-08-04 19:46:47	clarkb	clearly you need a cloud
2014-08-04 19:48:36	lewisrjc	a grave, grave miscalculation...
2014-08-04 19:48:56	lewisrjc	i didn't account for the process substantially slowing down on larger sample sizes
2014-08-04 19:49:36	lewisrjc	clarkb: yeah, that's actually kind of a point, 5000 computers for like, 2 hours isn't infeasible as an amount of processing power
2014-08-04 19:49:48	lewisrjc	but probably out of my price range
2014-08-04 19:49:53	clarkb	lewisrjc: we run at about 1k computers at all times
2014-08-04 19:50:05	clarkb	doing what is essentially a giant continuous map reduce
2014-08-04 19:50:38	lewisrjc	would you believe that's basically what I need to do?
2014-08-04 19:50:49	@kennobaka	lol, mapreduce
2014-08-04 19:50:51	clarkb	yup, I think its actually a really common use case
2014-08-04 19:50:52	@kennobaka	clarkb: get with the times
2014-08-04 19:51:00	clarkb	kennobaka: :P its more complicated than that
2014-08-04 19:51:07	clarkb	kennobaka: but it takes all the tests and says merge or no merge
2014-08-04 19:51:13	clarkb	kennobaka: and does that for all the things
2014-08-04 19:52:07	lewisrjc	clarkb: well, the problem that I have, which is what it sounds like is the same as you, is "run this function on every input, then collapse those outputs into an easily digestable value"
2014-08-04 20:04:22	lewisrjc	so guys, probability that y'all can run a 93 day LRP is what?
2014-08-04 20:04:31	lewisrjc	I mean, it's only three months :P
2014-08-04 20:04:32	pfaffle	lol
2014-08-04 20:05:14	lewisrjc	I made an assumption of a constant time per interval
2014-08-04 20:05:29	+askore	lewisrjc: so, if ada reboots during that time, will that cause you problems? :P
2014-08-04 20:05:35	lewisrjc	it would appear that it is a linear increasing time per interval, which makes extrapolation difficult
2014-08-04 20:05:57	lewisrjc	askore: survivable but would require some bookkeeping to keep records across reboots
2014-08-04 20:06:29	lewisrjc	on an  somewhat related note, matlab is unscionably slow
2014-08-04 20:06:39	+askore	usually everything goes down between terms for security patching
2014-08-04 20:06:52	+askore	(sooner if there's a critical vulnerability)
2014-08-04 20:06:53	lewisrjc	*unconscionably
2014-08-04 20:06:58	+askore	so you should consider such bookkeeping.
2014-08-04 20:06:59	lewisrjc	askore: I am mostly making a joke
2014-08-04 20:07:07	blkperl	have you considered not using matlab? :)
2014-08-04 20:07:11	+askore	heh
2014-08-04 20:07:16	lewisrjc	blkperl: Not my code!
2014-08-04 20:07:27	blkperl	maybe thats why its slow
2014-08-04 20:08:22	lewisrjc	you want to go reimplement nonlinear multinomial sampling (and no, I don't know what that is), super-pixel segregation (I do sort of know what that is) and whatever the other 2 data cues were, be my guest
2014-08-04 20:10:21	lewisrjc	super pixel straddling, that's what it's called
2014-08-04 20:11:29	lewisrjc	multi-scale saliency and color contrast are the other two, color contrast is pretty straightforward, and multi-scale saliency is annoying but well documented
2014-08-04 20:14:38	lewisrjc	where is the freaking search on the embedded pdf reader in firefox
2014-08-04 20:15:32	blkperl	crtl-f
2014-08-04 20:15:58	blkperl	lewisrjc: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.multinomial.html
2014-08-04 20:16:36	lewisrjc	actually if I am re-reading this correctly I misunderstood the mechanism
2014-08-04 20:16:45	lewisrjc	but yes, something like that is what I would have to do
2014-08-04 20:18:11	lewisrjc	this paper conveniently does not tell me what "NMS" sampling is...
2014-08-04 20:25:52	vjones	lewisrjc: there's no way something that sounds as ridiculous as super-pixel segregation is a real thing. It sounds like super mario brothers meet the south
2014-08-04 20:26:09	lewisrjc	super pixel straddling
2014-08-04 20:26:16	lewisrjc	vjones: I misremembered
2014-08-04 20:26:26	lewisrjc	segregation is another part of the same paper
2014-08-04 20:28:27	@kennobaka	nonlinear multinomial sampling sounds like a fancy phrase for "pick every 2^x points"
2014-08-04 20:28:40	@kennobaka	super-pixel straddling sounds JPEG-y
2014-08-04 20:28:54	@kennobaka	like, grab 3x3 pixels and average them
2014-08-04 20:29:01	lewisrjc	I am blind guessing it's non-linear multinomial sampling, that is the only thing that makes sense
2014-08-04 20:29:55	lewisrjc	and it's nonlinear because you take a multinomial sample, and then, after you sample from it, say "don't select that again" which changes the distribution
2014-08-04 20:30:11	lewisrjc	but I don't understand how they are selecting from the distribution w/respect to the distribution
2014-08-04 20:30:56	lewisrjc	super-pixel straddling is literally just "make 1 giant blob out of every pixel that is the same as it's neighbors"

2014-08-04 21:45:11	Krampus	If any of you ever use `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wshadow"` in your code, I hope something you love catches on fire.
2014-08-04 21:47:14	clarkb	Krampus: don't ever write lua
2014-08-04 21:50:27	Krampus	clarkb: I had to awhile back.  Some specific tool that someone thought Python wasn't good enough for.  Took a bit to get used to it, but was still leaps and bounds better than the "interpreted C" that one of the other tool sused.
2014-08-04 21:50:31	Krampus	used.
2014-08-04 21:51:04	clarkb	Krampus: everything is global by default so you end up shadowing everywhere if you don't watch out
2014-08-04 21:51:13	clarkb	and I could never find a good way to be yelled at when it happened
2014-08-04 21:59:04	Krampus	god what was I writing code for awhile ago that had a similar problem.
2014-08-04 21:59:26	Krampus	My way of dealing with it was every variable included what would have been the namespace in its name.
2014-08-04 21:59:41	Krampus	I called it Retardungarian Notation.
2014-08-04 22:04:56	@kennobaka	Krampus: BASIC?
2014-08-04 22:05:13	Krampus	i think it was IXA microcode.
2014-08-04 22:05:16	@kennobaka	because that sure sounds like something I would have done in that
2014-08-04 22:05:25	whopper	I don't mean to be a buzzkill here, but could you not use terms like 'retard' in that context? It's offensive and kind of juvenile...
2014-08-04 22:05:29	@kennobaka	or maybe TI-BASIC, which is its own special, beautiful little hell
2014-08-04 22:07:14	Krampus	whopper: sure can't.
2014-08-04 22:07:37	Krampus	kennobaka: I really wish I'd learned Z-80 in high school.  Would have been awesome to develop for the TI.
2014-08-04 22:16:26	lewisrjc	hmm
2014-08-04 22:16:36	lewisrjc	nice 5 is looking like a factor of 10 markup
2014-08-04 22:16:54	clarkb	lewisrjc: the node must be busy doing other things then?
2014-08-04 22:17:09	lewisrjc	I will check in tomorrow but that makes this project infeasible...
2014-08-04 22:17:15	lewisrjc	clarkb: the "node" is ada
2014-08-04 22:17:23	clarkb	lewisrjc: ok?
2014-08-04 22:17:40	lewisrjc	so it's a conventional login box, but I don't know how many people use it
2014-08-04 22:18:10	lewisrjc	800 processes, 40 of which are mine
2014-08-04 22:18:38	lewisrjc	but 35 logins, 4 of which are me
2014-08-04 22:19:43	lewisrjc	I'm betting I am oversaturating the cores...
2014-08-04 22:19:49	clarkb	lewisrjc: top should show you hop much time it is spending with your niced processes
2014-08-04 22:20:08	clarkb	should be user, system, nice, idle, wait, etc
2014-08-04 22:20:30	clarkb	lewisrjc: 10x markup would mean only 10% nice?
2014-08-04 22:20:40	lewisrjc	wait...
2014-08-04 22:20:47	lewisrjc	WTF
2014-08-04 22:22:01	lewisrjc	why are only 2 processes running at time
2014-08-04 22:22:31	clarkb	is that what fits into the nice time?
2014-08-04 22:22:47	clarkb	remember the scheduler is going to give time slices to processes ready to run with better nice values
2014-08-04 22:23:01	clarkb	2 processes at a time may be all that is left over
2014-08-04 22:23:14	lewisrjc	no top says 2 tasks running
2014-08-04 22:23:28	lewisrjc	827 total 2 running 821 sleeping
2014-08-04 22:23:40	lewisrjc	3 stopped 2 zombie 
2014-08-04 22:24:51	clarkb	iowait?
2014-08-04 22:25:56	lewisrjc	shit
2014-08-04 22:25:57	clarkb	actually if you toggle the idle tasks in top your processes show up
2014-08-04 22:25:58	lewisrjc	contention
2014-08-04 22:26:37	lewisrjc	my processes are listed as 9+hours
2014-08-04 22:26:57	lewisrjc	I am having contention issues.
2014-08-04 22:27:11	lewisrjc	File IO is probably the issue?
2014-08-04 22:27:19	lewisrjc	SCOOBY DOO I CHOOSE YOU
2014-08-04 22:27:23	clarkb	a quick check doesn't show iowait but I wans't looking hard
2014-08-04 22:27:32	clarkb	lewisrjc: is 9 hours not long enough?
2014-08-04 22:27:43	lewisrjc	uh, if I just run 1 of them it took 2 hours
2014-08-04 22:28:07	lewisrjc	so these processes are getting 9 hours of user time on the processor and not doing what was done with 2 hours on the processor
2014-08-04 22:28:13	alevar	lewisrjc: Clearly you should rewrite it in Rust :P
2014-08-04 22:28:16	lewisrjc	but regardless, this won't work so I am going to kill it

2014-08-04 22:36:41	lewisrjc	pilgrimd: you mean ieee 754, which afaik isn't used anymore
2014-08-04 22:36:44	pilgrimd	clarkb: I learned fork bombs in CS162. CS163 was infinite loops and segfaults.
2014-08-04 22:36:46	lewisrjc	somewhat hilariously
2014-08-04 22:37:28	clarkb	pilgrimd: karla does not teach fork() in 16X
2014-08-04 22:37:33	lewisrjc	dear-cthulhu: I need to assign a result set to a line in matlab
2014-08-04 22:37:47	clarkb	pilgrimd: fork() was introduced to us in CS200 which does not exist anymore so I assume its 201 now
2014-08-04 22:37:58	lewisrjc	I could really use a bloody chalkboard right now
2014-08-04 22:38:13	lewisrjc	I am not smart enough to figure this out
2014-08-04 22:39:01	pilgrimd	clarkb: I didn't take CS162 at PSU.
2014-08-04 22:40:27	dear-cthulhu	lewisrjc: My watery prison does not have a good chalkboard.
2014-08-04 22:40:39	dear-cthulhu	It doesn't have good chalk either, for that matter.
2014-08-04 22:41:34	lewisrjc	dear-cthulhu: does matlab have dictionaries
2014-08-04 22:41:46	pilgrimd	dear-cthulhu: Funny, considering they make can chalk from sea life.
2014-08-04 22:41:48	lewisrjc	or whatever is allah's name they are called
2014-08-04 22:41:52	pilgrimd	*can make chalk
2014-08-04 22:42:15	dear-cthulhu	pilgrimd: It's not very usable down here.
2014-08-04 22:43:10	dear-cthulhu	lewisrjc: Do you mean containers.Map?

2014-08-04 22:44:27	lewisrjc	"hacky" leaps to mind
2014-08-04 22:44:33	lewisrjc	like, tacky level hacky
2014-08-04 22:44:38	dear-cthulhu	My watery prison has excellent Internet access.
2014-08-04 22:46:55	@kennobaka	undersea cables, amirite
2014-08-04 22:47:35	@kennobaka	lewisrjc: does that last statement about Cthulhu and intartubes make you as scared as me?
2014-08-04 22:47:52	@kennobaka	or is it that I just started rereading (Apocalypse Codex)++
2014-08-04 22:47:58	pilgrimd	kennobaka: The internet runs on cats in tubes. Cats hate water. Therefore, undersea tube cats move very quickly to make landfall.
2014-08-04 22:48:00	lewisrjc	I have a copy of that
2014-08-04 22:48:10	lewisrjc	I haven't been able to finsih it

2014-08-04 22:49:25	lewisrjc	did anyone know that  was a book first
2014-08-04 22:49:50	@kennobaka	I stopped reading at "inspiration for Monkey Island"
2014-08-04 22:49:57	@kennobaka	I'm sold and anything after that will just cheapen it
2014-08-04 22:50:00	lewisrjc	it actually explains the creation of the 4th book

2014-08-04 22:52:23	alevar	So that password cracker that I wrote a while ago for my computer security class...
2014-08-04 22:52:45	alevar	I ran it on ada with the thread count switched up to the number of cores.
2014-08-04 22:53:21	alevar	Ran in under 1.3 seconds. Yay threading and good optimizations \o/
2014-08-04 22:55:18	alevar	Granted, it takes 43 seconds of CPU time and wouldn't 
2014-08-04 22:55:34	alevar	be accepted because it takes more complex flags.

2014-08-04 23:17:30	lewisrjc	ahow can a process have 200% cpu utilazation?
2014-08-04 23:19:07	dear-cthulhu	lewisrjc: Multicore
2014-08-04 23:19:28	lewisrjc	is matlab actually
2014-08-04 23:19:31	lewisrjc	multicore?
2014-08-04 23:19:47	alevar	It might be able to parallelize some things.
2014-08-04 23:22:53	lewisrjc	yeah it looks like it has internal vectorization
2014-08-04 23:22:57	lewisrjc	that complicates things
2014-08-04 23:23:02	lewisrjc	immensely
2014-08-04 23:23:11	alevar	Oh?
2014-08-04 23:23:50	lewisrjc	since at full cpu utilzation it won't be able to vectorize
2014-08-04 23:24:01	lewisrjc	so I may need to halve my parralellization
2014-08-04 23:24:07	lewisrjc	and let matlab take over some of the lifting
2014-08-04 23:26:12	alevar	In other news, I am feeding flour and water to a mixture of flour and water right now.

2014-08-04 23:29:26	lewisrjc	alevar why would it be significanyly slower?
2014-08-04 23:29:37	lewisrjc	I would have many, many more threads (3 times as many)
2014-08-04 23:30:08	lewisrjc	chandra has a fairly competitive clockspeed (1.5? ghz?)
2014-08-04 23:30:16	alevar	But each would be slower
2014-08-04 23:30:21	lewisrjc	mm
2014-08-04 23:30:46	alevar	I forget, how do I figure out how many logical cores chandra has?
2014-08-04 23:31:03	lewisrjc	I am blind guess that ada is 2.5-3.0 ghz
2014-08-04 23:31:05	@kennobaka	64, iirc
2014-08-04 23:31:06	lewisrjc	nproc?
2014-08-04 23:31:32	@kennobaka	8 threads x 8 cores, but it might be 16 threads x 8 cores

2014-08-04 23:31:39	lewisrjc	64

2014-08-04 23:32:02	alevar	From what I can tell
2014-08-04 23:32:03	lewisrjc	the number of physical cores is also significant
2014-08-04 23:32:11	lewisrjc	alevar: that's hard to believe
2014-08-04 23:32:55	@kennobaka	if the number of cores matters on SPARC, you're Doing It Wrong(tm)
2014-08-04 23:33:06	alevar	You're right
2014-08-04 23:33:12	@kennobaka	i.e. optimize out your tail-recursion

2014-08-04 23:34:23	lewisrjc	oh wait
2014-08-04 23:34:29	lewisrjc	is ada virtual
2014-08-04 23:34:41	alevar	I'm counting 10 cores
2014-08-04 23:34:52	alevar	grep "core id" /proc/cpuinfo
2014-08-04 23:35:18	alevar	(note the lack of 5, 6, and 7
2014-08-04 23:35:57	alevar	That would make sense. 10 cores, 4 logical threads per core.
2014-08-04 23:37:42	lewisrjc	so 2 of the E5-2670 which have 6 live swap?
2014-08-04 23:37:50	lewisrjc	er hot swap spares or something?
2014-08-04 23:37:59	lewisrjc	oh yeah

2014-08-04 23:39:12	alevar	This is closer, but it says 20 threads, not 40
2014-08-04 23:39:49	lewisrjc	I think there are 2 of them
2014-08-04 23:40:11	lewisrjc	also wtf
2014-08-04 23:40:14	alevar	Ah, that would make sense
2014-08-04 23:40:26	lewisrjc	time gave me a wall clock of 50 mins, but the top was showing 80+mins
2014-08-04 23:40:40	alevar	top = CPU time
2014-08-04 23:40:55	lewisrjc	how can top time > real time?
2014-08-04 23:40:58	lewisrjc	Oh
2014-08-04 23:41:01	alevar	:)
2014-08-04 23:41:03	lewisrjc	split across 2 cores?
2014-08-04 23:41:17	alevar	yup
2014-08-04 23:41:37	alevar	2 threads going at full throttle = 2 x real time (approximately)
2014-08-04 23:41:49	lewisrjc	regardless that went from 118 real time to 50 real time
2014-08-04 23:41:51	alevar	Assuming nothing else running on the cores, which isn't true.
2014-08-04 23:41:54	lewisrjc	so even if i double it it's fine
2014-08-04 23:42:09	lewisrjc	so it says  49m59.77s real    56m12.88s user    50m20.10s system
2014-08-04 23:42:24	alevar	Wat
2014-08-04 23:42:31	alevar	That's.... that's a lot of system
2014-08-04 23:42:34	lewisrjc	does that mena it took 106 mins total?
2014-08-04 23:42:55	lewisrjc	jvm is disabled.
2014-08-04 23:43:08	lewisrjc	OHHHHH
2014-08-04 23:43:10	lewisrjc	FUCK
2014-08-04 23:43:11	lewisrjc	ME
2014-08-04 23:43:25	lewisrjc	THEY ARE DOING CROSS LANGUAGE IPC
2014-08-04 23:43:33	alevar	jvm?
2014-08-04 23:43:53	alevar	oh, ouch
2014-08-04 23:43:59	lewisrjc	matlab can tie into JVM
2014-08-04 23:44:01	alevar	That hurts
2014-08-04 23:44:14	lewisrjc	which like, doubles it's memory footprint and does other bad things, but gives good graphics
2014-08-04 23:44:30	lewisrjc	wow
2014-08-04 23:44:40	lewisrjc	literally the sum is worse than the parts
2014-08-04 23:44:45	lewisrjc	and the parts are pretty awful
2014-08-04 23:44:49	lewisrjc	that's actually impressive
2014-08-04 23:45:28	lewisrjc	but that does mean it took 106 minutes (assuming single core)
2014-08-04 23:45:29	lewisrjc	ish
2014-08-04 23:46:08	alevar	No
2014-08-04 23:46:14	alevar	50 real time
2014-08-04 23:46:15	alevar	oh
2014-08-04 23:46:18	alevar	nvm
2014-08-04 23:46:55	alevar	Took a second read. I think that's my signal that I should go to sleep.
2014-08-04 23:47:17	lewisrjc	yeah 50 realtime, slightly more than 2 times that processor time (which if uniprocessor we can assume slightly more than that for translation
2014-08-04 23:47:39	lewisrjc	yeah, they are making a bajillion exec calls and return that are super expensive I am guessing
2014-08-04 23:47:42	lewisrjc	that's
2014-08-04 23:47:45	lewisrjc	bad
2014-08-05 00:11:20	lewisrjc	alright
2014-08-05 00:11:25	lewisrjc	new system is up and running
2014-08-05 00:11:29	lewisrjc	let's see if this works

2014-08-05 10:06:17	alevar	bkero: It looks like we'll be using an IRC bouncer setup.
2014-08-05 10:06:55	alevar	ZNC, so that we can add a module that makes people join channels when invited.
2014-08-05 10:08:28	alevar	bip lacks any extension abilities
2014-08-05 10:32:19	alevar	Unfortunately, no Python module because RHEL/OEL 6.5 doesn't have a Python 3 package, period.
2014-08-05 10:32:53	alevar	Too new? Python 3.0 was only released a mere 6 years ago.
2014-08-05 10:36:08	bkero	Does RHEL 6 even have Python 2.7?
2014-08-05 10:36:26	alevar	IIRC, 2.6
2014-08-05 10:37:07	alevar	RHEL 7 has 2.7.5, with the current version being 2.7.8.
2014-08-05 10:37:48	clarkb	rhel6 has 2.7 if you pay for it
2014-08-05 10:38:03	alevar	Oh goody
2014-08-05 10:40:07	alevar	RHEL/OEL 7 has a Python 3 package, so we over at UTi will be able to use it some time within the next century or two.
2014-08-05 10:41:14	alevar	Not that I expect any Python code to be written here. It's a Java shop with a bit of (J)Ruby and some DSL's.
2014-08-05 10:41:56	bkero	Looks like the PUIAS Computational repo has Python 3 packaged for EL6
2014-08-05 10:45:44	alevar	Yup, but I doubt they will spring for that here.
2014-08-05 10:45:50	alevar	Not sure, but I doubt it.
2014-08-05 11:01:03	retrov	isn't python 3 in the SCL repos?
2014-08-05 11:03:50	alevar	yes
2014-08-05 11:03:54	alevar	http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL
2014-08-05 11:04:12	alevar	Oh, nice. Python 3.3.
2014-08-05 11:04:32	alevar	That's the version of Python that most projects have decided to target for porting.
2014-08-05 11:06:42	alevar	If you put u in front of a string literal (u"abcd") then it is a unicode string. It's a noop on Python 3, but it helps immensely with writing code that works on both versions of Python.
2014-08-05 11:07:19	alevar	u"asdf" always creates a unicode string. b"asdf" always creates a bytestring (Python >= 2.6)
2014-08-05 11:21:00	retrov	alevar: are you barred from using the SCL repos at work?
2014-08-05 11:22:15	alevar	I think there's a general feeling that we shouldn't use non-official repositories, but I would have to verify that.
2014-08-05 11:22:35	alevar	Not that that really applies to my Linux VM. Arch. :)
2014-08-05 11:24:06	alevar	Fortunately the Perl module for ZNC is simple enough that I could easily figure out how to deal with it.
2014-08-05 11:24:19	alevar	It's 10 lines of clean Perl. Nothing bad.
2014-08-05 13:01:28	uberj	jesusaurus: clarkb: have you guys seen etherpad lite have issues with large numbers of people on the same pad?
2014-08-05 13:01:49	uberj	wondering if it has similar problems to etherpad classic
2014-08-05 13:01:56	uberj	*stability problems
2014-08-05 13:05:19	clarkb	uberj: it definitely bogs down a bit. at the last summit in the operators track we hit it with a few hundred users
2014-08-05 13:05:36	clarkb	uberj: thankfully my proxy had been tested with a relatively high number of users too bceause it opens all the connections
2014-08-05 13:05:50	clarkb	uberj: the biggest performance thing has been once you get beyond a certain line count it gets derpy
2014-08-05 13:05:55	clarkb	I think sdague says ~700 for that
2014-08-05 13:06:27	uberj	okay
2014-08-05 13:22:11	greghaynes	It was crashing pretty hard on friday of the summit
2014-08-05 13:22:28	greghaynes	I figured because enough infra people were on planed and not poking at it regularly
2014-08-05 13:22:37	greghaynes	s/planed/planes
2014-08-05 13:42:51	clarkb	greghaynes: no that was the nodejs stack being too small
2014-08-05 13:43:07	clarkb	uberj: so ya you want to increase your nodejs stack size. we doubled the default whatever it was
2014-08-05 13:43:53	uberj	yeah, I don't get why they rewrote a java app in nodejs
2014-08-05 13:43:57	nightfly	:/ stack size should not be an issue with nodejs
2014-08-05 13:44:40	clarkb	nightfly: nodejs stack size is tiny
2014-08-05 13:44:52	clarkb	nightfly: I don't disagree that the node devs probably know what a reasonable default is
2014-08-05 13:45:07	clarkb	but have a few hundred users and etherpad-lite needs more stack
2014-08-05 13:45:31	clarkb	uberj: etherpad was terrible and dead
2014-08-05 13:45:37	nightfly	something should be changed to defer to the event loop more frequently
2014-08-05 13:45:40	bret	what is the /share folder for in unix?
2014-08-05 13:45:53	clarkb	uberj: the etherpad dev devs actually seems into the thing they are doing so meh
2014-08-05 13:46:28	clarkb	bret: tends to be data type stuff. man pages and other documentation. fonts, thumbnails etc
2014-08-05 13:47:00	bret	clarkb, i have a program called aclocal looking for macros in a /share/aclocal folder
2014-08-05 13:47:13	bret	err /usr/local/share/aclocal
2014-08-05 13:47:40	alevar	I have a feeling that there is a man page about that.
2014-08-05 13:47:44	alevar	I can't find it.
2014-08-05 13:48:18	bret	is there a way to set my envoronment so that programs look through another /share folder (ie ~/share)
2014-08-05 13:48:33	bret	similar to how I can prepend bin folders to my $PATH?
2014-08-05 13:49:10	clarkb	bret: it depends on the program. for example man respects MANPATH
2014-08-05 13:49:11	bret	hard question to google, everything is about nfs

2014-08-05 14:59:49	ghost	what would be a good online c-code learning resource for a self taught programmer to start on? i don't ask for myself, since i'm *comfortable* with karla's classes.
2014-08-05 15:00:49	clarkb	ghost: ansi C
2014-08-05 15:02:28	ghost	nevermind...
2014-08-05 15:03:05	nightfly	???
2014-08-05 15:03:51	clarkb	ghost: its actually really good imo
2014-08-05 15:04:06	clarkb	ghost: its direct and to the point and if you work through the examples and problems you learn quite a bit about C
2014-08-05 15:06:06	ghost	i thought you were talking about just reading the standard...are there learning resources that have the same name?

2014-08-05 15:06:41	clarkb	also "C Bible"
2014-08-05 15:06:57	ghost	ah...i've heard of that, and heard really good things too
2014-08-05 15:07:08	nightfly	 ghost if you don't have a copy I have one that could be borrowed

2014-08-05 15:10:34	ghost	nightfly: i appreciate the offer, but like i said, i'm comfortable with c, this is someone else looking to learn in an unstructured environment. i learned from karla, which is structured learning.
2014-08-05 15:11:16	clarkb	ghost: another thing that may help is starting with an arduino and going from there
2014-08-05 15:11:17	nightfly	Doesn't matter who it's for, it's just sitting here doing nothing
2014-08-05 15:11:22	ghost	they'
2014-08-05 15:11:24	clarkb	since the arduino has a ton of simple examples and its basically C
2014-08-05 15:11:36	ghost	they're actually using an arduino... :-)
2014-08-05 15:12:11	ghost	but they do web code, like html and such.
2014-08-05 15:12:34	ghost	so C is a new thing to them.
2014-08-05 15:13:15	ghost	that book should point them in the right direction, thanks nightfly++ clarkb++ 
2014-08-05 15:14:56	ghost	nightfly: i don't want to borrow your copy and then lend it to someone else...that's a receipe for disaster via lack of accountability. they've got a successful web design going, they can buy the book. but thank you!
2014-08-05 15:17:33	greghaynes	They should just learn node if they want to feel close to the metal
2014-08-05 15:18:04	clarkb	but only x86 metal
2014-08-05 15:18:09	clarkb	node doesn't do other types of metal
2014-08-05 15:18:17	nibalizer	not sure about that
2014-08-05 15:18:24	clarkb	nibalizer: did they fix that?
2014-08-05 15:18:26	nibalizer	it was joyent who made node after all
2014-08-05 15:18:33	nibalizer	and those guys are all sun nerds
2014-08-05 15:18:41	clarkb	it is based on chrome's js engine which is x86 only
2014-08-05 15:18:44	nibalizer	if they didn't make it work on sparc that would suprise me
2014-08-05 15:19:10	clarkb	looks like it does work on arm now thats cool

2014-08-05 22:07:12	clarkb	retrov: its very true. when you run a lot of tests those test can't fail very often or you get cranky
2014-08-05 22:07:35	retrov	just setting up and tearing down test environments quickly and easily is a necessity
2014-08-05 22:07:47	clarkb	yup
2014-08-05 22:08:21	clarkb	though "easy" is relative we haev found
2014-08-05 22:08:35	clarkb	make it as easy as running `tox` and people will find some reason that is impractical
2014-08-05 22:08:37	clarkb	:(
2014-08-05 22:09:17	retrov	what's tox?

2014-08-05 22:37:56	mythmon	kini: it's been tempting me for a little while.
2014-08-05 22:39:08	kini	in march I was convinced by a few people that I had reached the age where I should no longer be a young whippersnapper running arch or gentoo and running into multiple exciting new bugs every day, but should instead retire to the comfort and security and set-it-and-forget-it-ness of debian
2014-08-05 22:39:40	mythmon	how's that going for you?
2014-08-05 22:39:56	kini	turns out debian has its share of bugs too (though maybe not as much as gentoo did, to be fair), but when debian has a bug you have to compete for package maintainers' attention with 999 idiots saying "FIREFOX DOESNT WORK"
2014-08-05 22:40:08	kini	I still haven't gotten a single response to a single email I've ever sent to the debian bug tracker
2014-08-05 22:40:18	mythmon	that sounds worse.
2014-08-05 22:40:21	kini	so now I'm starting to sulk
2014-08-05 22:40:30	kini	and thereby my attention has turned back to bleeding edge distros
2014-08-05 22:40:32	kini	lol
2014-08-05 22:40:47	mythmon	i got a lesson in "computers always break always" today.
2014-08-05 22:40:53	mythmon	only half of which was related to arch.
2014-08-05 22:40:54	clarkb	I like being somewhere in the middle
2014-08-05 22:41:09	mythmon	clarkb: if you say "ubuntu"...
2014-08-05 22:41:14	clarkb	mythmon that is a variant of everythung is terrible
2014-08-05 22:41:24	clarkb	mythmon or similar
2014-08-05 22:41:43	mythmon	in particular, my laptop decided it wasn't going to boot. error at post, and then shut down.
2014-08-05 22:41:51	kini	oh good
2014-08-05 22:41:53	clarkb	I use xubuntu now. work with several of the xubuntu folk
2014-08-05 22:42:03	mythmon	solution as advocated by IT dept.: remove SSD from laptop A, insert into laptop B, move on.
2014-08-05 22:42:10	kini	clarkb: on xubuntu? or just coincidentally, on something else?
2014-08-05 22:42:26	clarkb	kini on other things
2014-08-05 22:42:36	kini	cool
2014-08-05 22:42:44	kini	I have kubuntu on an old laptop of mine
2014-08-05 22:42:57	kini	which I keep on top of my piano and use as a sheet music reader
2014-08-05 22:43:03	clarkb	but no unity or wayland alternative. its great
2014-08-05 22:43:03	mythmon	clarkb: i've been told that nixos is "gentoo users' gentoo" in terms of whippersnapperness
2014-08-05 22:43:07	kini	it works... I guess...
2014-08-05 22:43:22	kini	nixos is really really interesting IMO
2014-08-05 22:43:43	mythmon	i only know it's theory. it does seem really really interesting.
2014-08-05 22:43:50	kini	the package manager / package management system is brilliant
2014-08-05 22:44:03	kini	the current "canonical" package repository doesn't make use of its full potential though, it seems like
2014-08-05 22:44:17	kini	but you can override things very easily
2014-08-05 22:44:17	kini	like
2014-08-05 22:44:23	kini	in gentoo, ebuilds have useflags, and you pick what useflags you want
2014-08-05 22:44:30	clarkb	I would give fedora a shot if it wasnt always broken
2014-08-05 22:44:53	kini	in nix you have to instead override attributes of the nix expression for the package (for example by adding "--with-foo=bar" to the configure params attribute, or whatever)
2014-08-05 22:45:12	clarkb	debian runs on the box that gives me this irc connection. seems good for that
2014-08-05 22:45:15	kini	so it's a little bit more "manual" in that sense but also more powerful since you don't have to stick to whatever use flags the maintainers decided to set up
2014-08-05 22:46:25	mythmon	I never really used gentoo, but I still miss USE flags. pretty brilliant imo. too bad compiling takes forever.
2014-08-05 22:46:35	kini	also nixos is derived from nix, whereas gentoo portage is derived from gentoo
2014-08-05 22:46:46	kini	by which I mean that setting up nix in your homedir on another distro is a breeze
2014-08-05 22:46:47	mythmon	i don't know what you mean by that.
2014-08-05 22:46:52	mythmon	ah
2014-08-05 22:46:52	kini	unlike setting up gentoo in your homedir on another distro
2014-08-05 22:47:04	mythmon	so wait, what is nix and what is nixos?
2014-08-05 22:47:09	mythmon	is nix nixos's package manager?
2014-08-05 22:47:11	kini	nix is a package management system
2014-08-05 22:47:23	kini	nixos is an operating system whose systemwide packages are provided by the nix package management system
2014-08-05 22:47:24	mythmon	interesting.
2014-08-05 22:47:54	mythmon	this may come in handy later. i will remember this.
2014-08-05 22:48:31	clarkb	but its also basically a distro with built in config mgmt
2014-08-05 22:48:39	kini	yup
2014-08-05 22:48:57	kini	haven't really looked into how exactly that works yet though
2014-08-05 22:48:57	clarkb	which is cool until you realize everyone has one of those already
2014-08-05 22:49:01	clarkb	maybe two
2014-08-05 22:49:06	kini	lol
2014-08-05 22:49:17	kini	well with nix I don't think the config management is the main point of it
2014-08-05 22:49:21	clarkb	we currently use puppet and ansible so ya
2014-08-05 22:50:09	kini	the main point of it is something like gentoo's "slots" concept but in mega overdrive
2014-08-05 22:51:21	kini	nix patches all nix-installed ELF binaries so that they load specific hashed versions of libraries, for example
2014-08-05 22:51:42	clarkb	the multiuser package management is cool
2014-08-05 22:51:52	kini	yeah that too
2014-08-05 22:52:00	clarkb	would be good for envs like the cat run
2014-08-05 22:52:06	kini	since package installation works by just dumping a totally deterministic subdir in /nix/store
2014-08-05 22:52:17	kini	and not touching anything else
2014-08-05 22:57:55	alevar	lewisrjc: You need more matlab processes
2014-08-05 22:59:51	alevar	If you're rerunning it, you might want to decrease the number of processes to about 20. It looks like MATLAB can parallelize some stuff, so the processes are fighting over cores/virtual cores

2014-08-06 10:48:45	nibalizer	Krampus: if we work on a project
2014-08-06 10:48:49	nibalizer	and you make something email me about todos
2014-08-06 10:48:57	nibalizer	i will block that email addr
2014-08-06 10:54:26	Krampus	nibalizer: nah, not email the committer.  Basically a once a month or so summary so that we aren't forgetting to go back and fix shit.
2014-08-06 10:55:02	@krinkle	stop leaving TODOs in your code and use a ticket tracker
2014-08-06 10:55:24	clarkb	todos in code are not bad necessarily
2014-08-06 10:55:58	clarkb	it keeps stuff close to code so that when you refactor or whatever work gets done
2014-08-06 10:56:08	@krinkle	i hate looking at TODOs and FIXMEs in production code that no one has touched in years
2014-08-06 10:56:39	clarkb	actual bugs and real issues should be properly tracked
2014-08-06 10:58:27	Krampus	krinkle: we have a ticket tracker.  We don't have good software processes.  We're working on fixing that, but we have a *lot* of legacy to deal with.
2014-08-06 10:59:03	Krampus	and TODO / FIXME / XXX are fine for what we do.  A lot of them are driven by hardware design being broken and we have to work around it until the design is fixed.

2014-08-06 11:24:13	retrov	original story about hte monkey stealing the camera: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8615859/Monkey-steals-camera-to-snap-himself.html

2014-08-06 13:20:38	lewisrjc	alevar: In retrospect yes that is likely, but in a perfect world I will never have to run this test again
2014-08-06 13:20:47	lewisrjc	the goal is a negative result.
2014-08-06 13:21:24	lewisrjc	and we have a good track for the 15 days, so I am pretty sure I just let it spin and move on with my life
2014-08-06 13:23:50	lewisrjc	hmm
2014-08-06 13:23:55	lewisrjc	this is going to be 125 gigs...
2014-08-06 13:24:12	lewisrjc	eh, I will collapse the dir in a week, that should keep some free space available.
2014-08-06 14:12:08	alevar	125 of what?
2014-08-06 14:12:17	alevar	text?
2014-08-06 14:12:23	lewisrjc	yup
2014-08-06 14:12:23	alevar	Or something less compressible
2014-08-06 14:12:26	lewisrjc	no
2014-08-06 14:12:32	lewisrjc	raw, very repetetive text
2014-08-06 14:12:40	alevar	Oh, delicious
2014-08-06 14:12:41	lewisrjc	I expext it to compress at least 2 x
2014-08-06 14:13:03	alevar	Easily, in come cases.
2014-08-06 14:13:16	lewisrjc	like,theres 180 gigs+ left on the stash, so it's not a problem, I just need to make sure I don't get in the way of other peoples work
2014-08-06 14:13:43	alevar	ah

2014-08-06 14:47:39	nightfly	lewisrjc: what stash? zfs compression might already be helping you out
2014-08-06 14:53:02	alevar	nibalizer: I do love me some automatic compression
2014-08-06 14:53:07	alevar	Also present on btrfs
2014-08-06 14:54:06	nightfly	lol tab complete
2014-08-06 15:03:53	alevar	Sometimes I wish Java just crashed hard on NullPointerExceptions so that people would fix their code.
2014-08-06 15:04:34	alevar	As in, no catching the NullPointerException and continuing on with the program.
2014-08-06 15:05:56	blkperl	that doesn't sound very enterpisey
2014-08-06 15:07:45	alevar	Yeah, I know. :(
2014-08-06 15:08:34	alevar	Right now I'm looking at a traceback from a NullPointerException and thinking "why the hell did you recover from that?"
2014-08-06 15:12:46	retrov	is btrfs stable enough yet?
2014-08-06 15:13:23	alevar	I think the official line is don't use it for mission critical stuff (servers), but it's probably okay.
2014-08-06 15:13:54	alevar	That information is a couple of months old, though.
2014-08-06 15:14:34	clarkb	retrov: ceph says no
2014-08-06 15:34:58	jesusaurus	clarkb: is ceph stable yet?
2014-08-06 15:35:31	clarkb	jesusaurus: for block and object storage
2014-08-06 15:50:16	lewisrjc	nightfly: doesn't look like it. The files are actually 25megs of text
2014-08-06 15:50:39	lewisrjc	so ls -h isn't lying, if ZFS takes care of compression that's great
2014-08-06 15:51:10	 *	lewisrjc it occurs how many terrible, terrible design decisions I have made to have to get to this point.
2014-08-06 15:53:12	alevar	lewisrjc: Is it written in ant?
2014-08-06 15:53:20	lewisrjc	alevar: nope
2014-08-06 15:53:34	alevar	Well, you picked a good choice on something at least.
2014-08-06 15:53:46	lewisrjc	it's shell scripts calling matlab calling C
2014-08-06 15:54:02	nightfly	wasn't there java in there somewhere?
2014-08-06 15:54:10	lewisrjc	with some pre-processing by java, and postprocessing by Haskell
2014-08-06 15:54:11	alevar	With excessive IPC?
2014-08-06 15:54:15	 *	lewisrjc is a grad student
2014-08-06 15:54:23	lewisrjc	alevar: both excessive and poorly made
2014-08-06 15:54:27	 *	alevar pats lewisrjc on the head
2014-08-06 15:54:33	alevar	good little grad student
2014-08-06 15:56:59	clarkb	lewisrjc: you need to find an undergrad student to figure this stuff out for you
2014-08-06 15:57:04	clarkb	lewisrjc: pretty sure that is how this works
2014-08-06 15:57:14	lewisrjc	um
2014-08-06 15:57:33	lewisrjc	oddly enough I think grad students are actually bottom of the barrel
2014-08-06 15:57:54	clarkb	I dunno, I did my fair share of work for grad students at psu
2014-08-06 15:57:54	lewisrjc	undergrads are too inexperienced to be real useful most of the time, and they also usually are worth more money to the school
2014-08-06 15:58:14	clarkb	wait how are undergrads worth more?
2014-08-06 15:58:33	lewisrjc	the dolla bills?
2014-08-06 15:58:49	alevar	lewisrjc: I'd like to see a comparison between the average grad student and the average undergrad student.
2014-08-06 15:59:00	lewisrjc	a grad degree is less than a guarter of the number of credits
2014-08-06 15:59:08	clarkb	lewisrjc: but they cost a lot more
2014-08-06 15:59:22	lewisrjc	even though they cost more, it's not 4 times as much
2014-08-06 15:59:29	lewisrjc	I think it's 1.5 times
2014-08-06 15:59:36	alevar	That sounds right
2014-08-06 15:59:41	bkero	alevar: intel estimates it is worth $10k/year
2014-08-06 15:59:58	clarkb	it?
2014-08-06 16:00:06	bkero	That's MBA or MS in EE or CS
2014-08-06 16:00:23	clarkb	bkero: you talking salary?
2014-08-06 16:00:28	bkero	clarkb: yup
2014-08-06 16:01:23	lewisrjc	uh, according to the cost breakdown tuition for a ug/res is 4k less than a gr res, while gr/non-res is actually cheaper than an ug non-res
2014-08-06 16:01:29	lewisrjc	that doesn't make sense thugh
2014-08-06 16:02:09	lewisrjc	oh, wow, it's actually more than 2x for a grad credit
2014-08-06 16:02:14	lewisrjc	it's less than 3 though
2014-08-06 16:02:29	clarkb	its pricey
2014-08-06 16:02:33	clarkb	there are raisins I didn't do it
2014-08-06 16:02:48	lewisrjc	wow
2014-08-06 16:02:59	lewisrjc	undergrad courses at portland state are really cheap
2014-08-06 16:03:05	clarkb	"cheap"
2014-08-06 16:03:17	lewisrjc	145 a credit hour?
2014-08-06 16:03:22	clarkb	my first full time year cost about half of what a full time year costs now
2014-08-06 16:03:48	tamgc	but back then you had to walk uphill both ways in snow
2014-08-06 16:03:57	lewisrjc	just tuition or is that including room and board?
2014-08-06 16:04:06	lewisrjc	because room and board are EXPENSIVE
2014-08-06 16:04:19	clarkb	lewisrjc: it was everything required to take classes so not room and board but mandatory fees
2014-08-06 16:04:38	lewisrjc	the tuition and fees are almost the same for grad and undergrad
2014-08-06 16:05:02	lewisrjc	clarkb: for reference PSU is 45$ more per credit than PCC
2014-08-06 16:05:21	lewisrjc	for resident tution
2014-08-06 16:06:04	alevar	And then there's http://www.reed.edu/apply/tuition.html
2014-08-06 16:06:59	lewisrjc	hmm
2014-08-06 16:07:24	lewisrjc	my entire degree cost less than a year at Reed
2014-08-06 16:07:33	alevar	Yeah... it's all relative.
2014-08-06 16:07:51	alevar	Reed does give very generous scholarships, but still.
2014-08-06 16:07:57	lewisrjc	anyways, I got to go work out
2014-08-06 16:08:00	lewisrjc	take care yall
2014-08-06 16:08:02	edunham	oO damn, Reed is pricey
2014-08-06 16:08:26	tamgc	at least that's semester and not quarterly
2014-08-06 16:09:47	clarkb	edunham: that is pretty typical for private schools
2014-08-06 16:09:56	clarkb	edunham: UP and Lewis and Clark are up there too
2014-08-06 16:10:14	clarkb	oh and pacific
2014-08-06 16:10:15	zacharyp	holy crap, I just looked at UCSC fees.  They are crazy compared to when I went there
2014-08-06 16:10:24	alevar	I transfered from University of Puget Sound partially because of that.
2014-08-06 16:10:29	zacharyp	~$15800 a year
2014-08-06 16:10:38	clarkb	I didn't even apply to a private school because of it
2014-08-06 16:10:49	clarkb	zacharyp: ouch. UW is crazy expensive for residents too
2014-08-06 16:12:21	zacharyp	schools have become such a money making institution
2014-08-06 16:12:32	zacharyp	well, money charging, since they are no longer publicly funded
2014-08-06 16:14:25	clarkb	MLS all star game starts in about 2 hours in portland
2014-08-06 16:16:03	nibalizer	ya
2014-08-06 16:16:08	nibalizer	i dont get the all star game
2014-08-06 16:16:42	nibalizer	can we beat a team we chose to play?
2014-08-06 16:16:47	nibalizer	like wtf
2014-08-06 16:16:52	clarkb	nibalizer: yes?
2014-08-06 16:16:56	nibalizer	such artificial conflict
2014-08-06 16:17:14	clarkb	nibalizer: basically MLS plays during everyone else's offseason
2014-08-06 16:17:23	clarkb	so this is a preseason game for the away team
2014-08-06 16:17:29	clarkb	and everyone gets drunk
2014-08-06 16:17:34	nibalizer	uh okay
2014-08-06 16:17:37	nibalizer	but its some random team
2014-08-06 16:17:48	nibalizer	like they probably picked one we might be able to beat but its close
2014-08-06 16:17:53	clarkb	well one of the best in the world
2014-08-06 16:18:00	nibalizer	at least in baseball its american vs national
2014-08-06 16:18:04	clarkb	half of that team just won a world cup
2014-08-06 16:18:14	nibalizer	oh
2014-08-06 16:18:21	nibalizer	i thought this was like some derpy city team
2014-08-06 16:18:41	clarkb	bayern munich is legit
2014-08-06 16:18:50	clarkb	don't expect them to play many of their normal starting lineup
2014-08-06 16:18:59	clarkb	they may get some time though. this game allows a ton of subs
2014-08-06 16:19:21	nibalizer	so we're gonna lose to the b team from munich?
2014-08-06 16:19:39	nibalizer	there is a giant inflated soccer ball on top of the oregonian building
2014-08-06 16:19:56	clarkb	yes that is exactly what you should expect to happen
2014-08-06 16:20:29	tamgc	quick, poke a hole in it
2014-08-06 16:20:31	clarkb	looks like the german world cup members of the team will not be playing
2014-08-06 16:20:35	clarkb	but they will be at the event
2014-08-06 16:20:49	clarkb	er wait
2014-08-06 16:20:53	clarkb	maybe that was just their last game
2014-08-06 16:23:13	clarkb	in any case it should be fun
2014-08-06 16:23:24	clarkb	I need to find a stream of the game bceause espn-- is carrying it
2014-08-06 16:34:45	clarkb	nibalizer: as long as the final score is better than 7-1 we should be happy right?
2014-08-06 16:34:49	clarkb	(poor brazil)

2014-09-23 09:55:36	clarkb	does destiny not do cross platform mp?
2014-09-23 09:55:59	clarkb	seems like we are in the future now and if two consoles based on what is basically the same amd hardware can't figure out how to talk to each other then wtf
2014-09-23 10:17:19	MaddHatter	itym do ms and sony allow shared access to each others' servers
2014-09-23 10:17:35	MaddHatter	and I'd be surprised if that answer were yes
2014-09-23 10:17:58	clarkb	MaddHatter: games have in the past allowed cross talk
2014-09-23 10:18:01	clarkb	MaddHatter: so I think they must
2014-09-23 10:18:23	MaddHatter	hm. I am surprised, then.
2014-09-23 10:19:07	clarkb	it is a very uncommon feature though
2014-09-23 10:19:41	clarkb	was it portal 2 that allowed it at least for ps3 <-> pc?
2014-09-23 10:20:09	clarkb	thought maybe sony allows it and ms didnt? would fall in line with why valve is suepr angry at them
2014-09-23 10:20:24	clarkb	angry enough to make games on linux a thing
2014-09-23 10:22:27	+askore	there was a final fantasy mmo that allowed ps3 <-> pc
2014-09-23 10:27:14	clarkb	askore: was that not the one that also ended up on 360? /me does research

2014-09-23 10:27:32	+askore	it's very possible
2014-09-23 10:28:10	clarkb	looks like 11 allowed it

2014-09-23 19:53:06	nightfly	we found a work around. if you clear the nfsidmap cache before entries expire things seem to go okay. that combined with a larger cache 
2014-09-23 19:53:58	clarkb	nightfly: why don't you just stop caching?
2014-09-23 20:24:23	clarkb	ok so I have moved recently and I went from amazing small local isp in seattle that offers 100mbps and 1gbps service to comcast. Tonight I am really noticing that packets crossing L3 have an almost 50% chance of being bitbucketed. Am I am the only person this is happening to? I can't be
2014-09-23 20:24:38	clarkb	assuming I am not. How have we/us/you put up with this?
2014-09-23 20:26:02	clarkb	not only that but some of my packets need >6 seconds to go from portland to chicago and back
2014-09-23 20:26:21	clarkb	it takes less time to go to japan and back

2014-09-23 20:42:35	pyro	how is public transport?
2014-09-23 20:43:05	clarkb	pyro: public transit depends. where are you headed?
2014-09-23 20:43:50	clarkb	and driving on wrong side of road is apparently not terrible. but having passengered I wouldnt be comfortyable doing it
2014-09-23 20:45:22	pyro	new york, boston, michigan, massechuesets, apperently. i don't know anything about them and apologise if i screwed up the spelling. a friend has a wedding
2014-09-23 20:48:11	clarkb	new york city and boston will have great pubic transit
2014-09-23 20:48:33	clarkb	michigan probably not so good. its car country
2014-09-23 20:48:41	clarkb	(they build cars there)
2014-09-23 20:48:45	clarkb	or did
2014-09-23 20:49:23	pyro	cheers
2014-09-23 20:50:13	pyro	i am excited becuase i might go to a place called ann arbor and i bought tea from an online shop there once before :-P
2014-09-23 20:54:30	clarkb	pyro: ann arbor is less likely to have good public transit but its a college town so ma ybe walkable?
2014-09-23 20:55:05	clarkb	but ya cities like new york and boston will have amazing public transit and you probably don't want to drive in them
2014-09-23 20:55:12	clarkb	definitely don' drive in new york
2014-09-23 20:55:22	pyro	makes sense
2014-09-23 20:59:28	clarkb	pyro: when I went to au I was with another MURICAN that took to driving just fine
2014-09-23 20:59:43	clarkb	pyro: but I found that all of your expectations are wrong and you look the wrong way etc
2014-09-23 20:59:58	clarkb	whcih to me was really disconcerting because it felt like if I was driving it would totally be unsafe
2014-09-23 21:00:10	clarkb	also you do silly things in au like no lefts on red
2014-09-23 21:00:25	clarkb	so the rules are different in other ways too
2014-09-23 21:03:30	pyro	no lefts on red?
2014-09-23 21:03:34	pyro	that's not true
2014-09-23 21:03:52	clarkb	hrm it was in perth
2014-09-23 21:04:10	pyro	perth don't count, west is a seperate country :D
2014-09-23 21:04:41	clarkb	also if you are in ann arbor in the fall go see a university of michigan football game in the big house
2014-09-23 21:05:17	pyro	i've been to a place that does things the wrong way around, and was on a motorbike, but only briefly and only on a very quiet road. i found that being a pedestrian was tricky, always looked the wrong way
2014-09-23 21:05:32	pyro	it'll be around janurary i think
2014-09-23 21:05:57	clarkb	that will liekly be too late unless they host a bowl game
2014-09-23 21:06:10	clarkb	however your chance for snow is super high :P
2014-09-23 21:06:15	pyro	:D
2014-09-23 21:06:23	pyro	oh, i have also never driven in snow
2014-09-23 21:06:28	pyro	is it dangerous?
2014-09-23 21:06:34	clarkb	it can be
2014-09-23 21:06:35	pyro	snow is a mythical beast
2014-09-23 21:06:44	clarkb	on this side of the country it is because no one knows how to and it gets really icy
2014-09-23 21:07:05	clarkb	in the midwest its better because ice is apparently less of a problem and everyone has been driving in snow since forever
2014-09-23 21:07:51	pyro	i shall have to look at a map to make sense of this
2014-09-23 21:08:07	pyro	but i can't do that at work :D
2014-09-23 21:08:30	clarkb	portland on average does not get much snow
2014-09-23 21:09:25	clarkb	ann arbor average almost 5 feet (1.5 ish meters) of snow a year
2014-09-23 21:11:25	pyro	is that the depth that falls, or the depth of the pile?
2014-09-23 21:11:49	clarkb	pyro: its like measuring rain. So its the depth that has fallen all added up
2014-09-23 21:11:52	pyro	if there is a 5 feet pile, you surely can't drive a normal car at all :D
2014-09-23 21:12:03	clarkb	piles can be much bigger or smaller depending on how it is tended and wind and so on
2014-09-23 21:13:29	pyro	greghaynes is trying to make me go to a linux conference in auckland
2014-09-23 21:13:44	clarkb	I am hoping to go too. LCA is amazing
2014-09-23 21:13:54	clarkb	and linux australia is a great group of people
2014-09-23 21:14:00	pyro	i have never been to a conference of any sort :D
2014-09-23 21:14:46	clarkb	LCA's set up is great. They do summer in the southern hemisphere usually in australia but 2015 will be aukland. They have local LUGS or other groups bid for the conference then host at a local university
2014-09-23 21:15:05	clarkb	they give you the option to crash in dorms while everyone is on holidays so it can be pretty cheap to attend when compared to other conference
2014-09-23 21:15:07	clarkb	s
2014-09-23 21:15:34	clarkb	and they get people like poettering, bdale, linus, and so on to attend
2014-09-23 21:15:53	pyro	hm
2014-09-23 21:16:10	clarkb	I think 2016 will be in geelong?
2014-09-23 21:16:15	pyro	but what's there to do there? :-P
2014-09-23 21:16:25	pyro	oh, really?
2014-09-23 21:16:29	clarkb	attend talks, drink with people, hack, etc
2014-09-23 21:16:38	clarkb	ya I want to say that is what they announced in perth
2014-09-23 21:17:06	pyro	do you know geelong?
2014-09-23 21:17:12	clarkb	its on the gold coast?
2014-09-23 21:17:21	clarkb	I am not super familiar but its a burb of melbourne?
2014-09-23 21:17:50	pyro	faar from the gold coast. it's the second largest city in victoria, after melbourne
2014-09-23 21:18:40	clarkb	matthew garret gave two great talks at the last one. bdales talk on disaster recovery is a must watch
2014-09-23 21:18:53	pyro	not a really nice place to be honest. they are struggling work out what to do there currently after the car companies all packed up
2014-09-23 21:19:15	pyro	there is cash floating around that city, but no employment

2014-09-23 21:20:18	pyro	see, my thought has always been that the best parts of talks will always end up on the internet anyway
2014-09-23 21:20:18	clarkb	seriously everyone watch that video
2014-09-23 21:20:24	pyro	whats good about going in person?

2014-09-24 13:46:24	uberj	it still blows my mind that puppet can't recursively create a directory path
2014-09-24 13:48:30	jesusaurus	uberj: i know... but i guess theyre prioritizing things like writing a language spec
2014-09-24 13:51:17	uberj	so weird
2014-09-24 14:09:29	alevar	clarkb: Rust tries to make FFI reasonably easy and its stdlib is mostly written in Rust, so it has to have unsafe pointers.
2014-09-24 14:10:26	alevar	The standard way to deal with that is have anything unsafe kept highly isolated behind a safe interface.
2014-09-24 14:10:38	clarkb	alevar: I wasn't talking about Rust but interesting that other languages act like unsafe pointers need to be quit beause evil but then keep a stash of unsafe pointer packs in the bathroom cabinets
2014-09-24 14:10:42	alevar	Ah
2014-09-24 14:11:10	alevar	 Isn't that still a requirement for anything low level?

2014-09-24 14:11:48	clarkb	yes, see my earlier comment though
2014-09-24 14:11:59	clarkb	I don't like the idea that we can pretend fire is not hot
2014-09-24 14:12:10	clarkb	you either have the complexity and it burns or you don't
2014-09-24 14:13:33	nightfly	bkero: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
2014-09-24 14:14:07	clarkb	alevar: it more bothered me that guy in the talk was all "pointers are complex and they break you" "but screw that I want and need them"
2014-09-24 14:14:13	clarkb	alevar: I can't comment on rust's stance
2014-09-24 14:14:27	clarkb	alevar: this was also one of the reasons C was apparently bad
2014-09-24 14:14:33	alevar	Ah
2014-09-24 14:14:34	clarkb	alevar: buts its ok in my new mythical language
2014-09-24 14:15:01	alevar	In the part you saw, did Rust get a mention?
2014-09-24 14:15:10	clarkb	no
2014-09-24 14:15:26	alevar	I didn't think it would, just curious.
2014-09-24 14:19:27	clarkb	I don't have a problem with pointers. I just don't like pretending they aren't a thing you need to worry about when lagnuages expose them
2014-09-24 14:19:43	bkero	uberj, jesusaurus: puppet decided there wasn't a correct solution, so they didn't do anything. There's a REALLY old bug
2014-09-24 14:19:56	uberj	86
2014-09-24 14:19:57	clarkb	hell even when languages don't properly expose them you can get burned. java null pointer exceptions are such a pita
2014-09-24 14:20:01	clarkb	bkero: mkdir -p was too hard?
2014-09-24 14:20:34	bkero	clarkb: who should it be owned by?
2014-09-24 14:20:35	uberj	clarkb: thats not the point
2014-09-24 14:20:50	clarkb	bkero: file resources have owner and group glags
2014-09-24 14:20:53	alevar	clarkb: Extra points when the expected behavior for a vendor's software is a null pointer exception
2014-09-24 14:20:54	clarkb	or parameters
2014-09-24 14:21:27	bkero	It is bug #86
2014-09-24 14:21:29	bkero	https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/86
2014-09-24 14:21:45	clarkb	I am losing a lot of faith in puppet development. maybe finch can fix that
2014-09-24 14:21:52	clarkb	my --puppetdlockfile disappeared
2014-09-24 14:22:07	clarkb	and we are spedning time rewriting servers in clojure instead of using a botnet as a botnet
2014-09-24 14:22:21	bkero	Didn't you upgrade a major version number?
2014-09-24 14:22:28	clarkb	bkero: yes
2014-09-24 14:22:34	clarkb	so backward incompatiblity is expected
2014-09-24 14:22:35	bkero	and a flag changed?
2014-09-24 14:22:40	clarkb	bkero: no its completely gone
2014-09-24 14:22:52	bkero	Didn't nibalizer find it for you last night?
2014-09-24 14:22:58	clarkb	bkero: no those looked different
2014-09-24 14:23:01	clarkb	they were agent related
2014-09-24 14:23:11	clarkb	puppetdlockfile was everything related
2014-09-24 14:23:25	bkero	Isn't puppetd the agent?
2014-09-24 14:23:36	clarkb	bkero: ya, I mean its the same flag for all the things
2014-09-24 14:23:56	clarkb	whereas the new things seem more granular but remove the I don't want to think flag as an option
2014-09-24 14:24:04	bkero	lol
2014-09-24 14:25:01	bkero	Does 'puppetd' even exist anymore?
2014-09-24 14:25:15	clarkb	I dunno. I would be fine with a renamed flag
2014-09-24 14:25:38	nibalizer	clarkb: wat
2014-09-24 14:25:48	clarkb	agent_catalog_lockfile <- I don't even what does that lock?
2014-09-24 14:25:54	clarkb	vs agent_disabled_lockfile same question
2014-09-24 14:25:59	bkero	So...puppetd got replaced with the 'puppet agent' face.
2014-09-24 14:26:04	clarkb	I want the flag that says use X as teh global lock
2014-09-24 14:26:12	clarkb	I havne't found that
2014-09-24 14:26:19	jesusaurus	clarkb: the disabled lockfile is for puppet agent --disabled
2014-09-24 14:26:29	jesusaurus	clarkb: its good that they separated the two
2014-09-24 14:26:33	clarkb	jesusaurus: no thats different
2014-09-24 14:26:39	clarkb	jesusaurus: that says lock puppet
2014-09-24 14:26:51	clarkb	jesusaurus: I need to be able to run puppet while it is in that state by supplying an alternate lockfile
2014-09-24 14:26:52	nibalizer	clarkb: im srsly loling
2014-09-24 14:27:01	clarkb	nibalizer: ? ok
2014-09-24 14:27:32	nibalizer	the touch puppetdlockfile was a hack
2014-09-24 14:27:33	clarkb	so when you run puppet automagically as a cron or a daemon or ansible thing, you need a way of making that stuff stop. Use puppet aegnt --disable
2014-09-24 14:27:42	clarkb	nibalizer: I am not doing that either
2014-09-24 14:27:43	nibalizer	and you can continue doing that hack with agent_disabled_lockfile
2014-09-24 14:28:01	clarkb	now if I want to manually run puppet either in noop mode or just babysit it I need a way to say no really use a different lock file so that puppet runs
2014-09-24 14:28:09	clarkb	that was puppet agent --puppetdlockfile=/tmp/foo
2014-09-24 14:28:23	clarkb	I do not know how to replicate that
2014-09-24 14:28:24	nibalizer	and now you can puppet agent --agent_disabled_lockfile=/tmp/foo
2014-09-24 14:28:34	 *	nibalizer doesn't get whats the problem
2014-09-24 14:28:40	clarkb	nibalizer: ok so that is what that does? it was completely unclear
2014-09-24 14:28:50	clarkb	nibalizer: the problem is that there are several lockfile you pointed out
2014-09-24 14:28:53	nibalizer	what was unclear about 'agent_disabled_lockfile' ?
2014-09-24 14:28:56	clarkb	none of which are clear in what their purpose is
2014-09-24 14:29:07	clarkb	nibalizer: on its own its less confusing
2014-09-24 14:29:13	clarkb	but compared to agent_catalog_lockfile
2014-09-24 14:29:21	clarkb	I dunno if I need both, one or the other, etc
2014-09-24 14:29:41	clarkb	before you just had *the* lockfile
2014-09-24 14:29:43	clarkb	now you have many
2014-09-24 14:29:58	clarkb	will I get the correct catalog with these new options? I dunno
2014-09-24 14:30:14	clarkb	maybe my catalog is locked and it won't actually test the thing I asked it to
2014-09-24 14:30:26	bkero	Man, this is so complicated compared to openstack
2014-09-24 14:30:58	retrov	what's wront with service puppet stop; puppet agent -t?
2014-09-24 14:31:01	retrov	wrong*
2014-09-24 14:31:07	clarkb	retrov: we don't run puppet that way
2014-09-24 14:31:28	clarkb	its triggered via ansible so more similar to running puppet in a cron
2014-09-24 14:31:44	clarkb	bkero: oh don't get me started on openstack. we have the same rants with them too
2014-09-24 14:31:54	clarkb	bkero: see the various emails mordred has been vomitting
2014-09-24 14:32:18	retrov	clarkb: what's the puppet command you're running via ansible?
2014-09-24 14:32:27	clarkb	retrov: puppet agent --test
2014-09-24 14:35:24	clarkb	bkero: novaclient has an option to set a volume's fs type then attach the volume to your node so that you can do something like `nova boot --volume someuuid --fstype ext4 servername` except it completely ignore the fstype unless you are doing an ephemeral device for swap
2014-09-24 14:35:35	clarkb	bkero: it took me about a day to figure out why nova was not working at all
2014-09-24 14:35:50	clarkb	also that fstype value is stored arbitrarily in the databse
2014-09-24 14:35:54	clarkb	because why not
2014-09-24 14:36:01	bkero	Fuck it, enum 'em
2014-09-24 14:36:06	bkero	--fstype 1
2014-09-24 14:36:30	bkero	clarkb: That's...broken
2014-09-24 14:36:46	clarkb	ya
2014-09-24 14:36:55	clarkb	so we yelled and they said "oh ya we know"
2014-09-24 14:37:00	bkero	nova team should be ashamed
2014-09-24 14:37:02	clarkb	ok I guess I will move on with life
2014-09-24 14:37:13	nibalizer	clarkb: ya so the problem i think is that i pointed you to the 'reference' documentation 
2014-09-24 14:37:27	nibalizer	which is a terse document that is not user friendly and leads to exactly what you ran into
2014-09-24 14:37:38	nibalizer	which is a bit of ETOOMANYKNOBS
2014-09-24 14:37:53	nibalizer	and a bit of 'these are all the same... i feel like im taking crazy pills'
2014-09-24 14:38:11	nibalizer	agent_disabled_lock is the modern version of what we used to use as puppetdlockfile
2014-09-24 14:39:19	clarkb	on the bright side I learned a lot of about nova's api server debugging that :)
2014-09-24 14:39:36	clarkb	nibalizer: so the other thing taht confused the hell out of me was that grepping git log -p in puppet for puppetdlockfile didn';t really show ot going away
2014-09-24 14:39:47	clarkb	nibalizer: I am guessing ruby meta programming is at owrk and I should just give up
2014-09-24 14:40:02	nibalizer	clarkb: hahahha its still in the soruce?

2014-09-24 15:58:50	clarkb	its not super user friendly for sure
2014-09-24 16:10:51	bkero	clarkb: is that the same systemd?
2014-09-24 16:11:10	bkero	what's in /ssy/fs/cgroup/systemd/tasks?
2014-09-24 16:11:33	clarkb	bkero: a whole bunch of what looks like pids
2014-09-24 16:11:50	clarkb	bkero: I think upstart is pretending to be systemd when it comes to cgroups because cgroups and systemd are so closely tied together
2014-09-24 16:13:49	bkero	Are they?
2014-09-24 16:14:04	clarkb	bkero: iirc yes
2014-09-24 16:14:15	clarkb	bkero: at least for the management of things
2014-09-24 16:14:39	clarkb	I am digging in aptitude
2014-09-24 16:14:41	bkero	I would have expected systemd to only be a consumer of cgroups
2014-09-24 16:14:51	clarkb	bkero: it is the manager of them now too
2014-09-24 16:14:58	clarkb	they got rid of the old stuff to manage them iirc
2014-09-24 16:15:09	bkero	Err?
2014-09-24 16:15:15	clarkb	so I have systemd-shim installed
2014-09-24 16:15:26	lewisrjc	YESS
2014-09-24 16:15:26	clarkb	whcih emulated systemd for systemd services without having init be systemd
2014-09-24 16:15:28	lewisrjc	OKAY
2014-09-24 16:15:29	alevar	clarkb: I'm pretty sure that falls into "kinda sort not really"
2014-09-24 16:15:46	clarkb	I am guessing that those services expect the systemd cgroups to exist to work properly
2014-09-24 16:15:54	clarkb	so upstarts makes it a thing
2014-09-24 16:15:54	bkero	cgcreate/cgexec/cgclassify?
2014-09-24 16:16:02	alevar	Isn't it something like the need for a manager is there, and systemd is the only project that has implemented a cgroups manager?
2014-09-24 16:16:14	bkero	...lxc?
2014-09-24 16:16:15	clarkb	alevar: no there were services to manage it before
2014-09-24 16:16:26	lewisrjc	it's not
2014-09-24 16:16:31	lewisrjc	matlab just went weird for a while
2014-09-24 16:16:40	clarkb	bkero: the thing that moves processes into and out of groups is what systemd is supposed to replace
2014-09-24 16:16:46	clarkb	I forget what that daemon is called
2014-09-24 16:16:53	lewisrjc	I don't entirely understadn the nuances of some of the code does
2014-09-24 16:17:31	clarkb	and systemd services installs logind and dbus (localed, hostname, timedated) according to the package
2014-09-24 16:17:43	bkero	clarkb: I'm damn sure the kernel folks aren't going to let systemd into kernel land. That's why they're pushing so hard for kbus.
2014-09-24 16:17:54	clarkb	bkero: its not the kernel land
2014-09-24 16:18:08	clarkb	bkero: its the please go make sure processes are in the correct cgroups for me userland

2014-09-25 05:43:28	lewisrjc	...
2014-09-25 05:43:41	lewisrjc	bash vulnerability discovered
2014-09-25 05:43:59	lewisrjc	that doesn't work on cat boxes if their test is accurate
2014-09-25 05:44:16	lewisrjc	also doesn't seem to affect ksh so SUCK IT HATERS!
2014-09-25 05:44:58	lewisrjc	also anyone saying this is worse than heartbleed is hallucinating
2014-09-25 05:51:18	duchessa	heartbleed was only bad for servers anyway..
2014-09-25 05:51:27	duchessa	as long as end users update their information
2014-09-25 05:51:47	duchessa	also zsh >
2014-09-25 05:51:59	duchessa	but zsh is also vulnerable.. or so i was informed..
2014-09-25 05:52:47	lewisrjc	oh I se
2014-09-25 05:52:49	lewisrjc	see
2014-09-25 05:53:05	lewisrjc	the contention is there will be more unpatched servers, that's probable
2014-09-25 05:53:32	duchessa	but it's an easy patch that should be in all distros repos now
2014-09-25 05:53:40	duchessa	either that or your distro sucks
2014-09-25 05:53:52	duchessa	or its' debian and doesn't know about updates
2014-09-25 05:57:03	lewisrjc	well, most people don't just blindly patch, they have real chang control, but you need code execution before you can do anything, and there's no permission elevation
2014-09-25 05:57:26	duchessa	true..
2014-09-25 05:57:36	lewisrjc	so it's basically cgi as root (which o be fair most people do) that's the attack vectore
2014-09-25 05:57:51	lewisrjc	(and apparently dhcp maybe? I don't understand that)
2014-09-25 05:58:09	duchessa	cgi??
2014-09-25 05:58:11	duchessa	nice
2014-09-25 05:58:13	duchessa	more tlas
2014-09-25 05:58:19	duchessa	that i have no idea what they mean..
2014-09-25 05:58:37	lewisrjc	a defense in depth hous will not be compromised by this, or at least shouldn't be from what I understand
2014-09-25 05:59:00	lewisrjc	if someone wants to correct me have at it, but that's how I read this
2014-09-25 05:59:08	duchessa	meh i don't know much
2014-09-25 05:59:26	lewisrjc	cgi is common gateway interface, it's an archaic interface primarily used to create dynamic webpages
2014-09-25 05:59:33	duchessa	oh
2014-09-25 05:59:35	duchessa	ok
2014-09-25 05:59:37	lewisrjc	it's basically completely deprecated
2014-09-25 05:59:49	lewisrjc	although the replacement may be vulnerable as well
2014-09-25 06:00:08	duchessa	hmm
2014-09-25 06:00:32	lewisrjc	like, if apache is allowed to execute code, that's an attack vector, if you don't sandbox or protect against that, you are vulnerable to all sorts of stuff
2014-09-25 06:00:50	duchessa	yea well at that point..
2014-09-25 06:01:26	duchessa	not limiting what something like apache can do is not the greatest idea
2014-09-25 06:01:41	lewisrjc	this is not the first time it's been an attack vector, it likely won't be the last
2014-09-25 06:02:03	lewisrjc	actually I don't know if that's primarily what CGI was used for, it's what it was famous for
2014-09-25 06:02:14	duchessa	hmm
2014-09-25 06:02:59	lewisrjc	there are also problems with the way some apache servers run that all the processes are run as a single user (certain groups have gotten into trouble with that)
2014-09-25 06:03:25	duchessa	oh.. shit
2014-09-25 06:03:31	duchessa	it's 6

2014-09-25 12:38:37	nightfly	ssh accepts some lang/locale related ones by default in at least ubuntu
2014-09-25 12:39:00	alevar	Are those passed through SSH?
2014-09-25 12:39:07	nightfly	yes
2014-09-25 12:40:24	alevar	yuck
2014-09-25 12:41:34	alevar	That sounds like a fundamentally terrible idea...
2014-09-25 12:41:59	clarkb	alevar: its a user experience thing
2014-09-25 12:42:14	clarkb	its nice when you don't english

2014-09-25 14:06:00	alevar	It sounds like Django's response to at least one attempt at using shellshock is best summarized as "lol wat, gtfo"
2014-09-25 14:07:15	MaddHatter	alevar: they clearly are satisfied with it; I am not, and see their approach as risky and/or lazy
2014-09-25 14:07:22	clarkb	is it really an issue? keyauth only and you're fine
2014-09-25 14:08:50	MaddHatter	clarkb: good passwords and you're fine, too. But there's still no reason expose a service like that
2014-09-25 14:09:22	clarkb	I dont I require key auth
2014-09-25 14:11:44	MaddHatter	defense in depth, etc. One mitigation does not mean another should be ignored. If a problem with keys is discovered today and announced two weeks from now, you've unnecessarily exposed yourself to risk during the interrim.
2014-09-25 14:12:22	MaddHatter	maybe debian decided to initialize all their variables or somtehing
2014-09-25 14:12:43	clarkb	exponential backoff doesnt help that at all
2014-09-25 14:12:52	clarkb	it only helps brute forcing
2014-09-25 14:13:10	MaddHatter	it does, because it helps brute forcing... what?
2014-09-25 14:13:56	clarkb	if my key is owned (however that can happen) exponential backoff does nothing
2014-09-25 14:14:27	clarkb	if my password is short and I am brute forced the backoff would have mitigated that attack
2014-09-25 14:14:46	MaddHatter	sure, that's a different threat with different mitigations. But "X is also a problem" is not an answer to "let's not mitigate Y"
2014-09-25 14:15:27	clarkb	I have mitigated it. no password logins allowed...
2014-09-25 14:15:30	MaddHatter	(other than in the much larger picture of finite resources)
2014-09-25 14:16:01	MaddHatter	you have adopted one mitigation. That doesn't mean all other potential mitigations are irrelevant or should be ignored.
2014-09-25 14:16:16	nibalizer	i feel like im doing it wrong
2014-09-25 14:16:25	nibalizer	im trying to make my laptop do the shellshock thing and it wont
2014-09-25 14:16:29	nibalizer	ist bash is old enough
2014-09-25 14:16:37	MaddHatter	nibalizer: linux?
2014-09-25 14:16:44	nibalizer	ya, trusty
2014-09-25 14:16:55	nightfly	what doesn env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test" output?
2014-09-25 14:17:04	nightfly	s/doesn/does/
2014-09-25 14:17:13	nibalizer	like in apt-cache policy there is a new bash from security.ubuntu and i dont have it installed
2014-09-25 14:17:41	nibalizer	oh that works
2014-09-25 14:18:04	nibalizer	this one didnt tho: env X="() { :;} ; echo busted" /bin/sh -c "echo stuff"
2014-09-25 14:18:20	nightfly	works for me
2014-09-25 14:18:35	MaddHatter	those are the same, unless your shell is doing something funny with "" vs ''
2014-09-25 14:18:40	 *	nightfly has an unpatched laptop >.<
2014-09-25 14:19:09	 *	nightfly now has a patched laptop :)
2014-09-25 14:19:13	bajr	what is the output supposed to be if it's unsecured? or is it not supposed to output at all?
2014-09-25 14:19:24	MaddHatter	bajr: if it says vulnerable, you're vulnerable
2014-09-25 14:19:29	MaddHatter	if it only says "this is a test", you're not
2014-09-25 14:20:45	 *	bajr nods
2014-09-25 14:20:46	MaddHatter	on my work desktop, it looks like sh is also vulnerable
2014-09-25 14:21:01	 *	nightfly needs to find a test for the new variant of the attack
2014-09-25 14:21:36	MaddHatter	the real problem is "oh, that looks like a function. let's eval it!"
2014-09-25 14:22:20	bajr	my bash-fu isn't up to snuff so i'm not sure what the test command is doing, exactly
2014-09-25 14:22:25	 *	bajr googles.
2014-09-25 14:22:27	clarkb	is your sh really bash?
2014-09-25 14:22:39	MaddHatter	it defines an environment variable that looks to bash like a function
2014-09-25 14:23:05	MaddHatter	bash looks at environment variables, and if they look like functions, it evals them... including any extraneous extra code trailing after the function definition
2014-09-25 14:23:19	clarkb	git had a bug like this one too in its tab completion
2014-09-25 14:23:32	clarkb	I dont think it was formally disclosed
2014-09-25 14:23:32	MaddHatter	so by putting <function><code> into an environment variable, you can make bash execute <code>
2014-09-25 14:23:44	bajr	interesting
2014-09-25 14:24:17	MaddHatter	well, you can make gnu's bash execute <code>. I haven't found any other bash implementations that were dumb enough to just eval stuff at random.
2014-09-25 14:25:44	clarkb	isnt bash a gnu project?
2014-09-25 14:26:03	clarkb	there are other implementations?
2014-09-25 14:26:14	MaddHatter	I don't know. The only machines I can make execute code are linux, though. Nothing else fails that test.
2014-09-25 14:26:29	alevar	MaddHatter: Mac?
2014-09-25 14:26:43	MaddHatter	alevar: I don't have a mac to test with
2014-09-25 14:26:43	alevar	Or is that not its default shell?
2014-09-25 14:26:54	alevar	Calling all Mac users!!!
2014-09-25 14:27:04	tschuy	alevar: Bash is the default shell on OS X, and is vulnerable
2014-09-25 14:27:12	alevar	tschuy++
2014-09-25 14:27:21	tschuy	and you can't just apt-get or yum to fix it, you have to wait for apple
2014-09-25 14:28:29	clarkb	you can install not OSX >_>
2014-09-25 14:29:22	tschuy	If I had a machine that ran OS X, I'd leave it running OS X... that's a beautiful operating system to use.
2014-09-25 14:29:40	tschuy	otoh I'm stuck with windows boxes for now, so they're all linux boxes now :P
2014-09-25 14:29:51	 *	dondon installed windows on his mac, and didn't go back
2014-09-25 14:30:27	clarkb	tschuy except for the patch vulnerability aspect apparently
2014-09-25 14:30:51	MaddHatter	clarkb: well it's Apple. They're still learning to security.
2014-09-25 14:30:58	tschuy	clarkb: goto fail;

2014-09-25 14:31:33	MaddHatter	we still have some XP machines around. I cringe every time I have to use them.
2014-09-25 14:31:37	alevar	As long as you don't open a ton of browser windows, it's quite usable.
2014-09-25 14:31:57	alevar	1 GB of RAM, no problemo
2014-09-25 14:32:08	MaddHatter	(and afaict, there aren't plans afoot to upgrade/replace them, which is even more worrying)
2014-09-25 14:32:50	retrov	what's scary to me is embedded stuff
2014-09-25 14:32:55	dondon	MaddHatter: I broke the win 2k box at work cleaning up a virus, otherwise we'd e using it
2014-09-25 14:33:01	retrov	like with heartbleed, the chances of those things getting patched is really low
2014-09-25 14:33:05	dondon	retrov: that++ exactly
2014-09-25 14:34:31	clarkb	unknown label 'fail'
2014-09-25 14:36:06	MaddHatter	dondon: why can't they upgrade?
2014-09-25 14:36:36	dondon	upgrade? but it works just fine
2014-09-25 14:36:49	dondon	^ their reasoning
2014-09-25 14:36:59	clarkb	windows 3.1 and 95 is common in fabs apparently
2014-09-25 14:37:51	MaddHatter	clarkb: it's not quite that bad at any fabs I know, but they do tend to run outdated software. Intel relies on a bunch of redhat 6 (no, not that redhat 6... the one before it)
2014-09-25 14:38:37	retrov	!RHEL ?
2014-09-25 14:38:38	dondon	pretty much everything Intel uses in fabs are the version of QNX they came with
2014-09-25 14:38:43	MaddHatter	retrov: correct
2014-09-25 14:38:44	retrov	yikes
2014-09-25 14:39:15	MaddHatter	it drives expensive equipment, and the vendor wouldn't port it forward past the 2.4 kernel
2014-09-25 14:39:20	dondon	i'll be deploying rhel 6.3 appliances for the next 6mo before the new version comes out
2014-09-25 14:42:22	clarkb	new version is out :P
2014-09-25 14:42:26	clarkb	7 is here
2014-09-25 14:42:53	MaddHatter	I keep bugging people when we get to start using 7, and they usually just sigh or give some dismissive shrug :-(
2014-09-25 14:43:36	lewisrjc	out of curiosity, if it works, why upgrade?
2014-09-25 14:43:48	lewisrjc	particularly for non-networked boxes?
2014-09-25 14:43:54	MaddHatter	although because of bugs, we might get forced to qt5 and boost 1.56, which would be a wierd combination with (the officially-supported) rhel5
2014-09-25 14:44:26	clarkb	lewisrjc: your ability to support old stuff bit rots
2014-09-25 14:44:33	clarkb	people quit/retire
2014-09-25 14:44:40	clarkb	toolchains disappear
2014-09-25 14:44:44	lewisrjc	um
2014-09-25 14:44:46	lewisrjc	kay
2014-09-25 14:44:49	lewisrjc	if it works
2014-09-25 14:44:52	MaddHatter	lewisrjc: that's all fine and good as long as it continues to receive security updates. Being non-networked helps a lot, but still is not protection from vulnerabilities.
2014-09-25 14:44:52	lewisrjc	why fix it?
2014-09-25 14:45:08	clarkb	because of the human element
2014-09-25 14:45:17	clarkb	all software has bugs
2014-09-25 14:45:21	clarkb	it will break
2014-09-25 14:45:34	clarkb	you want that to be something you can handle
2014-09-25 14:45:40	lewisrjc	MaddHatter: If you aren't networked, what vulnerability vector are you worried about?
2014-09-25 14:46:21	MaddHatter	lewisrjc: any kind of information transfer. Thumb drives, other peripherals, floppy disks, etc.
2014-09-25 14:46:47	lewisrjc	interesting
2014-09-25 14:47:22	MaddHatter	the thumb drives thing was the downfall of Iran's nuclear program, you might remember. They were smart enough not to network it, but people still had to copy stuff back and forth, and so thumb drives became the method of compromise.
2014-09-25 14:48:06	MaddHatter	and even without APT, opportunistic malware will still spread, and once it finds a repository on an unpatched system, it will continue to spread outward from there indefinitely
2014-09-25 14:50:31	clarkb	there was a poc for transmitting malware over air gaps with sound iirc
2014-09-25 14:50:54	MaddHatter	the bios one? that got shot down as a hoax, didn't it?
2014-09-25 14:51:19	clarkb	MaddHatter: oh did it? thats too bad because it was cool
2014-09-25 14:51:32	stormcrow	I heard about a couple: one that was a hoax, and one that wasn't (but was amazingly impractical)
2014-09-25 14:51:40	retrov	lewisrjc: stuxnet was spread via USB drives
2014-09-25 14:52:06	retrov	the computers in Iran's Natanz facility were air-gapped, but someone brought in flash drives and that's how stuxnet got in
2014-09-25 14:52:23	MaddHatter	intelligence agencies will implant physical equipment to provide covert connectivity when not otherwise available, but I assume that's not the sort of threat you're trying to mitigate
2014-09-25 14:52:57	retrov	MaddHatter: stuxnet spread around via the internet first, IIRC. that's how it got onto flash drives initially
2014-09-25 14:53:27	MaddHatter	retrov: the timeline I've seen suggests it was targeted specifically to Iran, and only hit the internet (and then was discovered) after it leaked outside its intended target area
2014-09-25 14:54:11	MaddHatter	which makes sense... if someone plugs in a thumb drive in one place (at the reactor), they'll probably also plug it in somewhere else (at home)
2014-09-25 15:05:20	alevar	Someone on Le Reddit was insisting that starting in the 90's, law enforcement had devices available that could read a hard drive from across a street, assuming that it's not spinning. That's impossible, no?
2014-09-25 15:06:11	alevar	It seems like the magnetic fields would be too weak and clustered.
2014-09-25 15:06:45	lewisrjc	alevar: yes, there have been several such claims, it makes very little sense
2014-09-25 15:07:09	lewisrjc	I mean, maybe in a faraday cage under experimental conditions
2014-09-25 15:07:52	lewisrjc	although usually those "proofs of concepts," were purely theoretical (there was another one for reading the instructions off a computer use radios)
2014-09-25 15:08:34	nightfly	I <3 the idea of reading things like keyboard/disk data via indicator LEDs though
2014-09-25 15:14:46	MaddHatter	if it were possible to read a hard drive platter from across the street, then we'd have had laptop-sized 10PB hard drives 10 years ago
2014-09-25 15:15:41	bkero	nightfly: It's possible to read PS/2 input from AC ripple on the PSU
2014-09-25 15:16:03	bkero	Likewise it's possible to read keystrokes on laptops from the reflection of lasers aimed at a laptop screen
2014-09-25 15:16:19	MaddHatter	or the sound of the key presses

2014-09-25 16:01:35	nightfly	why? They seem kinda willing to adopt new technologies
2014-09-25 16:01:49	nightfly	would have a better change if you were on dev team
2014-09-25 16:02:57	clarkb	suggestions for new technology backed by more than "its super duper cool" should always be encouraged
2014-09-25 16:03:20	clarkb	I stayed up way too late last night reading up on mesos. its super cool but I don't think it would be useful for us so not suggestion we cram it in
2014-09-25 16:03:37	clarkb	that said mesos jobs as a service instead of old school LRPs would be a cool thing for the cat
2014-09-25 16:06:32	alevar	nightfly, clarkb: From what I can tell, Devops is more willing to experiment with new technology.
2014-09-25 16:06:44	alevar	Dev varies widely.
2014-09-25 16:06:53	alevar	nibalizer: Fair?

2014-09-25 17:35:30	duchessa	intel does not follow labor laws and idk about apple
2014-09-25 17:35:38	duchessa	haven't heard anything bad about them yet
2014-09-25 17:35:52	clarkb	duchessa: in this case C level employees of said companies conspired to not hire each others engineers
2014-09-25 17:36:18	clarkb	the emails between jobs and was it sergey? are pretty damning
2014-09-25 17:36:58	duchessa	so it's kind of like FLIR but instead of firing your employees you just don't hire them
2014-09-25 17:37:19	 *	Fyrexus pokes
2014-09-25 17:37:26	Corbin	Fyrexus: Oh hi.
2014-09-25 17:37:27	clarkb	duchessa: firing would be ok
2014-09-25 17:37:36	clarkb	duchessa: the issue here is apple and google all agreed to not poach
2014-09-25 17:37:41	clarkb	duchessa: whcih depressed salaries

2014-09-25 17:37:50	Fyrexus	snap crackle pop rice crispies!
2014-09-25 17:37:53	clarkb	firing/letting go would almost be preferred
2014-09-25 17:37:55	duchessa	i mean FLIR is going down the shitter anyway
2014-09-25 17:37:58	clarkb	because then you could go get a new salary

2014-09-28 22:46:57	askore	hehe, the fact that its difficult is telling. some people would say "internet explorer & microsoft office" and be done

2014-09-28 22:49:23	duchessa	good point

2014-09-29 00:11:56	duchessa	so i've always wondered something about windows antivirus companies
2014-09-29 00:12:07	duchessa	they create "installers" which are actually more like a downloader
2014-09-29 00:12:09	duchessa	so..
2014-09-29 00:12:26	duchessa	you have to connect to the internet before you're secure to become secure
2014-09-29 00:12:33	duchessa	so you were unsecure at some point
2014-09-29 00:12:44	duchessa	therefore the seucrity is not neccessarily working
2014-09-29 00:13:00	duchessa	maybe i'm crazy but i think there is an issue here
2014-09-29 00:39:57	Epitrope	you mean there might be a flaw in the architecture of windows antivirus software? http://i.imgur.com/nBc28Vv.gif
2014-09-29 00:41:09	duchessa	lol
2014-09-29 00:41:23	duchessa	can't really load the gif though.. internet sucks..
2014-09-29 00:42:02	duchessa	i mean i know there are many problems with the concept and design of of it but i just think that their logic in getting their product to their customers is so bad it's pointless

2014-09-29 09:03:09	lewisrjc	/w/win 16
2014-09-29 09:03:48	lewisrjc	for what it's worth I haven't had much in the way of problems with virii on windows affecting my every day life (beyond the obvious)
2014-09-29 09:18:08	tamgc	in general, for Windows, AV is meant as a preventive measure, although it ends up being a reactive thing anyways, due to the nature of virus definitions/signatures
2014-09-29 09:18:39	tamgc	it's mainly preventive of known threats and/or uses heuristics to try to predict new ones
2014-09-29 09:19:14	tamgc	if you're suspecting you've been hit with a virus already...you can't really rely on the software that's on the system at that point
2014-09-29 09:19:24	tamgc	so best to just yank the drive and stick it in a known good one to scan
2014-09-29 09:19:43	tamgc	or boot to CD/scan sort of deal
2014-09-29 09:20:41	tamgc	also, by default, since Windows XP SP2 days, the system's firewall's enabled by default...

2014-09-29 09:28:07	tamgc	(oh and if you're behind a home router, chances are you're NAT'd anyways, and don't have port fowarding to exploitable things...)
2014-09-29 10:00:18	duchessa	system firewall??
2014-09-29 10:00:36	duchessa	that thing is a joke
2014-09-29 10:01:05	duchessa	but you make a valid point
2014-09-29 10:03:15	tamgc	eh, if it blocks connections?
2014-09-29 10:03:49	duchessa	well i'm more paranoid than most.. so maybe i should get not worry about it. but first i need to fine a USB 2.0 USB or my install DvD >.> so it maybe a moot point
2014-09-29 10:04:18	clarkb	if paranoid install one of [openbsd]
2014-09-29 10:04:36	tamgc	eh, if paranoid, stay offline -.-

2014-09-29 10:05:33	duchessa	also i run linux by default but it may be handy to have access to a limited set of Microsoft tools since outside of CS it is generally required..
2014-09-29 10:05:42	clarkb	as often as I think that might be a good thing to do I enjoy working with computers that talk to each other too much
2014-09-29 10:05:51	tamgc	also, if you use a USB and copy off another system, how do you know *that* system or the image/binaries that you download aren't compromised?
2014-09-29 10:05:54	duchessa	:3
2014-09-29 10:05:56	clarkb	duchessa it is?
2014-09-29 10:06:39	duchessa	it depends on the class but some professors expect you to have certain tools. i've found business classes to be particularly bad. however i am not a business student anymore..
2014-09-29 10:07:21	duchessa	also tamgc idk.. i suppose i could read my kernel and use gentoo.. but i was looking for more of a Windows makes me nervous and how do i deal with thar kind of solution
2014-09-29 10:09:18	duchessa	also spelling..
2014-09-29 10:10:41	tamgc	but then how do you know your firmware/baked on instructions aren't compromised? =)

2014-09-29 13:41:31	bkero	dash seems to be similar enough to be vulnerable

2014-09-29 13:43:27	clarkb	bkero I though dash wasnt vulnerable
2014-09-29 13:43:38	clarkb	jesusaurus right but with bash?
2014-09-29 13:44:03	bkero	Ahh, so dash isn't vulnerable.

2014-09-29 13:55:16	clarkb	jesusaurus ok so they explicitly bash there? anyways the point I was trying to make is you must bash. dhcp shelling out should dash. oh well
2014-09-29 13:55:37	jesusaurus	oh, yeah
2014-09-29 13:56:24	lewisrjc	KORNSHElL FOR LIFE! also is there a vulnerability in Apache other than the CGI compromise? I feel like defense in depth would mitigate this problem massively
2014-09-29 13:56:25	jesusaurus	its not that uncommon to explicitly bash to use bashisms
2014-09-29 13:56:48	jesusaurus	but maybe now people will use zshisms instead of bashisms...

2014-09-29 13:58:43	clarkb	pilgrimd apparently not if you dhcpcd
2014-09-29 13:59:55	jesusaurus	that hn link suggests that its dhclient that always uses bash, but i cant recall the difference at the moment between the two
2014-09-29 14:00:11	pilgrimd	clarkb: That only applies if the system shell is bash. ISC-DHCPD doesn't require bash.
2014-09-29 14:00:30	clarkb	pilgrimd that is what I thought
2014-09-29 14:00:36	clarkb	bkero says I am wrong
2014-09-29 14:01:24	pilgrimd	bkero: You're wrong. The reason dhcpd params are an attack vector is due to Linux systems using bash as the compiled-in default Bourne shell.
2014-09-29 14:01:50	pilgrimd	On FreeBSD, ISC-DHCP client and server use /bin/sh, which is a non-vuln Bourne shell.
2014-09-29 14:02:23	jesusaurus	pilgrimd: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8370374
2014-09-29 14:02:30	bkero	pilgrimd: I can't find any evidence of the ISC-DHCP client being vuln, although dhcpcd seems to be.
2014-09-29 14:02:56	pilgrimd	bkero: Any DHCP server or client that uses hook scripts can be vulnerable if they invoke bash.
2014-09-29 14:03:18	bkero	pilgrimd: Okay. Do you happen to know which distros use hook scripts?
2014-09-29 14:04:03	pilgrimd	bkero: No, but almost any non-trivial set up (like those used by default in a lot of Linux distros) have hook scripts to trigger the rest of network config subsystem.
2014-09-29 14:04:26	bkero	THat would lead me to believe that quite a few would be vulnerable.
2014-09-29 14:05:09	pilgrimd	I have them on routers for dhcpv6 to do things like -HUP rtadvd or poke DNS updates.
2014-09-29 14:06:22	clarkb	I would expect debuntu to be fine because dash
2014-09-29 14:07:54	bkero	I think ubuntu systems still have bash, but use dash for the user's default shell
2014-09-29 14:08:19	clarkb	no
2014-09-29 14:08:25	clarkb	bash is user default
2014-09-29 14:08:29	clarkb	system is dash
2014-09-29 14:09:32	bkero	Unless there's a nice big #!/bin/bash on top of those dhcp-scripts
2014-09-29 14:09:33	pilgrimd	I'm actually having a hard time groking how DHCP would even work as a vector. ISC's client doesn't pass any variables that can hold arbitrary strings (it's all addresses, interfaces, and FQDNs).
2014-09-29 14:10:32	bkero	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8370374 seems to show that debian/ubuntu are targets

2014-09-30 15:49:11	uberj	okay
2014-09-30 15:49:36	uberj	also, do you guys './unstack.sh; ./clean.sh' or do you just do one of those? or in reverse order?
2014-09-30 15:49:49	clarkb	uberj: no we nova delete && nova boot
2014-09-30 15:49:53	clarkb	then rerun devstack
2014-09-30 15:49:54	uberj	heh
2014-09-30 15:50:30	ryan	does anybody know the difference between a channel and a list in redis?
2014-09-30 15:50:35	jesusaurus	i think grenade runs ./unstack.sh

2014-09-30 15:53:16	clarkb	uberj: keep in mind unstack doesn't touch non openstack services
2014-09-30 15:53:31	clarkb	uberj: so if you are going from newer than icehouse to icehouse your db stuff may explode
2014-09-30 15:54:45	uberj	clarkb: I'm just restacking like you suggested
2014-09-30 16:03:15	clarkb	uberj: you should check out our upstream dib image building stuff that is finally happening
2014-09-30 16:03:21	clarkb	except it is broken right now :(
2014-09-30 16:03:39	clarkb	long story short with a single commands and ltos of bandwidth you get a disk image that is identical to our build hosts
2014-09-30 16:04:35	clarkb	uberj: if you grab https://review.openstack.org/#/c/124254 and run the build-image.sh script as a user with sudo (I wish dib didn't need that but oh well) then you get a ~3gb trusty image identical to what we test on

2014-09-30 16:13:01	clarkb	uberj: ya, git review -d 124254, or just grab the git fetch and checkout command on that patchset in gerrit
2014-09-30 16:13:19	clarkb	there is a copy pastable string in the gerrit page
2014-09-30 16:15:29	uberj	ah man, it wants my gerit username and stuff... i don't remember that shit
2014-09-30 16:15:47	uberj	oh, my browser does though
2014-09-30 16:15:49	uberj	nice
2014-09-30 16:15:52	clarkb	uberj: you don't need it, just pick the anonymous thing
2014-09-30 16:16:01	clarkb	git review -d needs creds right now because its all ssh based
2014-09-30 16:16:11	clarkb	we are working on making read only ops anonymous with that tool though
2014-09-30 16:18:12	uberj	k, dib is doing its thing
2014-09-30 16:19:02	clarkb	uberj: on a cold cache it should take about half an hour
2014-09-30 16:19:07	clarkb	warm cache is about half that
2014-09-30 16:19:32	uberj	clarkb: so what exactly is this image going to do for me? is it just going to be a working install of openstack all-in-one?
2014-09-30 16:19:51	clarkb	uberj: not quite. instead it will have all the things that devstack needs precached on it
2014-09-30 16:20:05	clarkb	uberj: it makes rerunning devstack in the delete, boot fashion much quicker
2014-09-30 16:20:19	clarkb	all the git repos are caches and teh cirros images and other vm images are cached
2014-09-30 16:20:27	uberj	I see

2014-09-30 16:26:51	clarkb	we should be using the same version of subprocess bceause that is all in a chroot mounted off of the ubuntu image for trusty

2014-09-30 16:27:00	clarkb	uberj: I would use latest

2014-09-30 16:28:07	uberj	diskimage-builder==0.0.1.dev27.g32aa9da
2014-09-30 16:28:10	uberj	is what is installed
2014-09-30 16:28:39	uberj	wow, I think thats old
2014-09-30 16:28:44	clarkb	diskimage-builder==0.1.18 is what I am using
2014-09-30 16:28:51	uberj	moved to diskimage-builder==0.1.31
2014-09-30 16:28:52	clarkb	so ya looks ancient

2014-09-30 16:31:46	uberj	what version of python?
2014-09-30 16:31:50	uberj	do I need?
2014-09-30 16:32:16	clarkb	27
2014-09-30 16:32:23	uberj	ah
2014-09-30 16:32:24	uberj	yeah
2014-09-30 16:32:26	uberj	26
2014-09-30 16:32:35	clarkb	26 needs to diaf already
2014-09-30 16:32:39	uberj	well
2014-09-30 16:32:40	uberj	see
2014-09-30 16:32:50	uberj	at mozilla we can't do that because rhel
2014-09-30 16:32:56	uberj	and upgardes are hard apparently
2014-09-30 16:32:59	clarkb	right it is all rhels fault
2014-09-30 16:33:01	uberj	yeah
2014-09-30 16:33:03	clarkb	I blame them completely
2014-09-30 16:33:13	clarkb	also I hate that they backport random shit
2014-09-30 16:33:17	clarkb	so its like 2.6+
2014-09-30 16:33:27	clarkb	then people wonder why our stuff only works on rhel 26
2014-09-30 16:33:32	clarkb	well because rhel 26 is special
2014-09-30 16:33:38	clarkb	and we didn't discover that until it was too late
2014-09-30 16:34:25	uberj	hmm
2014-09-30 16:34:36	uberj	need to boot a non rhel machine then
2014-09-30 16:34:43	uberj	or rhel7 at least
2014-09-30 16:35:01	uberj	to the cloud!
2014-09-30 16:35:18	nibalizer	stop using rhel?
2014-09-30 16:35:32	clarkb	there are py33 bits in rhel 26
2014-09-30 16:35:55	clarkb	what could possibly go wrong
2014-09-30 16:36:12	uberj	nibalizer: omg, why haven't we thought of that before!??!?!
2014-09-30 16:36:48	nibalizer	uberj: that will be $10,000 in consulting fees

2014-09-30 16:38:13	clarkb	seriously though 26 is dead
2014-09-30 16:38:19	clarkb	and redhat has ruined their version
2014-09-30 16:38:28	clarkb	I have no idea why debian insists on keeping it around
2014-09-30 16:41:19	uberj	because people have apps that use it
2014-09-30 16:41:40	clarkb	but its not supported
2014-09-30 16:41:46	clarkb	and I would not trust debian for support
2014-09-30 16:42:52	uberj	it doesn't matter about support. somewhere someone has an app that they don't understand doing a critical job for their business and it runs python2.6 and no one knows how to port it
2014-09-30 16:43:19	uberj	clarkb: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/6674771 looks like you leaked a dep
2014-09-30 16:43:51	clarkb	oh yup there is a patch for that somewhere
2014-09-30 16:44:09	clarkb	uberj: you want python-yaml on debuntu or pyyaml from pypi iirc
2014-09-30 16:44:18	uberj	I did pyaml
2014-09-30 16:44:26	uberj	yeah
2014-09-30 16:44:28	uberj	okay
2014-09-30 16:45:04	clarkb	we use pyyaml everywhere so it is easy for us to forget to add that to the deps list
2014-09-30 16:45:15	clarkb	seriously pyyaml should just be in python stdlib already <_<
2014-09-30 16:45:34	uberj	they made that mistake with json and simplejson
2014-09-30 16:45:52	uberj	.-~never forget~-.
2014-09-30 16:46:31	clarkb	what is wrong with json?
2014-09-30 16:46:50	clarkb	I get really mad when people use lxml instaed of the xml module too
2014-09-30 16:46:54	clarkb	that C dependency
2014-09-30 16:47:43	jesusaurus	being afraid of upgrading is how you get critical services in cobol

2014-09-30 19:35:46	clarkb	anyone have a suggestion for non sucky desktop wireless card?
2014-09-30 19:35:48	nibalizer	it can do almost everything interesting except openstack
2014-09-30 19:35:56	nibalizer	and opesntack stuff is in development
2014-09-30 19:35:57	clarkb	nibalizer: when they announced wasn't there no code? oh maybe that is what I am thinking of
2014-09-30 19:35:58	nibalizer	im playing with it now
2014-09-30 19:36:04	clarkb	it had no code to do what I was interested in
2014-09-30 19:36:15	clarkb	I should just set up my bridge ap thing again
2014-09-30 19:36:26	nibalizer	yea it had no openstack code when it launched
2014-09-30 19:45:55	duchessa	glorious orings
2014-09-30 20:48:45	clarkb	ok now I am on an ap bridge, this is so much better

2014-10-01 12:40:30	Krampus	"10% of UO students have been raped."  That's a hell of a headline.
2014-10-01 13:01:53	zacharyp	note: make sure daughter does not go to UO
2014-10-01 13:02:27	Sunshine	That's lower than the national average.
2014-10-01 13:02:34	clarkb	zacharyp: was the study only at UO? a larger study would probably be even scarier
2014-10-01 13:03:01	Krampus	"Look to your left.  Look to your right.  Statistically, all of you will be sexually assaulted before this presentation has finished."
2014-10-01 13:03:34	Sunshine	You joke but one in six women is the national average.
2014-10-01 13:03:39	Krampus	clarkb: they link to the summary presentation.  Even with the limitations and likely self-selection (or lack thereof) of respondants, it's a lot of people.
2014-10-01 13:04:22	Sunshine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#United_States
2014-10-01 13:04:22	Krampus	Sunshine: I joke but not because I don't recognize it as a problem.
2014-10-01 13:04:23	link-bot	Rape statistics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (http://goo.gl/dXz0J)
2014-10-01 13:04:32	Sunshine	Enjoy some super sad stats
2014-10-01 13:04:38	Sunshine	MURICA
2014-10-01 13:04:40	clarkb	Sunshine: I think I read that this particular study used a narrow definition for rape as well which may explain the distance from average?
2014-10-01 13:04:44	Krampus	Sunshine: have you heard of this "yes mean yes" law that just passed in CA?
2014-10-01 13:05:03	Sunshine	Yep.
2014-10-01 13:05:16	Krampus	Sunshine: what's your take on it?
2014-10-01 13:05:55	Sunshine	I think it's a huge damn step in the right direction
2014-10-01 13:06:38	Sunshine	But that nonverbal consent should be ruled out.
2014-10-01 13:08:37	Krampus	Sunshine: From my admitted "top couple results on google" research I did when I hear the term, I'm not totally sure what the point is.  What does it provide over the normal sexual assault laws?
2014-10-01 13:10:17	Krampus	Sunshine: as far as elminating non-verbal, there are lots of ways to say yes without speaking it.  Although if it's not a consenual act to begin with, I don't see what a verbal statement will do.
2014-10-01 13:10:53	Krampus	Sunshine: my thought on it is a "you can't legislate stuff like this away.  You have to prevent people from thinking it's a good idea to sexually assault someone in the first place."
2014-10-01 13:13:34	Sunshine	I super do not want explain rape laws, rape culture, and campuses. Just know that it's super fucking prevalent, and there's plenty of stuff online to read that can explain better and more patiently than I would.
2014-10-01 13:15:29	wookiee	^I wish reddit would do this more often
2014-10-01 13:15:30	Krampus	Sunshine: I'm not saying there's not a large number of women assaulted daily nor that it isn't prevalent on campuses, nor any of the other "well, what did *you* do" sort of things.  I'm asking "how will this prevent future assaults?"
2014-10-01 13:17:24	Krampus	Sunshine: Educating people from a young age about right and wrong so they don't grow up to be bad people would be a more useful exercise.
2014-10-01 13:17:30	Sunshine	Krampus: I am explicitly telling you that I have zero interest or motivation in educating you, and that you are capable of finding better sources. And also, that you may want to ask yourself why you would think it was even a remotely good idea to keep chasing this up after my last response, and maybe even think about why I don't want to have to fucking defend rape laws. 
2014-10-01 13:20:10	Krampus	Sunshine: As you wish.  I apologize for discussing something that upsets you.
2014-10-01 13:22:23	Krampus	Sunshine: however without going deeper into it, since it obviously upsets you, misrepresenting my argument that I am taking an opposite, morally undefendable position is not productive.
2014-10-01 13:42:23	tamgc	Krampus: I don't see any misrepresentation of arguments, just directing you to do independent research, at which point pursuing a discussion/debate is not productive.
2014-10-01 13:48:47	greh	another dumb mac question
2014-10-01 13:49:10	greh	anyone know the keyboard shortcut to move around to different tabs in one application?
2014-10-01 13:49:29	tamgc	ctrl+tab for Windows, not sure about Macs
2014-10-01 13:49:52	wookiee	which application?
2014-10-01 13:50:17	greh	is there not a universal one for all of them?
2014-10-01 13:50:24	greh	specifically for terminal
2014-10-01 13:50:55	wookiee	shift-cmd-[arrow key]
2014-10-01 13:51:01	Krampus	tamgc: implicitly stating that i'm looking to undermine existing protections by continuing a line of questioning is a pretty big misrepresentation of my point of view.  To move to a less hotbutton variation, I'd have the same confusion of a law passed that enumerated all the different ways you aren't allowed to murder someone.  It's already covered by the base law so how does it further protect people?
2014-10-01 13:51:44	tamgc	Krampus: Good question, you should ask a lawyer.
2014-10-01 13:53:01	Krampus	wookiee: isn't it <clover>-left/right?
2014-10-01 13:53:17	wookiee	I do not own a mac, I simply googled it
2014-10-01 13:53:42	greh	yeah neither of those seem to work for terminal
2014-10-01 13:53:47	greh	I'm starting to think there might not be one
2014-10-01 13:53:48	Krampus	wookiee: more than i did.  I shut my eyes and pretended i was fighting with my SIL's laptop again. :P
2014-10-01 13:53:49	wookiee	*shrug*
2014-10-01 13:54:19	wookiee	SIL?
2014-10-01 13:54:29	Krampus	sister-in-law.
2014-10-01 13:54:34	wookiee	ah
2014-10-01 13:54:53	Krampus	she's got a ghetto mac that i was able to repair / upgrade to a slightly less shitty version of it.
2014-10-01 13:55:15	wookiee	sooo, a regular mac?
2014-10-01 13:55:22	wookiee	</trololol>
2014-10-01 13:55:30	Krampus	core Duo macbook.
2014-10-01 13:56:15	wookiee	That was a good chip...
2014-10-01 13:56:35	Krampus	I got a lot of life out of the pentium-M
2014-10-01 13:57:28	wookiee	Indeed, they do make awesome room heaters
2014-10-01 13:58:11	el_seano	greh: so, pretty sure there isn't a universal way to tab around inside of an application; although I think I heard some mumbling somewhere about it being a feature that could be "turned on" in later versions of OS X
2014-10-01 13:58:23	 *	el_seano attempts to sift through browser history
2014-10-01 13:58:44	Krampus	any of you guys use XFCE?  i've noticed there are certain hotkeys that I apparently cannot disable.
2014-10-01 13:58:52	greh	el_seano: yeah I've been looking through preferences, but beyond that I don't know where else to look for that sort of thing
2014-10-01 13:59:13	el_seano	greh: it's one of those hidden plist hacks iirc
2014-10-01 13:59:19	wookiee	are you using the terminal, or are you using iterm?
2014-10-01 13:59:53	greh	wookiee: terminal, I think
2014-10-01 14:00:01	wookiee	hrm
2014-10-01 14:00:14	el_seano	oh wait
2014-10-01 14:00:20	el_seano	I think I misread what you were asking
2014-10-01 14:00:28	greh	I think so too
2014-10-01 14:00:29	el_seano	you want to get to a different window in the same application?
2014-10-01 14:00:36	el_seano	cmd + `
2014-10-01 14:00:42	el_seano	that is, backtick
2014-10-01 14:00:48	greh	I tried that, it doesn't work
2014-10-01 14:01:04	el_seano	mac keyboard?
2014-10-01 14:01:05	wookiee	cmd + { or cmd + }
2014-10-01 14:01:16	greh	el_seano: yeah mac keyboard
2014-10-01 14:01:32	el_seano	hrm
2014-10-01 14:01:45	wookiee	inorite?
2014-10-01 14:04:11	greh	rite
2014-10-01 14:06:44	retrov	greh: Cmd + ~
2014-10-01 14:06:51	retrov	that's for different windows within the same app
2014-10-01 14:07:02	retrov	for different tabs within an app, it unfortunately differs
2014-10-01 14:07:05	wookiee	finally, somebody who has a mac
2014-10-01 14:07:09	el_seano	retrov: apparently not working for her in Terminal.app
2014-10-01 14:07:21	retrov	most cocoa apps use Cmd + Shift + left or right arrow
2014-10-01 14:07:32	retrov	but some apps like Chrome don't work with that
2014-10-01 14:10:27	Wren	So how much stake should I place in York's preparedness quizzes?

2014-10-01 14:16:43	Wren	it's also the math I suck at the most

2014-10-01 15:46:52	lewisrjc	well, it's what, parsing the input (which is small) and then doing optimization on that input and generating code?
2014-10-01 15:47:05	lewisrjc	do they have a block diagram for it's optimization passes?
2014-10-01 15:47:35	lewisrjc	oh, I guess it's a runtime too

2014-10-01 17:26:19	@nUbee	just remember, 7, 8 and 10 are just names for Windows. Since Vista, it's always been Windows 6.x
2014-10-01 17:27:08	wookiee	even if so, consistency in naming keeps people from hating you
2014-10-01 17:27:46	@nUbee	hehe, maybe they should call it Windows X

2014-10-01 17:52:38	Aatrox	i know that makefiles need a tab character, but is it possible to change vim's behavior so that a tab makes 2 spaces?
2014-10-01 17:53:06	clarkb	Aatrox: yes expandtab is what you want
2014-10-01 17:53:18	clarkb	to get two literal spaces on a tab
2014-10-01 17:53:31	alevar	A thought: Windows has never had more than two major versions in a row with a consistent numbering scheme.
2014-10-01 17:53:32	clarkb	if you want the tab character to render as 2 spaces ou need tabwidth?
2014-10-01 17:53:43	alevar	numbering = incrementing
2014-10-01 17:53:53	Aatrox	so when i press tab, it makes two spaces
2014-10-01 17:53:56	clarkb	shiftwidth
2014-10-01 17:54:17	Aatrox	will that be something to put in vimrc?
2014-10-01 17:54:18	clarkb	Aatrox: right but do you want two bytes with the ascii for space or one byte with the ascii for tab rendered as 2 spaces?
2014-10-01 17:54:23	Aatrox	two bytes
2014-10-01 17:54:27	clarkb	yup putting it in the vimrc is fine
2014-10-01 18:04:47	Aatrox	sweet, got that out of the way. now how do i stop the swap file window from coming up 
2014-10-01 18:05:02	Aatrox	i.e. what causes a swap file to be made, even when i save and exit normally?

2014-10-02 19:35:05	ryan	DaKine: yes.
2014-10-02 19:37:53	DaKine	I thought if you opt-in it broke up tuition into 3 chunks that you had to pay at the end of the month for 3 months and if you don't pay off your tuition in full by the deadline it automatically opts you in and that's when you have to pay $100.
2014-10-02 19:38:34	DaKine	To clarify, if you don't opt in but fail to pay tuition by the 6th then it automatically opts you in.
2014-10-02 19:39:32	DaKine	That's how I understood the flyer they sent out.
2014-10-02 19:53:25	ryan	so I guess it pays itself if I opt in

2014-10-03 10:04:44	greh	new day new mac problem
2014-10-03 10:06:13	greh	for some reason when I use screen the terminal only uses a tiny bit of the space to display stuff rather than filling the screen. Google hasn't been any help, I haven't changed anything in bash_profile or rc. Any thoughts on how to fix it?
2014-10-03 10:06:25	@kennobaka	^aF
2014-10-03 10:06:38	clarkb	you may have another session attached from a smaller terminal
2014-10-03 10:06:44	@kennobaka	or kill screen and do a -DDr
2014-10-03 10:06:54	@kennobaka	^kill^disconnect from^
2014-10-03 10:07:00	clarkb	screen is conservative and will do its best to keep the smallest terminal happy
2014-10-03 10:07:10	greh	clarkb: I definitely have exactly that going on
2014-10-03 10:07:47	greh	score it works now
2014-10-03 10:07:53	greh	clarkb++
2014-10-03 10:14:44	MaddHatter	not really smallest; it keeps the first-attached screen happy, even if it's bigger. It will force-fit the current screen if you tell it (as kennobaka described) though.

2014-10-03 11:40:08	clarkb	but you still need a heat
2014-10-03 11:40:40	uberj	one heat
2014-10-03 11:40:54	uberj	that can mange your other heats
2014-10-03 11:41:02	uberj	so really, you only need one heat
2014-10-03 11:41:39	clarkb	your neutron security group is incomplete (no udp)
2014-10-03 11:42:03	uberj	what uses udp?
2014-10-03 11:42:33	clarkb	our asterisk server
2014-10-03 11:42:42	uberj	...
2014-10-03 11:42:55	clarkb	your comment is open up everything then you don't...
2014-10-03 11:43:17	clarkb	this is actually an issue with neutron where there is no way to just say give me an open pipe
2014-10-03 11:43:30	clarkb	you have to have a security group that by default contains filters :/
2014-10-03 11:43:42	uberj	that might be a feature and not a bug
2014-10-03 11:43:49	clarkb	its not
2014-10-03 11:44:15	clarkb	it is misplaced corporate IT requirements
2014-10-03 11:44:30	clarkb	you should have the option to be open to the world.
2014-10-03 11:44:34	 *	uberj relays that message to his opsec team
2014-10-03 11:44:44	clarkb	you should also have the option to be protected
2014-10-03 11:44:53	clarkb	right now you only get the option to be protcted
2014-10-03 11:45:23	clarkb	uberj: the reason we don't like security groups is there is no way to verify at any given point you are protected and neutron has fucked it up in the past such that you were wide open
2014-10-03 11:45:39	clarkb	uberj: so we local firewall everything and open the world in our security groups with like 20 rules
2014-10-03 11:45:44	uberj	https://github.com/mozilla/build-fwunit
2014-10-03 11:45:45	link-bot	mozilla/build-fwunit · GitHub (http://goo.gl/dBjF5O)

2014-10-03 11:46:06	clarkb	not an arbitrary moment
2014-10-03 11:46:24	uberj	its active monitoring, what else to do you want?
2014-10-03 11:46:27	clarkb	having done netowrking for large corporation you never trust intermediate firewalls
2014-10-03 11:46:36	clarkb	uberj: assurance
2014-10-03 11:46:44	clarkb	you can't do that when something else manages the firewalls over there
2014-10-03 11:46:49	clarkb	you can test it every 5 minutes
2014-10-03 11:46:52	clarkb	or every second
2014-10-03 11:47:13	clarkb	but as soon as a single connectio nis let through then allowed to persist because that is how the majority of firewalls work you are fucked
2014-10-03 11:48:05	uberj	so you are saying, because there are caveats to firewalls and security groups we shouldn't use them?
2014-10-03 11:48:11	clarkb	uberj: no
2014-10-03 11:48:19	clarkb	uberj: I am saying use them where you can control them
2014-10-03 11:49:03	clarkb	uberj: a typical corporate IT env is some central body controls all firewalls and no one does firewalls on their side
2014-10-03 11:49:14	clarkb	this has often lead to crying
2014-10-03 11:49:19	uberj	I agree
2014-10-03 11:49:34	clarkb	I prefer to pretend that there are no other firewalls and depend on what I can control
2014-10-03 11:49:49	uberj	ah yes, okay
2014-10-03 11:50:07	clarkb	yes you might end up with slightly higher overall bandwidth utilization but thats cheap compared to lol I was accidentally exposed to the internet for a year because someone in that other department was debugging an network issue
2014-10-03 11:50:19	clarkb	or "neutron had a bug"
2014-10-03 11:51:20	uberj	I would think neutron solves the issue you have with not controlling your fw rules, does it not?
2014-10-03 11:51:35	clarkb	it doesn't
2014-10-03 11:51:37	clarkb	neutron controls them
2014-10-03 11:51:47	clarkb	and has failed to do so properly in the past
2014-10-03 11:52:13	uberj	who would control them if not neutron? hosts running iptables?
2014-10-03 11:52:20	clarkb	uberj: anyways, that template is interesting and I would probably consider it if it idnd't use devstack
2014-10-03 11:52:36	clarkb	uberj: every single one of my hosts has a default deny iptables ruleset yes
2014-10-03 11:52:51	uberj	devstack==fastest way
2014-10-03 11:54:26	bkero	fastest way to...madness?
2014-10-03 11:55:03	uberj	yes
2014-10-03 11:56:05	clarkb	oh no fwunit recommends nose
2014-10-03 11:56:57	 *	uberj braces himself for the test runner holy war
2014-10-03 11:57:21	clarkb	I don't really holy war except nose is like nano and shouldn't be used

2014-10-03 15:03:50	clarkb	its easy `git review` done :)
2014-10-03 15:04:52	uberj	I changed my username on launchpad, would that screw up my gerrit stuff?
2014-10-03 15:05:12	clarkb	uberj: it shouldn't
2014-10-03 15:05:21	clarkb	but if you did something funn with launchpad accounts then it can
2014-10-03 15:05:27	clarkb	its the account level that matters because openid

2014-10-03 15:11:24	nibalizer	gg
2014-10-03 15:14:26	uberj	got it working
2014-10-03 15:15:16	uberj	the gerrit work flow should keep out the easily confused, thats for sure
2014-10-03 15:16:22	clarkb	uberj: what do you find confusing about it? (genuinely curious always looking for feedback on what people trip over so that we can at least be aware of pain points)
2014-10-03 15:16:41	clarkb	uberj: especially since I personally find it about a billion times less confusing that github or bitbucket
2014-10-03 15:16:46	uberj	I complete get how its supposed to work
2014-10-03 15:16:54	uberj	but like, I didn't have my gerrit remote set correctly
2014-10-03 15:17:07	uberj	the ssh fingerprint had changed
2014-10-03 15:17:16	uberj	I needed to upload a new ssh key
2014-10-03 15:17:24	uberj	and git-review was needing to be updated
2014-10-03 15:17:45	swook	DaKine: how was it n^3?
2014-10-03 15:18:04	uberj	clarkb: nothing specifically was difficult and https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow was a good reference
2014-10-03 15:18:04	clarkb	the ssh fingerprint was unfortunate. you can blame heartbleed :( how old was git review? it should work with pretty old git review

2014-10-03 15:18:24	uberj	clarkb: I doubt git-review *needed* to be updated
2014-10-03 15:18:34	uberj	but there was a newer version available
2014-10-03 15:20:00	uberj	clarkb: overall, I've generally been pretty impressed with gerrit and its work flow
2014-10-03 15:20:07	uberj	much better than bugzilla ;)
2014-10-03 15:21:13	clarkb	ok thanks. Ya the ssh fingerprint thing is really annoying
2014-10-03 15:21:35	clarkb	the host keys were manged by puppet, puppet was heartbleed vulnerable so we replaced them :/
2014-10-03 15:22:42	uberj	I think the whole idea of required tests and required peer review before merge is a giant step forward in software development best practices

2014-10-06 11:10:22	MaddHatter	part of the reason for configuration is encapsulation, and environment is by definition global
2014-10-06 11:36:32	greghaynes	yea, so that is exactly why we try to use environment as little as possible for configuration in project I work on

2014-10-06 11:36:42	greghaynes	why we try not to use it

2014-10-06 12:31:03	pilgrimd	greghaynes: I think I'm with Madd on that. Env is public data, so how would you securely pass an authentication token to that app.  Really it just seems to be a practice of displacing configuration files, because where do you configure the things setting the environment.
2014-10-06 12:31:34	pilgrimd	I think I'd rather just package up the app precooked and tell it to look in its CWD for foo.conf.

2014-10-06 12:32:14	greghaynes	ground
2014-10-06 12:32:37	greghaynes	use a config file for things except stuff you need global
2014-10-06 12:33:02	greghaynes	like the path to the config file

2014-10-06 12:35:30	greghaynes	so the security thing is a non-issue AFAICT, files and env vars should have the same security guarantees (and actually you could argue that env vars are more secure because they have same restrictions as a file but dont persist on disk)
2014-10-06 12:35:52	greghaynes	the global thing is more of a its bad sw eng practice
2014-10-06 12:36:23	bkero	greghaynes: I'd argue env vars are less secure. Because I can cat /proc/pid/environ
2014-10-06 12:36:25	pilgrimd	As root, I can look at the environment of any running process, but I can also specify audit-logged ACLs that prevent root from looking at a file.
2014-10-06 12:36:54	greghaynes	bkero: sure, but in what case can you do that and not read a file that would have had the pw
2014-10-06 12:37:27	pilgrimd	greghaynes: Advanced ACL frameworks can prevent root access to files.
2014-10-06 12:37:29	greghaynes	pilgrimd: sure, until they get pulled into ram
2014-10-06 12:37:39	greghaynes	at which point you can read it as much as you want as root
2014-10-06 12:38:06	greghaynes	and im not sure how you would make use of that pw in a file and not pull it into ram
2014-10-06 12:38:35	bkero	greghaynes: when you have selinux limiting intra-user permissions
2014-10-06 12:38:52	bkero	or grsec limiting the abilities of processes
2014-10-06 12:39:32	pilgrimd	greghaynes: You really can't, but there's a step up in access from reading env to reading process memory.
2014-10-06 12:39:42	greghaynes	so, you can devise a way where a process can read a file but a root user on the box cant see what the process read?

2014-10-06 17:18:54	Corbin	Which is much funnier.
2014-10-06 17:20:54	alevar	Alternatively, the "P" company could get into computer-themed adult videos.

2014-10-06 20:55:02	braallen	can somebody tell me how to add to $PATH on chandra 
2014-10-06 20:59:26	lewisrjc	depends on your shell
2014-10-06 20:59:28	lewisrjc	echo $SHELL
2014-10-06 21:00:14	lewisrjc	braallen: ^^
2014-10-06 21:01:16	braallen	bash
2014-10-06 21:01:20	lewisrjc	also what are you doing?
2014-10-06 21:01:36	lewisrjc	go to your home dir
2014-10-06 21:01:38	braallen	its for os with Porter
2014-10-06 21:01:39	lewisrjc	what class are you in?
2014-10-06 21:01:41	lewisrjc	okay
2014-10-06 21:01:44	lewisrjc	thanks
2014-10-06 21:02:10	lewisrjc	you will need to edit your .bashrc for the easiest method of applying this
2014-10-06 21:02:14	braallen	ok
2014-10-06 21:02:22	braallen	by home you mean ~username
2014-10-06 21:02:48	lewisrjc	which....I don't have
2014-10-06 21:03:04	lewisrjc	so if you run cd with no arguments it will take you to $HOME
2014-10-06 21:03:08	lewisrjc	which is your homedir
2014-10-06 21:03:17	lewisrjc	~ is actually ana alias for $HOME
2014-10-06 21:03:21	braallen	i have .bashrc
2014-10-06 21:04:03	lewisrjc	okay 
2014-10-06 21:04:04	lewisrjc	uh
2014-10-06 21:04:06	lewisrjc	1 sec
2014-10-06 21:05:21	lewisrjc	on line 14 you should see source mumble
2014-10-06 21:05:33	lewisrjc	after that put the following line
2014-10-06 21:05:51	lewisrjc	$PATH=<whateveryouwanttoadd>:$PATH
2014-10-06 21:06:14	braallen	ok
2014-10-06 21:06:31	lewisrjc	replace <whateveryouwanttoadd> with the ABSOLUTE path to whatever folder that contains the file you wish to add
2014-10-06 21:06:40	lewisrjc	do not use relative paths
2014-10-06 21:07:10	lewisrjc	then run the following
2014-10-06 21:07:14	lewisrjc	. ./.bashrc
2014-10-06 21:07:24	lewisrjc	and then
2014-10-06 21:07:29	lewisrjc	echo $PATH
2014-10-06 21:07:39	lewisrjc	and your new path should be prepended to the default one
2014-10-06 21:08:16	lewisrjc	a common trick is to add $HOME/bin to your path and then put everything that you want in there
2014-10-06 21:09:00	lewisrjc	specifically to symlink it
2014-10-06 21:09:57	lewisrjc	please note the following a) this is only one way of solving this problem, b) this is a permanent addition to your path, should you want to add to your path for the duration of a shell (login) only, you would need the export? function
2014-10-06 21:11:21	braallen	ok
2014-10-06 21:11:27	braallen	it didnt really work
2014-10-06 21:11:43	braallen	its probably something I did
2014-10-06 21:12:21	clarkb	also the tutors can help with things like this if you want someone to look over your shoulder
2014-10-06 21:12:34	lewisrjc	you haven't modified your .bashrc
2014-10-06 21:12:42	lewisrjc	like, I am looking at it righ now
2014-10-06 21:12:58	lewisrjc	OH
2014-10-06 21:13:00	lewisrjc	I see
2014-10-06 21:13:02	lewisrjc	yes you have
2014-10-06 21:13:19	lewisrjc	you appended it to the same line
2014-10-06 21:13:38	lewisrjc	you need to put that on a new line sorry
2014-10-06 21:13:47	lewisrjc	by "after that," I meant on a new line
2014-10-06 21:14:13	braallen	i tried that too
2014-10-06 21:14:26	braallen	and it gave me same no file or directory error
2014-10-06 21:15:22	lewisrjc	try replacing the ~ with /home
2014-10-06 21:15:26	lewisrjc	oh wait
2014-10-06 21:15:29	lewisrjc	ugh
2014-10-06 21:16:56	lewisrjc	so it will be /home/harry/solaris/public_html/...
2014-10-06 21:18:06	lewisrjc	I don't know if ~ works in paths, you really need to use an absolute path
2014-10-06 21:18:33	lewisrjc	/home/harry/solaris
2014-10-06 21:18:34	braallen	ok
2014-10-06 21:18:37	lewisrjc	not /home/harry/
2014-10-06 21:19:01	lewisrjc	oh, WOW
2014-10-06 21:19:05	lewisrjc	I am dumb
2014-10-06 21:19:08	braallen	what?
2014-10-06 21:19:11	lewisrjc	also remove the $ from the first path
2014-10-06 21:19:22	lewisrjc	so it's PATH=/home/harry/solaris/...
2014-10-06 21:19:32	lewisrjc	not $PATH=/home/harry/solaris
2014-10-06 21:19:54	braallen	so you're saying its /home/harry/solaris/the path I have
2014-10-06 21:20:14	braallen	instead of ~thepathIhave
2014-10-06 21:20:18	lewisrjc	yes
2014-10-06 21:20:24	lewisrjc	and remove the very first $
2014-10-06 21:20:47	braallen	YAY
2014-10-06 21:20:53	lewisrjc	$ dereferences in bash it's making a pointer...or something I am not even sure what that does
2014-10-06 21:21:00	braallen	yeah i understand
2014-10-06 21:21:03	lewisrjc	does blitz run?
2014-10-06 21:21:08	braallen	im going to try
2014-10-06 21:22:31	lewisrjc	oops
2014-10-06 21:22:44	lewisrjc	there's 1 too many "harry";s
2014-10-06 21:23:13	lewisrjc	PATH=/home/harry/solaris/harry/public_html/Blitz/BlitzBin/Sun:$PATH
2014-10-06 21:23:19	lewisrjc	that's what you have
2014-10-06 21:23:21	braallen	yes
2014-10-06 21:23:42	lewisrjc	you need PATH=/home/harry/solaris/public_html/Blitz/BlitzBin/Sun:$PATH
2014-10-06 21:23:51	lewisrjc	note the SECOND harry is deleted
2014-10-06 21:23:56	braallen	yea
2014-10-06 21:24:12	lewisrjc	if you want to double check the path you can try
2014-10-06 21:24:29	lewisrjc	/home/harry/solaris/public_html/Blitz/BlitzBin/Sun/blitz
2014-10-06 21:24:35	lewisrjc	on the command prompt and it should say
2014-10-06 21:25:04	lewisrjc	BLITZ Emulator Error: Input file "a.out" could not be opened
2014-10-06 21:25:17	lewisrjc	that will be the right path + a blitz on the end
2014-10-06 21:26:43	braallen	when I type it in it says no such file or directory
2014-10-06 21:26:59	lewisrjc	did you make sure to source the file
2014-10-06 21:27:00	lewisrjc	?
2014-10-06 21:27:30	lewisrjc	your bashrc is now correct
2014-10-06 21:27:34	lewisrjc	. ./.bashrc
2014-10-06 21:27:40	lewisrjc	should make everything work
2014-10-06 21:27:51	braallen	thank you
2014-10-06 21:28:36	lewisrjc	which asm and which blitz
2014-10-06 21:28:45	lewisrjc	/home/harry/solaris/public_html/Blitz/BlitzBin/Sun/asm
2014-10-06 21:28:54	lewisrjc	/home/harry/solaris/public_html/Blitz/BlitzBin/Sun/blitz
2014-10-06 21:29:01	lewisrjc	those should confirm you are using the right tools
2014-10-06 21:29:18	lewisrjc	anyways, looks like you are good to go, sorry for the confusion
2014-10-06 21:29:38	braallen	no its okay
2014-10-06 21:29:52	lewisrjc	(which is a command that tells you exactly which version of a program is being used, useful, if say you have multiple asm's installed)
2014-10-06 21:30:46	lewisrjc	anyways, good luck with KPL (I think is what you are using? it's been a while)
2014-10-06 21:31:43	braallen	yeah thanks for your help

2014-10-07 11:07:20	Krampus	Anyone know of some Vim variant that lets me had tabbed windows that I can "pull off" into their own window if need be (or recombine)
2014-10-07 11:08:01	Krampus	Or maybe a lightweight IDE with VIM text editing.
2014-10-07 11:09:25	bkero	gvim?
2014-10-07 11:10:48	Krampus	bkero: that's what I use now.  And it has tabs, but if I decide I want to have it be a separate window, I can't do that on the fly.  I've got like 6 to 12 gvim windows open at a time and if they're all separate I spend more time than I like trying to find the one i need. :)
2014-10-07 11:11:08	bkero	Write a vimplugin to do it?
2014-10-07 11:11:17	Krampus	tabs help a little bit, but being able to group/ungroup on the fly would be better.
2014-10-07 11:11:29	Krampus	I could, but that seems like it'd be a solved problem.

2014-10-07 17:38:12	clarkb	uber/lyft make me never want to take regular taxis again
2014-10-07 17:39:04	clarkb	drivers can call you to figure out where you are, you see how far the driver is away and their location to help direct them, its all paperless and amazing for corporate expense systems
2014-10-07 17:40:21	clarkb	it is one of the things Iwill miss from seattle
2014-10-07 17:40:40	eidolon	I wish Uber wasn't, you know, Uber
2014-10-07 17:41:08	eidolon	they're like Rogue in that as appealing as what they produce can be, their business practices ensure I will never give them a dollar
2014-10-07 17:41:21	clarkb	they have started to use some questionable business tactics which is unfortunate because they were winning fair and square with a completely better product
2014-10-07 17:41:31	clarkb	thankfully its a competitive market
2014-10-07 17:41:35	clarkb	and you can lyft instead
2014-10-07 17:42:04	eidolon	I'm not really into the sharing economy startups generally
2014-10-07 17:42:21	clarkb	have you tried riding a regular taxi?
2014-10-07 17:42:26	eidolon	since their business models are all based on 'externalize our capital costs and liability to "contractors"'
2014-10-07 17:42:37	eidolon	taxis fucking suck
2014-10-07 17:42:43	eidolon	that doesn't justify the alternative also being shit
2014-10-07 17:42:50	clarkb	its better shit
2014-10-07 17:42:53	clarkb	or at least it was
2014-10-07 17:42:57	eidolon	for the consumer, only

2014-10-07 17:43:18	eidolon	as far as the drivers go they're being fucked in new and exciting ways
2014-10-07 17:44:19	eidolon	Uber's managing to frame being an illegal taxi operator as some kind of daring new extension of the startupy tech space is pretty masterful though
2014-10-07 17:44:27	eidolon	I will give them that
2014-10-07 17:44:38	clarkb	and I thought they take on liability? so yes costs are externalized (isn't that how it has always worked in that business)
2014-10-07 17:45:08	clarkb	eidolon: thats not a fair characterization of the service. It is explicitly legal in many of the places it operates
2014-10-07 17:45:15	clarkb	eidolon: it does not operate in places where it is illegal like here
2014-10-07 17:50:23	clarkb	ya double checked at least lyft covers their drivers with insurance
2014-10-07 17:51:53	clarkb	(but not in new york I am guessing the cost is higher in new york city?)

2014-10-08 10:16:15	greghaynes	ceilometer is one of those things you avoid as much as possile

2014-10-08 10:22:51	clarkb	uberj nope
2014-10-08 10:23:24	clarkb	It will increase your api requests. cern had info on it related to their deployment
2014-10-08 10:24:21	uberj	greghaynes: but autoscaling :(
2014-10-08 10:24:54	greghaynes	you know what doesnt do any kind of scaling? ceilometer
2014-10-08 10:24:58	greghaynes	badum-tshhh
2014-10-08 10:25:39	uberj	greghaynes: don't you work on heat? its your fault then it uses ceilometer
2014-10-08 10:26:07	greghaynes	huh?
2014-10-08 10:26:17	clarkb	heat uses ceilometer notifications
2014-10-08 10:26:20	greghaynes	heat can use basically anything, it doesnt have a dependency on it
2014-10-08 10:26:24	clarkb	its such crack
2014-10-08 10:26:27	clarkb	it does
2014-10-08 10:26:41	greghaynes	there are some resources in heat that do
2014-10-08 10:26:48	clarkb	everything else is an optional ceilometer thing
2014-10-08 10:26:59	clarkb	but heat was all fuck it we are heat

2014-10-08 10:28:07	greghaynes	we dont monitor via heat
2014-10-08 10:28:23	clarkb	ceilometer isnt monitoring...
2014-10-08 10:28:31	uberj	its the aggregate of it though
2014-10-08 10:28:43	clarkb	its just a firehose
2014-10-08 10:29:02	uberj	and heat asks ceilometer to let it know when things get crazy (i.e. some cpu threashold is reached)
2014-10-08 10:29:17	clarkb	ya heat definitely likes that firehose

2014-10-08 10:30:55	greghaynes	we dont use autoscaling
2014-10-08 10:31:04	greghaynes	but I do agree that its kind of the way they want you to go
2014-10-08 10:31:08	greghaynes	so, yep
2014-10-08 10:31:47	uberj	autoscaling is a *huge* reason for why I'm interested in using HEAT. otherwise I could just write some scripts and use vmware
2014-10-08 10:31:51	greghaynes	there is a patch up to switch us to autoscaling though
2014-10-08 10:31:52	greghaynes	well
2014-10-08 10:32:07	greghaynes	autoscaling didnt exist when we started using it, we were one of the motivators
2014-10-08 10:32:37	uberj	yeah, autoscaling is so cloud
2014-10-08 10:32:51	 *	uberj is clouding to hard right now

2014-10-08 10:44:23	Corbin	bkero: Looks like the goal is to improve AMD APU support while not revealing the fglrx code.
2014-10-08 10:44:24	greghaynes	itll be like those servers that sit in hpcloud seattle office forever
2014-10-08 10:44:27	greghaynes	because of red tape
2014-10-08 10:44:36	Corbin	Makes sense; fglrx's licensing is probably such that it can never be publically disclosed.
2014-10-08 10:44:49	clarkb	Corbin: except they own fglrx so can change licensing...
2014-10-08 10:44:59	greghaynes	depends

2014-10-08 10:45:22	clarkb	I meanI don't expect them to just like I don't expect oracle to make zfs useable with linux
2014-10-08 10:45:23	bkero	Corbin: and they want some closed source portions so they can do things like s3tc without fear of lawsuit
2014-10-08 10:45:27	clarkb	but oracle could do that
2014-10-08 10:45:47	jesusaurus	s3tc?

2014-10-08 10:46:42	bkero	patent encumbered texture compression engine that's integral to good performance on modern OGL
2014-10-08 10:48:52	Corbin	clarkb: I don't think that they actually own fglrx! I think that some of it was contracted out and the result is a big proprietary stack that they couldn't really relicense.
2014-10-08 10:49:30	bkero	Yeah, there's other people's IP in things like the h264 decoder

2014-10-10 00:27:32	kini	Q: Why wasn't D-Bus used instead of the Wayland IPC mechanism?
2014-10-10 00:27:32	kini	A: I wanted to preserve some important properties from the X protocol: the ability to queue up an event or request by just memcpy'ing into the protocol out-buffer. That's what wl_connection_write does. Furthermore, it lets us memcpy several messages into the buffer and only write it all before we go back to blocking in the main loop.

2014-10-10 15:33:26	alevar	tamgc: Yes. Just one bowl.
2014-10-10 15:33:45	Sunshine	alevar: weirder answer, check the dumpster areas around PSU and student lobbies
2014-10-10 15:33:48	alevar	It's a bit annoying not being able to heat up food without heating an oven.
2014-10-10 15:34:00	Sunshine	I've found new in the box ones just chilling from exchange student move out

2014-10-11 21:31:54	armaanhammer	Oh, apparently Ctrl - C works, there must have been some lag
2014-10-11 21:32:24	armaanhammer	on a somewhat related note, why would gdb say this? malloc.c: No such file or directory. 
2014-10-11 21:40:01	armaanhammer	Actually, new question. Do you see anything wrong with this? 
2014-10-11 21:40:01	armaanhammer	array[i] = malloc( (sizeof(char) * maxChars) );
2014-10-11 21:40:35	armaanhammer	It's inside of a for loop, i increments, and the previous line is char * * array;
2014-10-11 21:42:16	armaanhammer	woops, that's not the previous line, it's quite a bit up, it's just how array is defined.
2014-10-11 21:46:00	dondon	armaanhammer: "malloc.c: No such file" is because you don't have the source for all of C where gdb can find it; which is true. Don't step into syscalls, and you won't get that message.
2014-10-11 21:46:33	armaanhammer	what's a syscall? That message showed up when I Crtl Ced because gdb was hanging
2014-10-11 21:47:07	dondon	as for the array... so each array element is a char* that points to a malloc'd place (of maxChars) to store a string? looks fine
2014-10-11 21:47:32	armaanhammer	yes, that's correct
2014-10-11 21:47:58	armaanhammer	but gdb keeps hanging and when Ctrl-C, it talks about that line
2014-10-11 21:48:11	dondon	armaanhammer: so a system call is when you use a function from some library. like malloc() is compiled already, you didn't have the source for it, for gdb to show you
2014-10-11 21:48:27	dondon	armaanhammer: where are you logged in to? it shouldn't be hanging.
2014-10-11 21:48:40	armaanhammer	it hangs on my local machine too
2014-10-11 21:48:45	armaanhammer	I think it's my a.out that hangs

2014-10-15 10:16:01	clarkb	greghaynes: they are more like australia
2014-10-15 10:16:07	clarkb	really low data caps
2014-10-15 10:16:40	clarkb	also australia has that firewall thing so australia is worse than canada and us
2014-10-15 10:19:05	clarkb	canada does have a lot going for it though. Not USA. Ford. And the food is really good
2014-10-15 10:19:49	greghaynes	I assume by Ford you meant Rob Ford
2014-10-15 10:19:53	clarkb	yes
2014-10-15 10:25:23	eidolon	uberj: it seems nice except for the economy being a huge real estate based house of cards
2014-10-15 10:26:17	clarkb	greghaynes: one thing we have going for us on the scale of Internets is that the NSA is spying on everyone else. So we draw on that one :)
2014-10-15 10:29:31	greghaynes	but they spying on us too!
2014-10-15 10:29:49	clarkb	greghaynes: right so in a comparison we are all equal (a draw)
2014-10-15 10:29:56	clarkb	so you can disregard that fact
2014-10-15 10:30:15	greghaynes	hrm
2014-10-15 10:30:24	greghaynes	im just mad becauase my internet sucks so hard
2014-10-15 10:30:41	clarkb	I gave up the best internet you can have in this country to move back to portland

2014-10-15 10:30:53	greghaynes	wow
2014-10-15 10:30:56	greghaynes	thats dedication
2014-10-15 10:31:31	clarkb	though they did recently get bought by centurylink so I can no longer say "100mbit and 1Gbe provided by tiny ISP with no major corporate backing"
2014-10-15 10:31:39	clarkb	but they still operate independently

2014-10-15 12:46:33	clarkb	mock------------------------------------------
2014-10-15 12:48:06	jesusaurus	clarkb: whyfor?
2014-10-15 12:48:31	clarkb	because mocking is stupid. it is a workaround for poorly factored code
2014-10-15 12:49:00	clarkb	if you intend on testing code why are you replacing it
2014-10-15 12:49:10	jesusaurus	in that case, wanna help me write a better test for nodepool?
2014-10-15 12:49:31	clarkb	let me go look at the current one
2014-10-15 12:49:32	jesusaurus	'cause i cant figure out why my mocked out test times out
2014-10-15 12:49:53	clarkb	wait where did it go
2014-10-15 12:49:55	jesusaurus	also im not good at writing tests and dont know much about mock
2014-10-15 12:50:02	clarkb	jesusaurus: so you shouldn't e mocking in nodepool really
2014-10-15 12:50:17	clarkb	bcause nodepool tests are all functional (this is why you need mysql)
2014-10-15 12:50:34	jesusaurus	clarkb: im mocking out task.run so that i can raise a ProxyError on the first run then return true on the second
2014-10-15 12:50:37	clarkb	jesusaurus: can you point me at the code in question? I don't see it in gertty so it must've merged?
2014-10-15 12:51:00	clarkb	oh right this corner case of proxy errors from request
2014-10-15 12:51:06	jesusaurus	74943
2014-10-15 12:51:31	jesusaurus	lifeless was all 'we should test this' and i dont have a reason not to other than testing is hard
2014-10-15 12:52:39	clarkb	jesusaurus: so looking at it I would update your fake-provider machinery to have a fake-provider-proxy-derp that does the right thing
2014-10-15 12:52:45	clarkb	fakes a marginally better than mocks
2014-10-15 12:53:00	jesusaurus	how would i do that?
2014-10-15 12:53:11	jesusaurus	how would i create a new fake-provider?
2014-10-15 12:54:44	clarkb	jesusaurus: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/nodepool/tree/nodepool/fakeprovider.py is where all the fake provider code lives. I think the bit that is important to you is the fake http client

2014-10-15 12:54:58	clarkb	jesusaurus: you would have a second one that throws the proxy exception when called the first time
2014-10-15 12:55:06	clarkb	then is "successful" on subsequent calls
2014-10-15 12:56:19	clarkb	jesusaurus: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/nodepool/tree/nodepool/provider_manager.py#n322 and that is where you would patch it in. arguably that should be monkey patched instead

2014-10-15 12:56:21	clarkb	:/
2014-10-15 12:56:26	clarkb	oh well
2014-10-15 12:58:58	jesusaurus	so i guess i could create a new FakeClient that inherits the current FakeClient then create a new bad_proxy auth that uses the new fake client and create a new fixture that uses the bad_proxy auth
2014-10-15 12:59:30	jesusaurus	ive never done any monkey patching
2014-10-15 12:59:45	clarkb	jesusaurus: or just have FakeClient take an argument that defaults to regular FakeHTTPClient
2014-10-15 12:59:58	clarkb	jesusaurus: but can be set to instantiate FakeDerpHTTPCLient
2014-10-15 13:02:14	clarkb	or you could give proper monkey patching a go. In your test use the monkeypatch fixture, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures, and swap out FAKE_CLIENT.http_client (or whatever the var is)
2014-10-15 13:02:21	clarkb	and swap in a derp client

2014-10-15 15:24:44	stormcrow	Slim: You have a team of three people. Each team gets a packet full of programming problems, and you're given 5 (?) hours to solve as many as you can. Typically, there are 1-2 really easy ones, 1-2 really tough ones, and the others fall somewhere in the spectrum.
2014-10-15 15:25:25	stormcrow	I don't think I have any of the packets from previous years with me now, though. They're probably still up in Seattle.

2014-10-17 12:16:26	pilgrimd	Someone with a lot more CS fu than me would have to explain that, because I can't think of a reason.
2014-10-17 12:17:08	clarkb	pilgrimd: in this case probably to force you to treat oh god my runing env is derping differently than an internal consistency problem
2014-10-17 12:17:42	clarkb	whether or not that is actually valuable? who knows
2014-10-17 12:17:53	Corbin	Python 3 fixes it. Python 2.4 and newer prevent raising anything besides Exceptions and old-style classes.
2014-10-17 12:18:02	pilgrimd	I can see wanting to do that, but in the case where you just want to bail on any exception, it seems a bit counterintuitive.
2014-10-17 12:18:22	Corbin	Python has the Self legacy of "everything is an object" and nobody ever really thought that it would be bad to permit any object to be an exception.

2014-10-17 12:19:18	 *	pilgrimd randomly wonders if you could write an entire program as exceptions.
2014-10-17 12:19:41	pilgrimd	That is use exception handlers as your event-driven model. (Yeah, I know, please don't hit me for suggesting it)
2014-10-17 12:20:02	Corbin	If you think of continuations as more powerful exceptions, then yes, it's possible.
2014-10-17 12:20:14	jesusaurus	okay, so s/Exception/(Exception, EnvironmentError)/ doesnt seem to catch the error
2014-10-17 12:20:16	Corbin	Also `raise SystemExit(main())` is a surprisingly common Python idiom.
2014-10-17 12:20:26	clarkb	pilgrimd: just rewrite select to through an exception with your readables and writables :)
2014-10-17 12:20:43	clarkb	jesusaurus: is the error being thrown in that block?

2014-10-17 13:47:41	anakha	ugh, Facebook URLs are so messy
2014-10-17 13:48:15	clarkb	even urlbot is like lolno
2014-10-17 13:48:20	anakha	haha yep
2014-10-17 13:48:28	clarkb	er link-bot 
2014-10-17 13:48:45	anakha	Though that's probably because it's a link to an image, so it can't grab a title and it probably shit itself because of that

2014-10-17 13:53:42	anakha	In other news...
2014-10-17 13:56:23	anakha	Will be intriguing to see if more people validate that, or if it gets debunked again
2014-10-17 13:58:58	Krampus	yeah, I remember the same story in like 1992.
2014-10-17 14:00:51	Krampus	however if this one actually works and can be small and safe and inexpensive?  Sweet.

2014-10-17 14:03:57	clarkb	nice
2014-10-17 14:04:12	clarkb	all of the tooling exists to do that without a special tool but making it all work together in a securish way can be fun
2014-10-17 14:04:44	Krampus	dondon: i saw that the other day.  I'm wondering if I'd prefer that to keepass.
2014-10-17 14:05:35	dondon	Krampus: well all it is missing from my workflow is an android app, and it s better than where I am with lastpass since thrid-party central server
2014-10-17 14:06:00	dondon	I'll copy the most used items into it and try it for a couple weeks and let you konw
2014-10-17 14:06:40	Krampus	dondon: please do.  Does it store the username with it as well?  Or is the idea to put the login as part of the directory structure / file?
2014-10-17 14:07:07	dondon	looks like the login is the filename
2014-10-17 14:07:58	Krampus	that seems like it'd be a slight security risk, since you're providing the information a) confirmation that the user has an account on service and b) what that login is.
2014-10-17 14:08:34	Krampus	Whereas something like an encrypted database provides no information.
2014-10-17 14:09:12	Krampus	not a dealbreaker, of course, since anyone using pass is likely smart enough to keep all that in an encrypted filesystem to begin with.
2014-10-17 14:09:17	dondon	Krampus: ah, they don't have a format inside the files, so just make up sensible non-account-name filenames for each logical grouping

2014-10-17 14:10:38	tamgc	Krampus: heh 26 would be low compared to some people
2014-10-17 14:10:57	Krampus	tamgc: as soon as i hit 10, I call my sponsor.
2014-10-17 14:11:54	clarkb	tamgc: rax rebooted my server so I am down to I dunno 30?

2014-10-17 14:25:22	anakha	Have any of you used Slack?

2014-10-17 14:26:01	anakha	I was watching a coworker use it and it looks blessedly better than Lync
2014-10-17 14:26:06	greghaynes	on day we can aspire to create clients as good as irc clients
2014-10-17 14:26:19	greghaynes	anakha: way to set the bar low
2014-10-17 14:26:34	anakha	:P
2014-10-17 14:26:35	clarkb	it has an irc portal which makes it >>>>> hipchat
2014-10-17 14:26:38	clarkb	and it is how I use it
2014-10-17 14:26:46	clarkb	POODLE had them derping hard recently though
2014-10-17 14:26:55	clarkb	I was flapping for about 48 hours
2014-10-17 14:26:55	greghaynes	My old work used flowdock which had irc gateway also
2014-10-17 14:27:03	greghaynes	but this was still <<<<< irc
2014-10-17 14:27:05	anakha	What I saw of Slack looked so similar to IRC in how it operates
2014-10-17 14:27:07	clarkb	and now coworker is like I can't SSLv3 :)
2014-10-17 14:27:23	anakha	What does he want to SSLv3 anyways?
2014-10-17 14:27:31	clarkb	the slack connection
2014-10-17 14:27:35	clarkb	apparently his client is old
2014-10-17 14:27:37	anakha	oh, haha
2014-10-17 14:27:42	clarkb	we basically told him to upgrade now please

2014-10-17 22:11:05	kini	<bofh> the way I typically start an explanation of how .doc works to someone at least a bit familiar with Microsoft formats is "so ever opened up a .doc file in notepad and saw a few lines of y-with-umlaut in it?" "yeah" "that's what hex character 255 in the default notepad codepage is rendered as. now, in FAT32, 255/0xFF is used in the file allocation table to denote unallocated space." "???... what does this have to do with... oh god, ...
2014-10-17 22:11:05	kini	<bofh> ... you're telling me" "yes, .doc is a weird specific extension of a FAT32 filesystem image"
2014-10-17 22:11:05	kini	<bofh> (which, yes, it is)
2014-10-17 22:11:07	kini	what the fuck lmao
2014-10-17 22:13:18	Corbin	To be specific, .doc is designed to overlap perfectly with the in-memory structure of Word.
2014-10-17 22:13:32	Corbin	This allowed Word to load .doc files with a mmap().

2014-10-18 10:45:19	Corbin	Wow, Arch is so damn broken.
2014-10-18 10:45:29	Corbin	It doesn't install pkg-config by default, and it installs libraries in weird places.
2014-10-18 10:48:30	clarkb	didnt they flatten all the bins too?
2014-10-18 10:49:18	Corbin	Some of them.
2014-10-18 10:49:32	Corbin	So, for example, somebody was just failing to build PyPy because libffi wasn't in a normal place.
2014-10-18 10:49:51	Corbin	PyPy searches several different spots, because all distros move libffi around, and falls back to pkg-config.
2014-10-18 10:50:07	Corbin	Arch picked a spot that I've never seen before: /usr/lib/libffi-3.1/include
2014-10-18 10:50:42	Corbin	Of course! The includes are in /usr/lib.

2014-10-18 14:03:24	lewisrjc	bkero: even then, it's not obscure just unstable
2014-10-18 14:03:34	lewisrjc	I remember when they collapsed the diffrent bins
2014-10-18 14:03:44	lewisrjc	that was interesting days
2014-10-18 14:03:55	lewisrjc	it was really awkward, because I agreed with their reasoning
2014-10-18 14:04:48	lewisrjc	but i had to do some manual munging to get things right
2014-10-18 14:05:09	lewisrjc	the switch to systemd was...interesting
2014-10-18 14:05:29	clarkb	python2 to python3 was full of problems.
2014-10-18 14:05:49	clarkb	mostly I am ok with all this because arch users know what they are getting into and a distro somewhere has to be willing to operate close to the future
2014-10-18 14:06:02	clarkb	can you imagine what the world would be like if centos and debian were our only options?
2014-10-18 14:09:04	lewisrjc	clarkb: The power of having access to a) updated libraries B) not have weird custom logic baked into the distro has been repeatedly more valuable than the pain
2014-10-18 14:09:11	lewisrjc	the systemd transition was acid

2014-10-18 14:15:34	greghaynes	I dont get the updated libraries argument
2014-10-18 14:15:59	greghaynes	you can just enable package repos for most any distro if you want the newest libs that are unstable
2014-10-18 14:19:49	clarkb	not centos
2014-10-18 14:38:29	lewisrjc	greghaynes: depending on the distro it is varying levels of obnoxious
2014-10-18 14:38:44	lewisrjc	centos is particularly bad

2014-10-18 18:57:52	clarkb	115 of us according to weechat
2014-10-18 18:58:19	Zero	I wonder if they're all real or some are bots. :)
2014-10-18 18:58:49	clarkb	some are definitely bots
2014-10-18 18:58:52	Zero	Did you go to the Braindump?
2014-10-18 18:59:08	clarkb	karmabot, link-bot, pilgrimd all bots
2014-10-18 18:59:08	karmabot	What?
2014-10-18 18:59:26	clarkb	I did long ago
2014-10-18 18:59:30	Zero	I see.
2014-10-18 18:59:45	Zero	I'm new. It's my first term at PSU.
2014-10-18 19:00:17	Zero	I was just wondering if we're supposed to get some email about our new CAT accounts.
2014-10-18 19:01:19	clarkb	I am not sure. In the past you got everything the weekafter the deal then just have to wait for johnj to push all the account creation through
2014-10-18 19:01:35	Zero	I see.
2014-10-18 19:05:20	taron	anybody happen to know where within walking distance of campus I could get either a vga to dvi converter or a shitload of hdmi cables?
2014-10-18 19:07:58	clarkb	target, office depot, radio shack?
2014-10-18 19:08:37	taron	jesus christ how did I forget target
2014-10-18 19:08:38	taron	apologies
2014-10-18 19:11:01	vjones	I'm definitely probably not a bot
2014-10-18 19:13:20	Zero	Don't get the wrong DVI cable. :P
2014-10-18 19:13:33	clarkb	taron also I am sure nibalizer and greghaynes would want me to mention the internet. last time I did brick and mortar store they insisted I just amazon instead
2014-10-18 19:14:01	@krinkle	Zero: did you get signed up for mentor sessions? they'll give you everything you need next week
2014-10-18 19:14:25	Zero	I did. The only thing I know is that I have a mentor session on Wednesday.
2014-10-18 19:14:34	@krinkle	then you're fine

2014-10-18 19:15:49	taron	yeah I just have this shiny new monitor sitting next to me and don't really want to wait for amazon or newegg to use it. but such is life. especially since I just realized i'd have to buy even more converters to use hdmi anyway
2014-10-18 19:16:13	taron	and speaking of mentor sessions, did anyone who was at induction last night write down the room for the saturday ones?
2014-10-18 19:16:23	taron	i'd been in the building since 10AM and just wanted to go home at that point
2014-10-18 19:16:25	relsqui	taron: EB 325 :)
2014-10-18 19:16:25	Zero	Maybe Craigslist.

2014-10-18 19:17:10	taron	that was the only one for the moment
2014-10-18 19:17:27	relsqui	taron: if you tell me your name I'll put your nick on the attendance sheet for your session, I was just making that :P
2014-10-18 19:17:34	relsqui	but I only know a few people's nicks so far
2014-10-18 19:17:42	taron	should be listed as Emma Barber
2014-10-18 19:18:05	Zero	I missed about 15 minutes of last night. I came late. Traffic coming in from Gresham. :P

2014-10-18 19:18:50	taron	one of these days i'll stop being lazy and actually fix my ptr records

2014-10-18 19:19:14	relsqui	ah, you're with me on wednesday! cool
2014-10-18 19:19:19	Zero	Lol. Nice.
2014-10-18 19:19:44	taron	i should've picked up something on wednesday or friday so i'd have an excuse to leave the arc office for a few hours
2014-10-18 19:19:44	relsqui	how d'you pronounce your first name?
2014-10-18 19:20:06	Zero	Boon noy.
2014-10-18 19:20:07	relsqui	taron: haha. you can switch if you want, we're not super strict about it as long as you make it to a session each week
2014-10-18 19:20:14	relsqui	friday's full, though, iirc
2014-10-18 19:20:17	relsqui	Zero: thanks
2014-10-18 19:20:20	Zero	Np.
2014-10-18 19:20:51	taron	what time are the ones on wednesday? i might be stuck in a meeting anyway
2014-10-18 19:20:57	relsqui	4pm
2014-10-18 19:21:23	relsqui	(only one per day, monday-saturday)
2014-10-18 19:21:50	taron	damn, still usually stuck in the oit conference room at that point
2014-10-18 19:22:13	relsqui	ah, c'est la vie
2014-10-18 19:22:42	taron	can't really complain, I get paid for it
2014-10-18 19:22:46	relsqui	haha, yeah
2014-10-18 19:22:59	relsqui	this is also how I justify how much time I spend at the CAT >_>
2014-10-18 19:23:01	relsqui	I mean, I did that anyway
2014-10-18 19:23:04	relsqui	but getting paid helps
2014-10-18 19:23:18	taron	would be nice if someone actually turned the lights on in fab 90 once in a while though
2014-10-18 19:24:19	taron	my dad asked me today whether I'd gone hiking or talked to people outside of CS stuff since moving up here and I just looked at him and said something along the lines of "what is outside?"
2014-10-18 19:24:24	pilgrimd	clarkb: I'm not a bot. My programming says nothing about me being a bot.
2014-10-18 19:24:46	relsqui	lol

2014-10-18 19:25:33	taron	since whenever this year's move in day was... so just under a month
2014-10-18 19:25:48	relsqui	woo. welcome.
2014-10-18 19:26:13	Zero	Nice. Hope you like rain.
2014-10-18 19:26:16	relsqui	I live off-campus but cut it about as close, I think I moved in 2-3 weeks before classes started
2014-10-18 19:26:17	Zero	Lol.
2014-10-18 19:26:20	relsqui	(two years ago)
2014-10-18 19:26:32	relsqui	it's a good icebreaker for those first-day-of-class things
2014-10-18 19:26:36	relsqui	"hi I've been in oregon for three weeks, sup
2014-10-18 19:26:37	relsqui	"
2014-10-18 19:26:43	taron	lol
2014-10-18 19:26:58	taron	takes me 20 minutes to explain where I'm from to anyone
2014-10-18 19:27:04	relsqui	I'll bite, where are you from?
2014-10-18 19:27:40	taron	born in springfield, grew up in columbus, ohio, went to ohio state for three years while my parents moved back to corvallis, just came back out this summer
2014-10-18 19:27:52	relsqui	heh, I see
2014-10-18 19:28:03	pilgrimd	relsqui: That works better if you're wearing chucks and sipping a PBR.
2014-10-18 19:28:12	relsqui	lol
2014-10-18 19:28:20	relsqui	I didn't own chucks until like a month ago
2014-10-18 19:28:24	relsqui	but I bought them from a thrift store, so there's that
2014-10-18 19:28:24	pilgrimd	Hah! See?
2014-10-18 19:28:30	relsqui	:P
2014-10-18 19:28:34	taron	i think i actually met more hipsters in columbus than I have here so far
2014-10-18 19:28:45	taron	not counting people with incredible looking beards anyway
2014-10-18 19:28:48	relsqui	when you meet mancat ask him about his theory of hipsters
2014-10-18 19:28:49	@kennobaka	oh, don't worry; you'll meet them
2014-10-18 19:29:01	relsqui	it's carefully considered and surprisingly nuanced
2014-10-18 19:29:05	pilgrimd	karmabot: portland is more infectious than ebola, but not as lethal
2014-10-18 19:29:05	karmabot	Affirmative, pilgrimd.
2014-10-18 19:29:06	relsqui	(he's also a giant hipster)
2014-10-18 19:29:19	taron	heh
2014-10-18 19:29:26	relsqui	so much so that he self-describes that way, just because no one would ever *expect* him to
2014-10-18 19:29:35	pilgrimd	So my brother and his family were in town this week.
2014-10-18 19:30:12	pilgrimd	I mentioned hipsters to my sister in law and Mason (my nephew) overheard, then contributed that he likes hamsters, too.
2014-10-18 19:30:29	pilgrimd	So now I have hipsters == hamsters programmed into my head.
2014-10-18 19:30:32	taron	the short north in columbus is an excellent example of that infection
2014-10-18 19:30:51	taron	i think they hit critical mass of queer-identified people and hipsters in a small space
2014-10-18 19:31:21	relsqui	pilgrimd: seems reasonable

2014-10-18 19:32:10	karmabot	OK, kennobaka.
2014-10-18 19:32:14	taron	it's the internet, of course it's a thing
2014-10-18 19:32:30	pilgrimd	Also, a people-size habitrail would be awesome.
2014-10-18 19:32:45	taron	i would never leave
2014-10-18 19:32:53	@kennobaka	pilgrimd: not if it were full of hipsters
2014-10-18 19:33:20	taron	just put several cases of pbr at one end of it and they'll leave you alone
2014-10-18 19:33:22	@kennobaka	I don't even know what that much irony crammed into a confined space would do
2014-10-18 19:33:35	pilgrimd	kennobaka: The nice thing about it being tubes is all you have to do every now and then is attach one of those giant shop fans at one end and blow out the accumulated hipsters.
2014-10-18 19:33:53	@kennobaka	ooh, right into the williamette?
2014-10-18 19:34:05	@kennobaka	swimming is mainstream, right? so they won't do it
2014-10-18 19:34:09	@kennobaka	right? right?
2014-10-18 19:34:13	pilgrimd	kennobaka: Yeah, we would invite Red Bull over and stage a hipster-launching competition.
2014-10-18 19:34:46	@kennobaka	I think we should probably get them hipsterhamster balls, for aerodynamic purposes
2014-10-18 19:34:47	clarkb	hiptag?
2014-10-18 19:34:54	@kennobaka	flugster?
2014-10-18 19:38:54	taron	maybe if you put a band no one's ever heard of on the other side of the river they'll just walk in and solve the problem themselves
2014-10-18 19:39:14	taron	then again you don't get the satisfaction of watching them sulk as they fly out of the cannon

2014-10-18 20:00:27	relsqui	.... or just use tools other than irssi for leaving notes for myself, I guess
2014-10-18 20:00:31	relsqui	but what's the fun in that
2014-10-18 20:00:34	pilgrimd	I just message myself stuff like that.
2014-10-18 20:00:39	pilgrimd	or put it in my phone
2014-10-18 20:01:32	relsqui	yeah, if it were meant to be for more than a couple of minutes I'd use something more permanent
2014-10-18 20:01:41	relsqui	but this was just jotting down the thing I just thought off to add to this presentation
2014-10-18 20:01:44	relsqui	while I'm still working on another piece
2014-10-18 20:02:05	taron	i've taken to just keeping a sheet of paper and a pen in front of me at all times
2014-10-18 20:02:16	taron	except then my desk makes me look like a madman

2014-10-18 20:02:38	pilgrimd	taron: You should try setting up a wallboard for that. Keeps the desk clean.
2014-10-18 20:03:02	pilgrimd	Then, if you need to make a series of notes, you can indicate their serial nature by adding string or yarn connecting them.
2014-10-18 20:03:13	relsqui	that++
2014-10-18 20:03:19	pilgrimd	Maybe even practice some scrapbooking on it with news clippings and other mementos.
2014-10-18 20:03:22	taron	what i'd really like is a whiteboard but it's not really possible in a dorm
2014-10-18 20:03:37	relsqui	aw, sad
2014-10-18 20:03:45	pilgrimd	taron: It totally is! You can get whiteboards at Office Despot.
2014-10-18 20:03:54	taron	not in the size I want lol
2014-10-18 20:04:00	pilgrimd	You sure?
2014-10-18 20:04:16	relsqui	I got a giant white board for my birthday a few years ago, I was so happy
2014-10-18 20:04:18	taron	I mean I'm sure they have them but I don't have the room to fit it in here
2014-10-18 20:04:51	relsqui	when I moved to portland, we put it up in the living room -- it's really handy as a house whiteboard, but I miss having one in my room to study with
2014-10-18 20:05:12	pilgrimd	I had a porcelain 4x8 whiteboard for a while
2014-10-18 20:05:22	relsqui	(I learned IPA on it -- every time I walked by I'd stop and redraw the chart for General American English, check it, correct any mistakes, and then erase it)
2014-10-18 20:05:59	taron	...I just realized it's been less than a year since I took a linguistics class and I've already forgotten IPA. :<
2014-10-18 20:06:13	relsqui	eh, you'd be surprised how much it comes back
2014-10-18 20:06:26	taron	true
2014-10-18 20:06:30	taron	i just don't really use it for anything
2014-10-18 20:06:33	relsqui	sort of by accident I've only been taking linguistics classes in fall terms, so it's been a year since I took any and two years since I took one that used IPA
2014-10-18 20:06:38	relsqui	but it only took a little refreshing
2014-10-18 20:06:54	taron	was big into conlanging when I was younger but just don't have the time now
2014-10-18 20:06:58	relsqui	yeahh
2014-10-18 20:07:08	relsqui	the pickier you are about doing it well, the more time and energy it takes, heh
2014-10-18 20:07:46	pilgrimd	When I have stuff I need to memorize, I type it out on a small piece of paper and stick it to the edge of my monitor.
2014-10-18 20:07:57	pilgrimd	Without realizing it, I look at it dozens of times a day.

2014-10-18 20:08:29	relsqui	heh, I just learned that from hanging around hams
2014-10-18 20:08:32	relsqui	and studying for the test
2014-10-18 20:08:44	pilgrimd	I just use it for spelling things over the phone.
2014-10-18 20:09:27	pilgrimd	"Papa India Lima Golf Romeo India Mike" is way clearer, since there are three homophonous letters in both my first and last names.
2014-10-18 20:10:05	taron	hm, I should learn that
2014-10-18 20:10:09	pilgrimd	And all you gorram American's can't spell my first name to save your lives! *monocled english muttering*
2014-10-18 20:11:30	taron	the number of people who manage to screw up my last name despite it being a common english word is impressive

2014-10-18 21:23:15	pilgrimd	that's a local version, so not surprising
2014-10-18 21:23:36	Wren	I would have guessed that, since that's how the street is spelled. Though I had to look that up too, I always think it's Barbour.
2014-10-18 21:24:29	taron	well it was misspelled more often in Columbus, but I don't think there was a street there by that name
2014-10-18 21:24:32	taron	which is odd, but oh well

2014-10-19 21:22:16	commander	how can i concatenate bits into unsigned int as im reading from a file.
2014-10-19 21:23:37	commander	for example, if file has 01 4, i pad with 2 zeros on the left so it becomes 0010, then i add it to unsigned int with left shift, 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

2014-10-19 21:41:20	@kennobaka	commander: I'm not sure why you wouldn't just read in a whole int at a time
2014-10-19 21:43:07	commander	but its not ascii, its bits
2014-10-19 21:47:38	@kennobaka	ascii is just bits cast to a char
2014-10-19 21:49:53	commander	ok, i just read into char[] then atoi
2014-10-19 21:50:07	commander	but i want to concatenate as im reading
2014-10-19 21:51:25	commander	so if i were to read the second line in file, "1011 5", i need to pad it with one zero on the left, 0010 11, then concat to the previos one (21:23), so the whole thing looks like
2014-10-19 21:51:57	commander	0010 0101 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
2014-10-19 21:52:22	commander	sorrt "1011 5" would be 0101 1
2014-10-19 21:53:17	@kennobaka	you'll probably want to look at strtol(3)
2014-10-19 21:53:51	@kennobaka	rather than atoi; strtol will let you specify that the first number is in base 2, rather than base 10
2014-10-19 21:55:40	@kennobaka	once you get the bit-shifting figured out; you can use either | or + to join two unsigned ints together

2014-10-19 23:44:54	Corbin	Of course, when we say "byte" here we mean an eight-bit value.
2014-10-19 23:45:08	commander	ff is 1111 1111?
2014-10-19 23:45:21	Corbin	Yeah.
2014-10-19 23:46:34	commander	ok. if i understand your function correctly, while i exists, maskoff the least significant 8 digits, extract the character and do stuff with that char?
2014-10-19 23:46:50	commander	and skip next 8 bits
2014-10-19 23:47:05	Corbin	Well, not skip, but yeah. Discard them.

2014-10-19 23:49:08	commander	yes true.
2014-10-19 23:49:56	commander	I have write those 8 bits to a file, should i just replace dostuff function with some writeout function?

2014-10-20 00:05:45	@kennobaka	commander: 0xff is really like 0x000000ff in this case; you just need to change the mask to be the most-significant bits instead of least-significant

2014-10-20 10:36:45	commander	pilgrimd: ^ that was for you haha
2014-10-20 10:37:00	anakha	Though the answer to that involves shifting bits around and then reassembling them
2014-10-20 10:37:13	commander	yes im playing around with it
2014-10-20 10:37:15	anakha	I recommend researching how the C bit shift operators work

2014-10-20 10:39:18	greghaynes	its pretty well known as the go-to for that type of question
2014-10-20 10:39:26	pilgrimd	commander: From your example, it looks like you actually want to do byte-order reversal, not bit-order reversal?
2014-10-20 10:39:47	greghaynes	yea, youre just swapping endian-ness it looks lie
2014-10-20 10:39:49	greghaynes	er, like
2014-10-20 10:39:51	commander	yes sorry for confusion
2014-10-20 10:41:23	commander	i have an unsigned int which holds 32 bit, i want to copy the least significant byte to temp int and so on
2014-10-20 10:41:41	greghaynes	int % 255
2014-10-20 10:41:50	pilgrimd	Ok, byte order reversal is pretty straight forward.  Consider that what you need to do is take each byte of the int and move it to a different location.  Since you're retaining the bit-order of each byte, you don't have to worry about the endian-sensitive value changing.
2014-10-20 10:42:40	greghaynes	or if you know endian-ness for sure you can use hax
2014-10-20 10:42:45	pilgrimd	For example, 0x12345678 becomes 0x78563412, not 0x87654321.
2014-10-20 10:42:45	greghaynes	and just mask out the bytes you want
2014-10-20 10:44:08	clarkb	mod isn't that slow on modern hardware though
2014-10-20 10:44:33	greghaynes	totally, and in reality your compiler will change that to a mask

2014-10-20 12:07:57	b	would drive down the profits in clark county, fo sho

2014-10-20 12:12:38	b	interesting
2014-10-20 12:12:59	b	also, it's a per-capita chart, and there are way more people in king county than clark county, i imagine
2014-10-20 12:13:11	b	seattle vs vancouver
2014-10-20 12:13:40	b	king county might actually have MORE sales revenue, but when represented as per-capita, it just looks like less
2014-10-20 12:14:41	clarkb	bkero: also no stores
2014-10-20 12:14:49	clarkb	because schools parks etc
2014-10-20 12:29:14	pilgrimd	b: Well, in Seattle, people are usually too busy to smoke a lot of weed.  There isn't much to do in clark county.
2014-10-20 12:29:40	clarkb	also I bet those numbers don't include that delivery service
2014-10-20 12:30:18	pilgrimd	I look at the chart and think, "Huh, sales data indicates less urban areas have more people doing recreational drugs. Why is this news?"
2014-10-20 12:30:24	b	pilgrimd: i think that's a pretty specious argument. Plenty of folks can toke up and be WAY productive.

2014-10-20 14:24:32	anakha	require attaching functions to classes/objects? You mean like delegates?
2014-10-20 14:26:06	pilgrimd	or member functions?
2014-10-20 14:26:30	anakha	^
2014-10-20 14:26:33	relsqui	I think he means require as opposed to allow
2014-10-20 14:27:58	pilgrimd	Well... now I have to ask if explicit or implicit, because both Java and C++ have implicit mandatory functions in all classes.
2014-10-20 14:31:29	lewisrjc	alevar: C# at the very least
2014-10-20 14:31:58	lewisrjc	for reference I am like 90% certain that alevar is referring to the fact that Java doesn't allow free floating functions
2014-10-20 14:32:04	lewisrjc	I think scala as well...?
2014-10-20 14:32:06	relsqui	yeah, that
2014-10-20 14:32:11	relsqui	require that functions be in classes
2014-10-20 14:32:15	relsqui	as opposed to merely allowing themt o be
2014-10-20 14:32:31	pilgrimd	oh, well technically C++, because everything needs a scope.
2014-10-20 14:32:43	anakha	OH
2014-10-20 14:32:45	lewisrjc	specifically require static functions to be members of a class
2014-10-20 14:32:50	anakha	That's what he meant
2014-10-20 14:33:09	lewisrjc	pilgrimd: being in global scope is different than being a static member of a class...
2014-10-20 14:33:30	lewisrjc	I could be wrong on this but that's very close to a common question
2014-10-20 14:33:42	anakha	Java, C#, VB.NET, maybe Ruby?
2014-10-20 14:33:56	lewisrjc	ermmm....
2014-10-20 14:34:51	lewisrjc	everything that compiles to the JVM actually now that I think about it...that's not a guarantee but I am pretty sure you can't have executing code outside of a class in the JVM

2014-10-20 14:35:36	lewisrjc	a language could have syntactic sugar that wraps everything not in a class into a class in a special namespace but I don't think anyone does that
2014-10-20 14:35:39	lewisrjc	so scala...
2014-10-20 14:36:48	anakha	It's an interesting question, though. I've never really paid attention to what classes specifically do and don't require functions to reside in classes
2014-10-20 14:38:32	lewisrjc	in Java it has to do with the JVM architecture iirc
2014-10-20 14:39:00	lewisrjc	it looks like Ruby is the same
2014-10-20 14:39:07	 *	lewisrjc digs into small talk
2014-10-20 14:40:56	lewisrjc	yeah, small talk has this property, it has some ramifications with types, note that this means that every mthod (there aren't really any functions) is attached to a class which is rooted
2014-10-20 14:41:04	lewisrjc	(a rooted tree specifically)
2014-10-20 14:41:55	lewisrjc	so all code is attached to something in the type heirarchy, you can't just have a chunk of code floating around outside the rooted object system
2014-10-20 14:44:25	lewisrjc	come to think of it the only language I know that really has functions is python
2014-10-20 14:44:48	lewisrjc	or I am wrong and ruby does allow free floating functions
2014-10-20 14:44:50	lewisrjc	nevermind
2014-10-20 14:45:07	nightfly	yeah, it has like several flavors of function like things
2014-10-20 14:45:21	nightfly	(and js has functions)
2014-10-20 14:45:38	lewisrjc	are they objects as well?
2014-10-20 14:45:49	nightfly	yes, they are
2014-10-20 14:45:50	lewisrjc	alevar: are python functions objects?
2014-10-20 14:46:12	lewisrjc	nightfly: and ruby has a rooted type system (i.e. everything derives from "object")
2014-10-20 14:48:20	nightfly	I meant js functions are objects, not sure about ruby. Ruby has lambdas (Procs) and also has blocks which I think are one of the few things in Ruby that aren't objects. Not really sure how blocks work
2014-10-20 14:49:16	lewisrjc	mmkay
2014-10-20 14:49:31	lewisrjc	it looks like python also has all functions being objects with a special operator overloaded
2014-10-20 14:50:34	lewisrjc	which is actually really similar to the way java does stuff

2014-10-20 15:05:26	uberj	yeah I know that. I would expect the template to pull in a cookbook or something
2014-10-20 15:05:30	greghaynes	but would be a lot more painful than using $config_mgmt
2014-10-20 15:05:45	greghaynes	yep, so making those generalised is not a thing ive really seen so far
2014-10-20 15:05:56	greghaynes	in theory its possible, but ive yet to see it happen
2014-10-20 15:05:57	uberj	its the setting up of the autoscaling groups and ports and all the IaaS stuff that you could get with heat
2014-10-20 15:06:25	uberj	and maybe two software configs for setting up the slave and master
2014-10-20 15:06:46	greghaynes	Yep, everything ive seen for that so far is eitehr example templates or super use-case specific templates

2014-10-21 10:50:53	sabreman	is there any way to install both the ATI and NVIDIA drivers on ubuntu? 
2014-10-21 10:51:17	sabreman	i'm have aportable instalation and dont wanna change drivers every time.
2014-10-21 10:51:50	Corbin	sabreman: Yes, but only if you use the open-source drivers for both chipsets.
2014-10-21 10:52:10	Corbin	Both fglrx and nvidia desire control of libgl.so, and Mesa also insists on owning it.

2014-10-21 10:53:44	sabreman	ok cool
2014-10-21 10:54:10	sabreman	i dont care about using the propriatary drivers, since i'lll only use this for work
2014-10-21 10:54:58	clarkb	you can probably have something insmod the correct driver based on hardware probing if you use propietary drivers?
2014-10-21 10:55:02	clarkb	can udev do that?
2014-10-21 10:55:48	Corbin	You'd also need to rotate the userspace.
2014-10-21 10:56:06	Corbin	There's a Gentoo eselect for this, but TBH it's not a very good idea to go down this road.
2014-10-21 10:56:24	sabreman	i'll just stick with open source, it's cool
2014-10-21 10:56:25	clarkb	oh userspace can't coexist?
2014-10-21 10:56:27	clarkb	that is silly
2014-10-21 10:56:33	Corbin	It has to do with libgl.so
2014-10-21 10:56:51	sabreman	thanks Corbin 
2014-10-21 10:56:57	Corbin	libgl.so's user-facing API is fixed by spec, but of course the backend wants to talk to different (sub)drivers.
2014-10-21 10:57:36	Corbin	So there's several different backend APIs: Catalyst and NVIDIA have their own, and Mesa also has one which is explicitly unstable and unexported in order to keep people from writing half-open drivers.
2014-10-21 10:58:17	Corbin	sabreman: No worries.

2014-10-21 11:15:39	nibalizer	... somehow
2014-10-21 11:15:42	clarkb	yes billing happens
2014-10-21 11:15:44	nibalizer	i used a credit card
2014-10-21 11:15:48	clarkb	once my amex got billed a giant amount of money
2014-10-21 11:15:49	nibalizer	thats right
2014-10-21 11:15:54	clarkb	like OSHIT! money

2014-10-21 12:20:22	pilgrimd	bkero: We had first-class upgrades for the rest of the year on flights to conventions.
2014-10-21 12:20:31	bkero	slick
2014-10-21 12:21:02	pilgrimd	I think it's why I hate flying now, because I spent most of a year with my butt in a comfy leather seat twice a month.
2014-10-21 12:21:41	bkero	You could just take enough ambien to make yourself think that you're in a comfy leather seat
2014-10-21 12:21:52	bkero	Fact: it's cheaper than the upgrade
2014-10-21 12:24:20	taron	I can't remember the last time I even flew on an airline that had first class seating
2014-10-21 12:25:09	taron	oh nvm apparently alaska has them
2014-10-21 12:25:40	bkero	Yeah
2014-10-21 12:26:02	taron	their economy seating is so sad looking it's hard to believe there is such a thing
2014-10-21 12:26:18	bkero	Alaska is one of the better carriers
2014-10-21 12:26:47	taron	only flown with them once so I wouldn't know
2014-10-21 12:26:50	taron	usually done southwest
2014-10-21 12:28:47	taron	edmonton intl -> seatac -> pdx the seats were pretty well beat to shit but maybe it was just the plane I was on
2014-10-21 12:29:28	bkero	THey've redone their stuff in the last year or two
2014-10-21 12:29:40	bkero	Refreshed some old frames they had too. Their fleet is aging.
2014-10-21 12:30:41	taron	glad to hear it, seems to be the best way to get up to edmonton from here

2014-10-21 12:40:31	taron	another drive I would never recommend to anyone, though it wasn't nearly as bad as columbus to corvallis
2014-10-21 12:41:10	bkero	I did Seattle -> Missoula last night. It was only around 7.5 hours, quite easy. I got through two chapters of Anathem.
2014-10-21 12:41:48	taron	I just find the multiday drives wear on my nerves quite a bit.
2014-10-21 12:44:30	taron	nonstop flight from chicago to tokyo was easier just cause I got it all done in one go

2014-10-22 22:01:54	kini	<pilgrimd> kini: but if you want to be pedantic, double negation is what DeMorgan's collapses to when the inner expression is a single term.
2014-10-22 22:01:54	kini	not true - demorgan's laws (in variadic form) would be ~(\bigwedge p_i) = \bigvee ~p_i and ~(\bigvee p_i) = \bigwedge ~p_i
2014-10-22 22:01:54	kini	when the inner expression is a single term, that collapses to ~(p_i) = ~p_i and ~(p_i) = ~p_i, which is not double negation
2014-10-22 22:02:11	kini	(it's just a trivial equality)
2014-10-22 22:02:44	kini	and this is not just pedantry, it's important to the difference between constructivist and classical logic, which plays a large role in CS foundations
2014-10-22 22:06:15	pilgrimd	kini: good to know. do you want to email that smbc bloke and tell him he was wrong on the internet?
2014-10-22 22:06:45	kini	no, since you're the one who said what I objected to
2014-10-22 22:08:16	pilgrimd	kini: ah well in that case I'm sorry the factual incorrectness of my humour so deeply offended you
2014-10-22 22:08:53	kini	does the d in pilgrimd stand for defensive
2014-10-22 22:09:26	pilgrimd	kini: ad hominem. good night.

2014-10-22 23:28:33	Lazuruz	Just wondering if anyone has or knows of a good tutorial for setting up SSL with ZNC.  Im realitivly new to IRC and very new to ZNC.  Thanks in advance
2014-10-22 23:29:42	taron	Lazuruz: I just followed this https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-znc-an-irc-bouncer-on-an-ubuntu-vps

2014-10-22 23:31:14	Lazuruz	excellent thanks.
2014-10-22 23:31:50	taron	np
2014-10-22 23:36:53	taron	other way you could do it is irssi with screen, just trying that out now though so I dunno how it compares or what the advantages of either one are
2014-10-22 23:39:03	relsqui	irssi+screen is very, very widely used around here
2014-10-22 23:39:17	relsqui	I can't compare the two because I haven't used vnc
2014-10-22 23:39:22	relsqui	but I've been relying on irssi/screen for years
2014-10-22 23:39:27	relsqui	(way, way longer than I've been a cat)
2014-10-22 23:39:31	relsqui	or a psu student
2014-10-22 23:39:49	taron	yeah this is the first time i've used irc for anything at all
2014-10-22 23:39:51	relsqui	it also bears noting that irssi itself has some options that let you use it as a bouncer, *while* using it normally inside a screen session
2014-10-22 23:40:01	@krinkle	hrm braindump orientation is not tonight
2014-10-22 23:40:05	@krinkle	I need a new topic suggestion
2014-10-22 23:40:13	relsqui	hmm
2014-10-22 23:40:53	taron	i'm personally enjoying not having to remember more passwords and not having to stare at the ugly mess that is mirc
2014-10-22 23:42:35	oscitet	I miss the dos char art sometimes.

2014-10-22 23:43:13	@krinkle	I'm not picky
2014-10-22 23:43:15	taron	if humor, my vote goes for "The night is dark and full of LDAP."

2014-10-22 23:44:24	taron	nearly gave myself a headache trying to make sense of it earlier
2014-10-22 23:45:00	taron	also, in reference to an earlier ARC meeting, "stop trying to make docker happen. it's not going to happen."

2014-10-22 23:54:08	Lazuruz	hmmm...so connecting back to my box at home from somewhere not at home.  Any suggestions? Have VPN but dont like using it for just IRC, also use DNS service but its not very secure (from my understanding at least). Thanks, sorry for hundred questions tonight.
2014-10-22 23:54:29	relsqui	what's your security concern about dns?
2014-10-22 23:56:06	Lazuruz	not sure im correct in saying this, but doesnt it point out the IP and port that one is connecting to, as well as peoples ability to traffic snatch thats on the same network.

2014-10-22 23:57:50	relsqui	hmm. at least one of us doesn't understand what dns does, and I'm not sufficiently confident in my own understanding to assume it's you
2014-10-22 23:58:06	relsqui	which is to say, I have no idea what you're talking about

2014-10-22 23:59:01	apels	wait.. is there a reason to have irc on your box
2014-10-22 23:59:07	Lazuruz	ok, yeah I dont have a real solid understanding of network security so I could be completey off base here.
2014-10-22 23:59:23	Lazuruz	persistant connection
2014-10-22 23:59:28	relsqui	apels's question is also good; unless you're already running a server that you take good care of, there's very little advantage in running it at home
2014-10-22 23:59:36	relsqui	as opposed to running it on a cat server and remoting into it
2014-10-22 23:59:50	@krinkle	dns doesn't work with ports, it's just a mapping of ip address to domain name
2014-10-22 23:59:59	apels	^
2014-10-23 00:00:04	@krinkle	it's not exactly the pinnacle of security but without it the internet wouldn't work
2014-10-23 00:00:06	--	d-_-b is now known as Guest83565
2014-10-23 00:00:13	@krinkle	so i would really worry about using it
2014-10-23 00:00:30	apels	:3
2014-10-23 00:00:31	Lazuruz	I do run my own media server. I kind of wanted to experiment with ZNC

2014-10-23 00:02:12	relsqui	I used a bunch of dynamic dns stuff before I got an actual domain name, heh
2014-10-23 00:02:21	lewisrjc	the big fear with dns (from a consumer side) is that it gives you the wrong IP
2014-10-23 00:02:45	taron	i've forgotten what it's like to not have a domain name
2014-10-23 00:02:58	taron	was impulse buying them for a while
2014-10-23 00:02:59	Lazuruz	lewisrjc: could you explain that, im interested
2014-10-23 00:02:59	apels	i have yet to need one
2014-10-23 00:03:12	apels	>.>
2014-10-23 00:03:20	lewisrjc	if you are VPN/SSl/Whatever'd you don't have to worry about that...assuming the cert chain is valid (which it isn't) but that's getting really fucking tin foil hat
2014-10-23 00:03:22	relsqui	taron: I'm just poor enough not to do that, but yeah
2014-10-23 00:03:32	relsqui	apels: it's nice to have a place to just throw stuff on the internet. plus it's in my canonical email address
2014-10-23 00:03:35	lewisrjc	like, build a valid threat vector before you stop trusting DNS IMO
2014-10-23 00:03:46	Lazuruz	lewisrjc: hahaha ...tinfoil (check)
2014-10-23 00:03:46	relsqui	which in retrospect is idiotic, because imagine giving out relsqui@chiliahedron.com over the phone
2014-10-23 00:03:55	relsqui	"no, it's <ch> ... pronounced [k] ... sorry, it's Greek"
2014-10-23 00:04:00	apels	relsqui: i guess. but i would have to pay for a vps
2014-10-23 00:04:05	relsqui	apels: no you don't!
2014-10-23 00:04:08	oscitet	haha
2014-10-23 00:04:12	apels	b-but..
2014-10-23 00:04:27	relsqui	apels: you could point it at the self-hosted box in your closet if you wanted :P
2014-10-23 00:04:55	lewisrjc	Lazuruz: As Krinkle said all DNS does is map a name to a number (IP address), but how do you know that IP Address is valid
2014-10-23 00:05:02	taron	relsqui: not sure how I did it, cause I definitely didn't have the money either
2014-10-23 00:05:06	relsqui	haha
2014-10-23 00:05:10	apels	b-but i am too paranoid
2014-10-23 00:05:13	lewisrjc	the answer is IP-Sec, which either doesn't exist or isn't used dependingon who you are
2014-10-23 00:05:25	apels	i could use my HP though
2014-10-23 00:05:28	taron	anyway i'm just lazy and don't want to have to actually memorize my vps's ip
2014-10-23 00:05:30	relsqui	Lazuruz: ... besides, if you don't use DNS, you have to use your IP address, which exposes it even more :P
2014-10-23 00:05:30	lewisrjc	apels: you are on the internet
2014-10-23 00:05:32	Lazuruz	Dynamic DNS services have a client app that relays the current IP back to the main DNS servers
2014-10-23 00:05:38	relsqui	that's what DNS is *for*
2014-10-23 00:05:49	apels	lewisrjc: y-y-yea
2014-10-23 00:05:51	relsqui	apels: I mean, parts of my domain also point to a friend's dns
2014-10-23 00:05:55	lewisrjc	relsqui: who are you talking to?
2014-10-23 00:06:05	relsqui	several people?
2014-10-23 00:06:08	apels	:3
2014-10-23 00:06:09	relsqui	I try to address them as needed to disambiguate
2014-10-23 00:06:10	Lazuruz	resqui: exposure is my concern as well
2014-10-23 00:06:14	relsqui	:P
2014-10-23 00:06:18	lewisrjc	I am getting confused with these conversations
2014-10-23 00:06:21	taron	that and i do web dev for an eve alliance and there is an incredible number of eve players out there who can figure out the game but don't know what an ip address is or how to put it in their browser when i tell them to
2014-10-23 00:06:22	lewisrjc	relsqui: good answer
2014-10-23 00:06:32	relsqui	apels: e.g. http://peeron.chiliahedron.com == http://carabiner.peeron.com/~relsqui because I'm too lazy to type that shit out
2014-10-23 00:07:04	oscitet	oh, nice
2014-10-23 00:07:16	oscitet	I'll have to try that one relsqui
2014-10-23 00:07:17	lewisrjc	apels: I remember a friend of mine was talking about how he read some redditor going off on how he was too paranoid because he was using a randomized reddit name and a randomized password that he didn't even know and couldn't be recovered
2014-10-23 00:07:35	apels	hmm
2014-10-23 00:07:37	relsqui	i.e. they're using a password manager?
2014-10-23 00:07:43	relsqui	:P
2014-10-23 00:07:46	apels	i don't use.. this place
2014-10-23 00:07:55	apels	i go to 4chin
2014-10-23 00:08:06	 *	relsqui chooses to assume that's not a typo
2014-10-23 00:08:06	lewisrjc	my response was something along the lnes of "what a plebian of security, doesn't he know even the basics of protecting your self from outside intrusion and doxxing"
2014-10-23 00:08:18	apels	uh
2014-10-23 00:08:19	lewisrjc	apels: that's not something a wise man freely admits
2014-10-23 00:08:28	lewisrjc	unless you are talking about /co or /tg
2014-10-23 00:08:32	taron	stay over there, my productivity has never been the same
2014-10-23 00:08:34	lewisrjc	anyways
2014-10-23 00:08:38	apels	i go to /g/ and /d/
2014-10-23 00:08:42	apels	also woman
2014-10-23 00:08:52	lewisrjc	apels: stop while you are behind
2014-10-23 00:08:55	apels	n
2014-10-23 00:09:04	lewisrjc	although to be honest I have no idea what those are
2014-10-23 00:09:07	apels	/d/ has generally decent anons
2014-10-23 00:09:18	apels	and /g/ is consumer technology
2014-10-23 00:09:20	lewisrjc	Lazuruz: so to continue
2014-10-23 00:09:21	apels	:P
2014-10-23 00:09:36	lewisrjc	DNS is a method by which you say "I WANT GOOGLE," 
2014-10-23 00:10:12	lewisrjc	and DNS turns that into googles actual number address (1.2.3.4) the mechanism by which they do this is irrelevant, although quite clever
2014-10-23 00:10:47	lewisrjc	an attack against a DNS server will make it instead of (1.2.3.4) being th address be (4.3.2.1)
2014-10-23 00:11:04	lewisrjc	which is your own server that does nothing but intercept the traffic and then forward it on to the real server
2014-10-23 00:11:35	lewisrjc	so the end user doesn't see anything different but a MITM (Man in the middle, let's call her Evelynn) is not active
2014-10-23 00:11:38	lewisrjc	BUT
2014-10-23 00:12:30	lewisrjc	if you are using SSL certs* two things happen 1) as soon as you hav the 4.3.2.1 the ssl cert will scream at you WTF ARE YOU DOING THIS IS THE WRONG IP ADDY YOU NIMROD! EVELYNN IS ATTCKING BATTLESTATIONS
2014-10-23 00:13:00	Lazuruz	lewisjrc: And to try and counter this I am using SSL on my current pages like Owncloud
2014-10-23 00:13:10	@krinkle	that is almost exactly the message that chrome gives you when that happens
2014-10-23 00:13:22	lewisrjc	and then because odds are it's actually just a self signed certificate
2014-10-23 00:13:24	relsqui	krinkle++
2014-10-23 00:13:35	Lazuruz	lewisjrc: yeah chrome freaks out cause I dont have the certs on both client and host
2014-10-23 00:14:38	lewisrjc	you click "no, really, I just don't buy into the artificial nature of Verisigns fabricated empire, it's probably chill."
2014-10-23 00:15:05	lewisrjc	krinkle: I am 3 beers in and I haven't read the DNS poisoning attacks in years, if I am getting this wrong please correct me
2014-10-23 00:15:26	lewisrjc	so the other thing that SSL does is encrypt your info.
2014-10-23 00:15:33	@krinkle	iirc there are a number of ways to do it, but that's the general idea
2014-10-23 00:15:36	lewisrjc	This is where the authentication gets important
2014-10-23 00:15:36	Lazuruz	lewisrjc: I am no beers in which a huge problem...(looking for a solution now)
2014-10-23 00:16:15	lewisrjc	so you open your SSL connection and everything is so secure the NSA can't even hack it (no joke, they actually can't)
2014-10-23 00:16:18	lewisrjc	BUT

2014-10-23 13:24:49	Slim	haha that's funny i had this interview question asked during my PCEP interviews from one of the companies
2014-10-23 13:25:34	Slim	omg this repo is hell
2014-10-23 13:26:23	Slim	I have actually seen something very similar to this in company code
2014-10-23 13:26:23	Slim		public String getReturnString() {
2014-10-23 13:26:23	Slim			final StringBuilder myStringBuilder = new StringBuilder("Buzz");
2014-10-23 13:26:23	Slim			final String myString = myStringBuilder.toString();
2014-10-23 13:26:23	Slim			return new String(myString);
2014-10-23 13:26:26	Slim		}
2014-10-23 13:27:12	Slim	except for one of the engineers created a class derived from StringBuilder called NewStringBuilder because it didn't do something he wanted

2014-10-23 13:53:09	alevar	fizzbuzz: surprisingly useful
2014-10-23 13:53:34	alevar	It managed to quickly weed out a candidate at UTi that got to the interview stage.

2014-10-23 13:57:02	b	wow
2014-10-23 13:57:15	b	i had to fizzbuzz for a job once
2014-10-23 13:57:29	b	i totally murdered it.... except for 1 crucial piece
2014-10-23 13:57:47	b	i forgot to output the number in the case of it not being a multiple of 3 or 5
2014-10-23 13:58:18	b	luckily, it was a student job, and they overlooked that minor mistake
2014-10-23 14:10:53	alevar	meh
2014-10-23 14:11:34	alevar	It's not that important that the person get it entirely correct, though they should be able to figure out how to fix a mistake that's pointed out to them.
2014-10-23 14:12:25	b	yeah
2014-10-23 14:12:28	alevar	YMMV
2014-10-23 14:12:52	b	one of the interviewers said "You didn't show the number, normally"
2014-10-23 14:13:11	b	so I threw an else on the end of the conditional block that did it
2014-10-23 14:13:18	b	then i got the job
2014-10-23 14:14:15	alevar	nUbee: So... about that recursive capital/lowercase :)
2014-10-23 14:15:26	pilgrimd	alevar++
2014-10-23 14:15:39	alevar	nUbee++
2014-10-23 14:16:47	alevar	He answered an interview question that was given to him (make every third letter of a string uppercase, everything else lower case) as both iterative and recursive.
2014-10-23 14:16:59	pilgrimd	alevar: I was ++'ing for using FizzBuzz. I have no idea about that for which you're pinging nUbee.
2014-10-23 14:17:19	alevar	ah
2014-10-23 14:17:41	pilgrimd	Interesting problem (the capitalization one).  Do we get to assume ASCII and Latin?
2014-10-23 14:18:06	alevar	If you want to.
2014-10-23 14:18:17	pilgrimd	Because if you say unicode and any cased alphabet, I'm gonna need more beer first.
2014-10-23 14:18:21	alevar	yeah
2014-10-23 14:18:26	alevar	Unless!
2014-10-23 14:19:35	alevar	string.chars().enumerate().map(|i, c| if i % 3 == 0 { c.uppercase() } else { c.lowercase() }).collect::<String>();
2014-10-23 14:19:38	alevar	Rust^
2014-10-23 14:20:16	pilgrimd	heh.
2014-10-23 14:20:25	pilgrimd	Well, sure, cheat and use a modern language.
2014-10-23 14:20:36	alevar	I maybe have gotten uppercase() and lowercase() misspelled.
2014-10-23 14:23:00	pilgrimd	well, if my brain is working right today, a recursive soluton to that problem is kind of nifty.  Do I get bonus points for making it tail recursive?
2014-10-23 14:23:23	alevar	Yes
2014-10-23 14:23:38	pilgrimd	sweet.
2014-10-23 14:24:05	alevar	And extra extra points for making  it Unicode-compatible!
2014-10-23 14:24:14	lewisrjc	alevar: I personally don't like the noun/verb abstraction
2014-10-23 14:24:20	lewisrjc	it's too human
2014-10-23 14:24:45	alevar	lewisrjc: Yeah, that's a problem too.
2014-10-23 14:25:09	lewisrjc	objects are just data, could be actions as well
2014-10-23 14:25:11	lewisrjc	i.e. thunks
2014-10-23 14:26:04	lewisrjc	the discrepency between functional programming and object oriented programing from my perspective is getting less and less
2014-10-23 14:26:36	lewisrjc	STATE!
2014-10-23 14:26:41	lewisrjc	objects are state
2014-10-23 14:26:45	alevar	Yeah
2014-10-23 14:27:12	alevar	I'm having trouble decomposing any of this into state.
2014-10-23 14:27:31	lewisrjc	as a result I view methods as (should) being pure
2014-10-23 14:28:08	 *	alevar is not even going to go there.
2014-10-23 14:28:59	lewisrjc	haha
2014-10-23 14:29:00	alevar	As in, there are precious few people here who are comfortable with the required style.
2014-10-23 14:29:44	lewisrjc	makes sense
2014-10-23 14:30:00	lewisrjc	just make sure your methods preserve the invariants of the object :)
2014-10-23 14:30:32	alevar	There are a few of things that rattboi and I are writing that might be confusing to anyone who's not used to certain styles.
2014-10-23 14:30:58	alevar	e.g. taking full advantage of closures
2014-10-23 14:32:29	lewisrjc	what language?
2014-10-23 14:32:34	alevar	Groovy
2014-10-23 14:32:41	alevar	karmabot: Groovy
2014-10-23 14:32:41	karmabot	groovy(0): worst of ruby and java combined
2014-10-23 14:32:46	alevar	^ truth ^
2014-10-23 14:32:55	alevar	Not my comment
2014-10-23 14:48:48	zacharyp	my comment 
2014-10-23 14:49:19	zacharyp	I get to use gradle now, it is horrible
2014-10-23 14:51:28	alevar	We're kinda sorta using Gradle here.
2014-10-23 14:51:37	alevar	It's more Gradle as an entry point.
2014-10-23 14:52:38	alevar	It's replacing our horrible abuse of Ant, so I'll not complain too loudly.
2014-10-23 14:54:26	stormcrow	alevar: Ant (the person on IRC) is going to see that ping and be very confused
2014-10-23 14:54:55	alevar	stormcrow: Depends on the client
2014-10-23 14:55:33	alevar	irssi only highlights when the line begins with your nick
2014-10-23 14:55:43	 *	alevar prefers that behavior
2014-10-23 15:02:43	relsqui	by default, anyway :)
2014-10-23 15:10:19	pilgrimd	But this format is more natural, alevar.
2014-10-23 15:10:22	pilgrimd	;)
2014-10-23 15:25:30	greghaynes	when did that topic happen
2014-10-23 15:26:25	greghaynes	zacharyp: hows the destiny coming
2014-10-23 15:29:26	zacharyp	level 25 on xbone
2014-10-23 15:29:27	zacharyp	;)
2014-10-23 15:30:08	greghaynes	not bad
2014-10-23 15:30:19	greghaynes	gotta do vog
2014-10-23 15:30:23	greghaynes	it is by far the best content
2014-10-23 15:30:39	zacharyp	so I hear
2014-10-23 15:30:47	greghaynes	by the end I was starting to get less into the game because in reality theres not a ton of content... but vog changed this
2014-10-23 15:31:23	greghaynes	if only there was a sane way to find groups to go and do that sort of thing
2014-10-23 15:50:28	zacharyp	yes, the lack of sane communication in the game itself is pretty braindead
2014-10-23 15:50:48	zacharyp	that people are using IRC or websites or forums just to find other people to play with
2014-10-23 15:51:38	clarkb	zacharyp: that is a common issue
2014-10-23 15:52:58	zacharyp	well, this is a game where you can already interact with people in the game
2014-10-23 15:53:30	zacharyp	and by interact, I mean 'point at', 'wave at', and 'dance with'.  Period, that's it
2014-10-23 15:54:36	greghaynes	Also a lot of the game is designed in a way which requires you to find a group to play with
2014-10-23 15:55:14	greghaynes	there is a way in ps4 at least you can invite people into a party from in game
2014-10-23 15:55:17	greghaynes	but still
2014-10-23 15:55:24	zacharyp	it's the same in xbone
2014-10-23 16:20:36	taron	ffff head of it for my eve corp just now discovered SSDs
2014-10-23 16:21:30	taron	not sure if overly conservative or just living under a rock

2014-10-24 10:31:35	clarkb	kini: you can use that hack to make pcitures on github activity graphs
2014-10-24 10:31:48	kini	lol
2014-10-24 10:31:49	kini	link?

2014-10-24 10:35:25	kini	hmm, seems they didn't succeed in drawing a picture in their activity graph though
2014-10-24 10:35:48	kini	anyway I wasn't pointing out the fact that the commit date was spoofed, but the combination of that and the commit message
2014-10-24 10:36:00	clarkb	kini: it may have shifted
2014-10-24 10:36:07	clarkb	you only get a one yaer window
2014-10-24 10:36:26	kini	but the readme says he only started this in february 2014 or something
2014-10-24 10:37:19	clarkb	there are examples if you go looking
2014-10-24 10:37:31	clarkb	I don't actually github much so am not up with the latest in super hip github hacks
2014-10-24 10:45:55	dondon	yeah I think the one kini links to was just an accident. BTW, how does one go about fixing metadata of an old commit? gc --amend only affect the current one
2014-10-24 10:46:34	kini	you'll have to rewrite everything from that commit on downward
2014-10-24 10:46:43	whopper	other than just checking out the old commit and commit commit --amending?
2014-10-24 10:46:48	kini	do git rebase -i <commit id>~1
2014-10-24 10:47:14	kini	deselect everything except the commit you want to change, and say you want to edit that
2014-10-24 10:47:29	kini	then when you're dropped back into the terminal, do git commit with the appropriate options for setting authoring and committing date
2014-10-24 10:47:36	kini	or whatever other metadata you want to change
2014-10-24 10:47:44	kini	then git rebase --continue
2014-10-24 10:47:47	kini	that should do it
2014-10-24 10:51:47	clarkb	this will rewrite all the history
2014-10-24 10:52:37	clarkb	dondon: also gc command not found :P
2014-10-24 10:56:21	dondon	clarkb: aww come on, you haven't "alias gc='git commit'" yet?
2014-10-24 10:56:33	clarkb	dondon: no I avoid aliases
2014-10-24 10:56:47	clarkb	I end up on far too many machines to have super custom crap everywhere
2014-10-24 10:57:08	alevar	dondon: I prefer to have it "alias gc='rm -rf .git'", but to each their own.

2014-10-24 11:00:07	clarkb	dondon: also I have people proposing code in scripts or utilities that exec and they put their aliases in the commands
2014-10-24 11:00:14	clarkb	dondon: so I basically think aliases should diaf
2014-10-24 11:00:42	clarkb	(seriously had someone propose something just like `EDITOR=true gc --amend` in a git utility script
2014-10-24 11:04:03	alevar	set AS "a"; set IS "i"; while true; echo br{$AS}{$IS}ns; set AS a$AS; set IS i$IS;sleep 1s; end

2014-10-24 11:12:08	dondon	clarkb: yeah, sorry, I don't actually have any aliases for git, was just saving some typing >.>
2014-10-24 11:13:17	zacharyp	typing is easy compared to making sure your aliases are available on every virtual instance that comes up that you might log into
2014-10-24 11:13:33	 *	zacharyp logs into virtual instances all day long
2014-10-24 11:13:45	clarkb	zacharyp: o/
2014-10-24 11:13:52	zacharyp	\o
2014-10-24 11:14:08	clarkb	seriously though we boot upwards of 25k instances per day
2014-10-24 11:14:22	clarkb	ain't nobody got time for mapping local to prod dev stuff
2014-10-24 11:17:01	clarkb	karmabot: (working from home) is leftovers must be consumed
2014-10-24 11:17:01	karmabot	OK, clarkb.
2014-10-24 11:33:22	zacharyp	sigh, I want to work from home
2014-10-24 11:36:07	clarkb	zacharyp: you can pretend and join us at pints for happy hour today
2014-10-24 11:46:31	kini	<dondon> whopper: that leaves you in detached HEAD, because it is what I tried >.>
2014-10-24 11:46:31	kini	if you get into that state, just check out the branch you were on and then do `git rebase <former-detached-head-commit-id>`
2014-10-24 11:46:38	kini	that should be what you want
2014-10-24 11:46:55	kini	I guess that's easier than my suggestion to do an interactive rebase
2014-10-24 11:47:25	clarkb	kini: rebase is nice because you don't have to construct the pointers yourself
2014-10-24 11:47:30	clarkb	you just do it
2014-10-24 11:47:38	kini	yup
2014-10-24 11:47:45	kini	well, and reparent everything too
2014-10-24 11:47:54	kini	or maybe that's what you meant by pointers
2014-10-24 11:53:38	clarkb	ya
2014-10-24 11:53:54	clarkb	you have to remember where things are to rearrange. whereas with rebase you just sa move over there and it handles intermediate state

2014-10-24 21:38:55	eli	I mean, I use both tmux and screen, but for different purposes. But tmux seems to do what screen does but... better...

2014-10-25 13:57:00	kini	note also that linux is not unix
2014-10-25 13:57:56	kini	and even if it were, many actual unix operating systems have something similar to systemd anyway so it's not true that unix tries not to be systemd
2014-10-25 13:58:29	kini	such as launchd on mac, smf on solaris
2014-10-25 13:58:31	Corbin	Actual UNIX has rc or sysvinit.

2014-10-25 14:01:35	Corbin	Let me rephrase. The idea that "no *true* UNIX goes without a systemd-like daemon" is not well-founded.
2014-10-25 14:01:49	kini	I didn't say that
2014-10-25 14:01:57	kini	I said many unices have a systemd-like daemon
2014-10-25 14:03:10	Corbin	You said "it's not true that unix tries not to be systemd". It is, however, clearly against the UNIX philosophy to build such a thing and expect it to be universal, and many actual UNIX distributions do not have systemd or systemd-alikes.
2014-10-25 14:03:38	kini	nothing can be clearly for or against the "unix philosophy" because it's such a vague and subjectively defined concept
2014-10-25 14:03:56	kini	also I don't "expect systemd to be universal" and neither does lennart
2014-10-25 14:04:37	Corbin	Then can we have udev be split from the systemd tree?
2014-10-25 14:04:57	Corbin	Since devfs is both bad and dead, udev is essential to making hotplug work.
2014-10-25 14:04:58	kini	uh, yes? fork it? in fact, gentoo already did that
2014-10-25 14:05:01	kini	check out eudev
2014-10-25 14:05:27	Corbin	I'm pointing out that the merger of udev into systemd was done in order to ensure systemd's universality.
2014-10-25 14:05:38	kini	no, no it wasn't
2014-10-25 14:05:40	Corbin	Can't have modern Linux without udev; can't have udev without systemd.
2014-10-25 14:07:13	Corbin	Kay points out that they will support building udev without systemd for "a long time". While I'd love to believe that a RH dev's idea of "a long time" is centuries, it's likely more like two or three years.
2014-10-25 14:07:15	Corbin	https://lwn.net/Articles/490413/
2014-10-25 14:07:16	link-bot	Udev and systemd to merge [LWN.net] (http://goo.gl/e61tRF)
2014-10-25 14:08:05	Corbin	Consider another RH effort, kernel modesetting, which I supported on the basis that kernel drivers really should be able to initialize their hardware to the point where kernel framebuffers and kernel consoles are directly usable.
2014-10-25 14:08:37	Corbin	KMS was supposed to slowly replace UMS in order to keep BSD and other systems with UMS + graphics acceleration able to share code for several decades.
2014-10-25 14:08:52	Corbin	Actual time until a driver maintainer broke compatibility: Two kernel releases.
2014-10-25 14:09:07	kini	whose fault is that?
2014-10-25 14:09:44	Corbin	Everybody's fault. The only people arguing against it were BSD, and BSD doesn't get much mindshare in the Linux community.
2014-10-25 14:09:58	kini	well then.
2014-10-25 14:10:05	Corbin	Today we're not talking about BSD-Linux compatibility, but Linux-Linux (cross-distro) compatibility.
2014-10-25 14:10:11	kini	sounds to me like the problem here is that nobody cares about bsd and bsd is unhappy about this fact
2014-10-25 14:10:56	kini	that is subtly, but importantly, different from people trying to kill bsd or "make non-bsd universal"
2014-10-25 14:11:05	kini	and the same is true of linux-linux cross-distro compatibility
2014-10-25 14:12:00	 *	Corbin shrugs
2014-10-25 14:12:26	kini	btw, speaking of bsd, I'm going to be installing freebsd for the first time pretty soon
2014-10-25 14:12:30	kini	which should be exciting
2014-10-25 14:12:53	kini	maybe after running a freebsd system for a while I'll be more sympathetic to systemd haters, but somehow I doubt it
2014-10-25 14:16:50	 *	clarkb must point out rhel6 uses upstart
2014-10-25 14:17:02	kini	anyway, I think the results more or less speak for themselves. A lot of major distros have adopted it and the world didn't end, and in fact a lot of people (who were ambivalent or didn't care before getting systemd thrust upon them) seem to like it
2014-10-25 14:17:02	kini	those who don't either move to slackware or gentoo or something, or leave linux entirely for the BSDs, or dedicate their lives to sending dumb spam mails to mailing lists
2014-10-25 14:17:09	clarkb	upstart died not for technical reasons
2014-10-25 14:17:27	clarkb	mark slapped a cla on the thing that was suicide
2014-10-25 14:17:46	kini	actually, the more I think about it, the more I start to see parallels to GamerGate lol
2014-10-25 14:17:54	kini	there's even anti-systemd death threats -- http://ix.io/aMo
2014-10-25 14:18:22	clarkb	but we should also remember systemd isnt aninit system
2014-10-25 14:18:25	qnix	systemd is a trojan because it has too much concentrated power.
2014-10-25 14:18:28	kini	systemd is a bunch of stuff
2014-10-25 14:18:31	Corbin	GamerGate is a pair of false-flag operations designed to get people angry. The systemd discussion is between highly-technical people and hinges almost entirely on technical merits.
2014-10-25 14:18:40	kini	lolllll
2014-10-25 14:18:54	clarkb	so comparisons to upstart and openrc and sysv init are only a small part of the picture
2014-10-25 14:19:31	kini	that's true
2014-10-25 14:19:39	kini	man, I wish I could find that article I'm remembering
2014-10-25 14:20:10	clarkb	that said I will continue to write sysv init scripts and log to files
2014-10-25 14:20:31	kini	someone wrote an article about some kind of standardization effort -- was it OAuth2? maybe? -- but the interesting part of the article was how they spent a few paragraphs articulating an (IMO) important point about how the crystallization of lower layers of a toolchain stack enables innovation on a higher level of the system
2014-10-25 14:20:34	clarkb	regardless of systemd install
2014-10-25 14:21:18	kini	the article wasn't saying anything about systemd, but I think it applies -- this is a time in linux history in which the kind of stuff that systemd does is being sort of "standardized" (though again, the systemd people are certainly not forcing this to happen, it's just the distros and developers who are bandwagoning on it)
2014-10-25 14:21:39	kini	which should lead to better times in terms of what lies above systemd on the stack, I would hope
2014-10-25 14:22:10	kini	clarkb: and that's certainly your right, and IMO that's a good thing to do, and I doubt anyone would disagree with that
2014-10-25 14:22:50	kini	it's also similarly good to port your linux software to windows and mac if you have the ability and time and are charitable enough to do so
2014-10-25 14:23:06	kini	but I don't fault developers for depending on systemd stuff when they feel like they have to
2014-10-25 14:23:22	kini	of course, that's a pretty bad analogy
2014-10-25 14:23:39	kini	because like 99% of software would be much much easier to make not depend on systemd than to port to windows
2014-10-25 14:23:52	kini	but then, that's why 99% of software doesn't depend on systemd anyway

2014-10-25 15:56:03	pilgrimd	I'd be fine with systemd if it wasn't being pushed by devs who insist it needs to effectively be a close ecosystem.  Systemd can be a good thing, but its current multi-layer monolithic design model horrifies me and is precisely one of the THE reasons Linux desktops even came into existence.
2014-10-25 15:57:11	pilgrimd	i.e., at the time, Sun, SGI, Microsoft, Apple, etc. were the only games in town for desktops/workstations and you HAD to do it THEIR way or you didn't get to do it at all (sound familiar to anyone?)
2014-10-25 15:57:47	--	One is now known as Zero
2014-10-25 15:59:12	pilgrimd	History has proven that closed-ecosystem *nix development fails unless you have a huge economic advantage that let's ride out the failure and still be around when your enemies are dead.
2014-10-25 15:59:57	pilgrimd	The problem for systemd is, they don't have that.  Linux has been very good at giving people choice and that's precisely what you need your enemies to not have if you want to win this kind of combat.
2014-10-25 16:03:08	pilgrimd	And if you want even more historical references: systemd is a cathedral. Linux doesn't do cathedrals.
2014-10-25 16:08:26	nibalizer	pilgrimd: uh nothing formal
2014-10-25 16:08:31	nibalizer	but if we can meet up we can sign

2014-10-25 16:10:03	pilgrimd	nibalizer: OOC, why the sudden interest in GPG?
2014-10-25 16:10:19	nibalizer	idunno i go through cycles where i try to get gpg trust
2014-10-25 16:10:23	nibalizer	then i give up for a while
2014-10-25 16:10:27	nibalizer	then cycle again
2014-10-25 16:10:29	nibalizer	then give up
2014-10-25 16:10:30	pilgrimd	sounds familiar. :)
2014-10-25 16:12:50	pilgrimd	I had PGP for years, then GPG.  Incidentally, because of PGP's meaning, I'm convinced means "Good Privacy is Good".  I went to lots of PGP signings, had it on servers, lost the keys, then started again a few years later.
2014-10-25 16:13:16	pilgrimd	My homework floppies where PGP-encrypted disks.

2014-10-26 22:09:52	kini	there's also an ancient TCP protocol which basically requires you to sync their entire database over the wire before you do anything, or something

2014-10-26 22:15:15	Corbin	Yeah. I once looked into cracking open their client and copying their DB, but never finished it.
2014-10-26 22:18:46	kini	AOM doesn't even sync the database anymore since the schema has changed drastically since it was last updated
2014-10-26 22:18:54	kini	so that would be partially pointless
2014-10-26 22:19:07	kini	it syncs some subset of the database that still exists for backwards compatibility, or something
2014-10-26 22:35:55	Corbin	Yeah. :T
2014-10-26 22:36:42	Corbin	I remember talking to them over half a decade ago about all of this. Their response was that UDP is very reliable, the database is their property and shouldn't be sync'd, and if I'm asking all these questions then clearly I'm trying to steal the database and make my own site.

2014-10-27 20:00:11	clarkb	and if a book can hold up to that then its not terrible
2014-10-27 20:00:19	 *	dondon had no book; three profs
2014-10-27 20:00:31	clarkb	we had a book, it was bad, I think I might have bruned it
2014-10-27 20:00:37	ryan	dondon: two and a half. :P
2014-10-27 20:01:10	dondon	ryan: li-- is not a prof, it is true
2014-10-27 20:01:30	lewisrjc	hein is not a good book. It's an okay book
2014-10-27 20:01:33	ryan	I wasn't gonna name names... :)
2014-10-27 20:01:43	clarkb	but I had hein for 250,251,311,321,322
2014-10-27 20:01:50	lewisrjc	PROLOG!
2014-10-27 20:02:01	clarkb	lewisrjc: that prolog was good for me
2014-10-27 20:02:08	clarkb	damn gerrit and its prolog engine
2014-10-27 20:02:18	lewisrjc	but did you write it tail call recursive?
2014-10-27 20:02:22	lewisrjc	you are shitting me
2014-10-27 20:02:28	lewisrjc	tell you me you pulling my leg
2014-10-27 20:02:33	clarkb	oh I don't remember any of the prolog I wrote
2014-10-27 20:02:38	clarkb	I am sure it was terrible
2014-10-27 20:02:42	clarkb	but exposure to it was good
2014-10-27 20:03:07	lewisrjc	yeah I can see that argument, but haskell or curry would've sifficed and b a bit more reasonable
2014-10-27 20:03:20	clarkb	they are different though
2014-10-27 20:03:26	clarkb	not different bad
2014-10-27 20:03:33	clarkb	just different and I ended up haskelling in other courses
2014-10-27 20:03:36	lewisrjc	curry's pretty damn similar
2014-10-27 20:03:58	lewisrjc	except it's lazily evaluated, has a type system and doesn't have negation as failure
2014-10-27 20:04:33	clarkb	No
2014-10-27 20:04:54	ryan	what language did York use for CS350? /me didn't even remember the name.
2014-10-27 20:05:02	clarkb	calculus
2014-10-27 20:05:05	ryan	heh
2014-10-27 20:05:06	VanHelsing	lolol
2014-10-27 20:05:07	ryan	right
2014-10-27 20:05:59	clarkb	(I didn't program in Yorks 350 course, some programming would have been nice to model stuff)
2014-10-27 20:06:06	clarkb	we wrote mosml in 311
2014-10-27 20:06:18	lewisrjc	seriously?
2014-10-27 20:06:24	lewisrjc	that's why we have that installed
2014-10-27 20:06:27	lewisrjc	good language
2014-10-27 20:06:33	clarkb	had a non deterministic finite automata to deterministic finite automata converter program
2014-10-27 20:06:36	clarkb	it was super slow
2014-10-27 20:06:43	clarkb	I wrote bad mosml but it worked damnit
2014-10-27 20:06:57	lewisrjc	yeah, MLTon is where it'sat
2014-10-27 20:07:18	lewisrjc	super fast ML code (also actually reasonably standards compliant
2014-10-27 20:07:19	dondon	york is doing C now, was prolog
2014-10-27 20:07:47	ryan	dondon, instead of retiring he switched to C?
2014-10-27 20:07:54	ryan	... refer to my statement in person earlier.
2014-10-27 20:08:05	dondon	york is eternal
2014-10-27 20:08:15	ryan	anyways, thought it was prolog. interesting.
2014-10-27 20:08:43	ryan	yeah, I'm wondering if the whole retirement thing he kept mentioning was his own brand of sarcasm at this point.
2014-10-27 20:08:51	dondon	ryan: he switched this term, I think
2014-10-27 20:09:00	ryan	dondon: what do you mean?
2014-10-27 20:09:02	clarkb	you don't simply just retire
2014-10-27 20:09:04	clarkb	see hein
2014-10-27 20:09:07	clarkb	or czanky
2014-10-27 20:09:09	dondon	ryan: languages
2014-10-27 20:09:20	clarkb	laslo is fun would also take course from him again
2014-10-27 20:09:28	dondon	context-- can't have any
2014-10-27 20:09:37	ryan	ahhh
2014-10-27 20:10:40	clarkb	isn't shapiro still around too?
2014-10-27 20:11:39	dondon	heh, black wants the capstone team to fix his grace debugger, and write a REPL
2014-10-27 20:12:17	ryan	REPL's are usually pretty easy, really.
2014-10-27 20:12:51	dondon	among other things
2014-10-27 20:13:06	dondon	and an audio library, right
2014-10-27 20:13:09	ryan	heh
2014-10-27 20:13:28	ryan	might as well just throw in some complete HTML5 bindings, right?
2014-10-27 20:13:51	dondon	so he wants a server-code-repo
2014-10-27 20:13:53	joshproehl	dondon: How much NOPE is gonig on on your team right now? 
2014-10-27 20:13:55	joshproehl	:-D
2014-10-27 20:14:15	joshproehl	these capstone presentations are making me regret everything that led me to this point...
2014-10-27 20:14:22	ryan	joshproehl: how so?
2014-10-27 20:14:26	ryan	out of curiousity..
2014-10-27 20:14:35	joshproehl	"Go back to school" they said.. "You'll learn things you didn't learn in industry..." they said..
2014-10-27 20:14:40	lewisrjc	joshproehl: grace isn't that bad, but that's not a full team project
2014-10-27 20:15:10	ryan	joshproehl: it has certainly been an eye opener to me. just think, 1 in a 1000 of these ideas might accidently make it in the real world somehow, and I think that explains a lot about the world we live in. :P
2014-10-27 20:15:24	joshproehl	I'm sort of morally opposed to the IDEA of grace, to begin with..
2014-10-27 20:15:30	lewisrjc	?
2014-10-27 20:15:31	ryan	heh
2014-10-27 20:15:33	lewisrjc	why?
2014-10-27 20:15:44	ryan	ask CS tutors about Karla's language.
2014-10-27 20:15:46	joshproehl	heh
2014-10-27 20:15:50	lewisrjc	it's yet another smalltalk derivitive for education
2014-10-27 20:15:50	joshproehl	believe me, opposed to that too.
2014-10-27 20:15:57	lewisrjc	Karla's language?
2014-10-27 20:16:30	joshproehl	the *only* point that I can see is to minimize the available library of code to copy from.
2014-10-27 20:16:52	lewisrjc	ehhh that wouldn't actually happen
2014-10-27 20:16:56	clarkb	hrm I should really figure out how to do non sucky capstone projects
2014-10-27 20:16:59	joshproehl	Good for professors does not make good for students.
2014-10-27 20:17:04	clarkb	but I only just moved back to portland

2014-10-27 20:17:32	ryan	lewisrjc, I'm not sure what it was, but she was teaching some teaching-only language instead of C++ lately, and it seems like the students were not benefiting from that.
2014-10-27 20:17:48	clarkb	ryan: really?
2014-10-27 20:17:57	ryan	it sounded like they were having more trouble, and it is less applicable to the real world.
2014-10-27 20:17:59	clarkb	seems odd for karlaf to not be using C++
2014-10-27 20:18:07	 *	joshproehl thinks that "Karla" would have been a much better name than "Grace" anyway...
2014-10-27 20:18:16	ryan	heh

2014-10-27 20:18:57	diprosopus	Hi
2014-10-27 20:19:42	joshproehl	I still think Karla would have been more appropriate, since it's designed to be super intro-to-programming
2014-10-27 20:19:44	joshproehl	:-D
2014-10-27 20:20:06	clarkb	161 is taught in python now and I think 16X are still C++
2014-10-27 20:20:12	dondon	joshproehl: it is not just a PSU project, supposedly

2014-10-27 20:21:13	dondon	yeah, black didn't mention the other uni's name in his presentation right now

2014-10-27 22:33:55	ryan	I'm kind of scared of InfluxDB and such. I lack complete understanding.
2014-10-27 22:34:07	dondon	ryan: time-series databasing is a current industry-research topic, the folks at pdxdevops are working on. since a large web service gathers much more data faster than the BPA does

2014-11-02 11:07:01	pilgrimd	Krampus: You glorious bastard, you. Also, bonus points for a bathroom that smells awesome.
2014-11-02 11:12:38	Krampus	It's my way of striking back against the prolification of flower-scented poofery in the bathing area.
2014-11-02 11:12:43	vjones	has anyone done Functional Reactive Programming? It looks interesting: https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754/
2014-11-02 11:12:46	link-bot	The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing (http://goo.gl/qjvn7M)
2014-11-02 11:13:17	Krampus	Men didn't start this war, but by god we will finish it with mutually assured beefstruction.
2014-11-02 11:16:19	Krampus	vjones: ...mother of god...  The existance of this concept must never be shared.
2014-11-02 11:20:38	vjones	so, this is pretty similar to how the classic GUI event model works, so... there's that. But I feel that making the system more generic, so many things can be streams, opens up a lot of interesting possibilities
2014-11-02 11:21:59	vjones	so you can say, "whenever X changes, I want Y to happen", where X and Y are pretty arbitrary
2014-11-02 11:22:28	Krampus	vjones: yeah, it looks very interesting.  However, I forsee great horrors of code arising from it.
2014-11-02 11:22:51	Krampus	vjones: "I have a new tool!  Therefore I must use it for EVERYTHING!"
2014-11-02 11:23:03	 *	Krampus is still in the midst of cleaning up after a 'clever' fuckwit.
2014-11-02 11:24:12	Krampus	vjones: I bet that could fit well into a real time system, like for example a car's ECU.
2014-11-02 11:24:15	vjones	at least you can clean up after him
2014-11-02 11:24:22	vjones	you can't clean up a system that uses OO
2014-11-02 11:24:56	vjones	any system that can be better modeled as a series of events in time would benefit from this
2014-11-02 11:25:12	Krampus	vjones: oh, that's the fun part.  He's spent most of the year designing "the great solution" for a problem that doesn't really exist.  I took one look at the code and was like "Uh... you don't understand the point of object oriented programming..."
2014-11-02 11:25:12	vjones	as opposed, for example, to a system that can be modeled as a series of objects that act on each other
2014-11-02 11:25:32	vjones	oh yeah, the Java way of doing OO
2014-11-02 11:26:29	Krampus	vjones: The documentation for it is like "It's written in object oriented C++.  It is a true object oriented highly modular application/library stack not a C program masquerading as C++.  Inheritance and abstraction are used to good effect.  Code and data live together, No global variables are utilized."
2014-11-02 11:26:46	vjones	that's the documentation?
2014-11-02 11:26:53	vjones	that's awful
2014-11-02 11:27:08	Krampus	more of the self-serving advertisement he put in it.
2014-11-02 11:28:15	vjones	I think that classes are used way too much in code, and that the concepts added in C++11 help to solve that problem
2014-11-02 11:29:20	vjones	There are definitely times that you want to build an inheritance hierarchy. There's no goddamn excuse for making an inheritance hierarchy 6 layers deep
2014-11-02 11:30:28	Krampus	Earlier in the year, I provided him a design for a module to interact with a piece of hardware.  I had designed it specifically for something else I was working on, but it was pretty straightforward to use.  Basically "Load this data to that hardware" "Start hardware"  "Reset."  Only three methods provided.  Under the hood, derived classes implemented the hardware-specific methods.  I think I had a factory class that you gave a device
2014-11-02 11:30:58	vjones	makes sense
2014-11-02 11:30:59	Krampus	Anyway, he comes back and basically inverted it so there's now separate classes for each version, huge switch statements to select, and "uhh... that's not... how..."
2014-11-02 11:31:06	vjones	nope nope nope
2014-11-02 11:31:23	vjones	big switch statements should be an antipattern
2014-11-02 11:31:41	Krampus	Yeah, if I have to do more than one or two levels of inheritance, I may have made a poor life chocie.
2014-11-02 11:32:39	Krampus	There are exceptions, of course.
2014-11-02 11:32:45	Krampus	but seems like a good generalization.
2014-11-02 11:33:08	vjones	well, I like the idea of interfaces versus implementations
2014-11-02 11:33:26	Krampus	Around April I started looking at his stuff more closely and then went "...oh shit, this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing and at some point snuck a large number of changes into our code base."
2014-11-02 11:33:52	vjones	you've been fixing his code for like, 6 months?
2014-11-02 11:35:25	Krampus	vjones: longer than that.  Mostly small patches to the top layer because I didn't want to go too deep.  I knew I was going to have to rewrite it, but didn't actually hit a bad enough bug to justify starting a full rewrite until last month.
2014-11-02 11:36:06	vjones	the thing I love about OO is that it's supposed to make generic code, but still ends up creating highly coupled code unless you work really, really hard
2014-11-02 11:36:35	Krampus	vjones: he hits pretty much every "signs your a bad programmers" trope.
2014-11-02 11:36:38	vjones	Krampus: so you're rewriting it now?
2014-11-02 11:37:37	Krampus	vjones: yeah, I think we have maybe three or four people in my group (including myself) that actually understand how to properly write OOP code.  And, more importantly, when do to so.
2014-11-02 11:38:20	Krampus	vjones: ayup.  I had kind of started to rewrite the entire thing (not just his) as a side project because it's had a lot of half-assery injected into it over the years.
2014-11-02 11:38:37	Krampus	vjones: but I didn't get a fire under my ass until last month.
2014-11-02 11:40:06	vjones	that really sucks
2014-11-02 11:40:08	Krampus	vjones: the downside is that the project Bogan was working on got canceled.
2014-11-02 11:40:56	-->	CodeRect (CodeRect@10.200.124.242) has joined #cschat
2014-11-02 11:41:36	vjones	I wish they'd teach more OO to CompE's. Every time I see C++ listed on a resume, I think, "yeah, but can you prove to me that you actually know C++, or did you just take CS162 and CS163?"
2014-11-02 11:41:38	Krampus	vjones: eh, everyones opinion that matters is on board with what I'm doing.  It's just a lot of stuff to churn out on top of everything else I need to get done.
2014-11-02 11:41:56	Krampus	vjones: yes, that.  I don't care what you have on your resume if you only took a class on it.
2014-11-02 11:42:25	Krampus	vjones: now if you actually did some projects, preferably on your own and not at school, involving it?  You're interesting.
2014-11-02 11:43:10	vjones	TO ALL STUDENTS: Carefully consider listing C++ on your resume
2014-11-02 11:44:48	vjones	I always enjoy the people that say they know C++ but don't understand inheritance
2014-11-02 11:45:14	vjones	or templates
2014-11-02 11:45:18	vjones	or the STL
2014-11-02 11:45:31	vjones	or C
2014-11-02 11:46:10	vjones	oh man, gotta stop myself before I continue my rant
2014-11-02 11:46:18	Krampus	I "love" people that when told their code is poorly written either throw down with some insinuation that "if you were as smart as me, you'd understand it!" or complain to management that "their contributions aren't appreciated."
2014-11-02 11:48:36	vjones	I wish they'd stop teaching people to use bare 'new' and 'delete' in their code
2014-11-02 11:49:06	vjones	smart pointers are so underused
2014-11-02 11:50:50	Krampus	Hm... I think I'd prefer if they taught them but with a huge list of better options.  There's a lot of "thou shalt not" that leads to cargo cult programming because people don't understand the why.
2014-11-02 11:51:17	Krampus	'goto' is probably the extreme example of a taboo construct.
2014-11-02 11:51:38	vjones	goto has its places
2014-11-02 11:52:00	vjones	it was used way too much back in the day, so people pretty much banned the use of it
2014-11-02 11:52:01	Krampus	There are very valid reasons to use them but I've encountered a lot of supposed software experts who freak out when they see them.
2014-11-02 11:52:28	Krampus	"YOU USED A GOTO!"  "uh... Look at what I'm doing here-" "DOESN'T MATTER YOU USED A GOTO WHARGARBL!"
2014-11-02 11:52:45	vjones	The most compelling reason I've seen for goto is for exception handling
2014-11-02 11:53:11	Krampus	actually, when I say valid reasons, I really can only think of exception handling and cleaning up when things go wrong.
2014-11-02 11:53:28	vjones	I consider both of those exception handling
2014-11-02 11:53:51	Krampus	yeah, I don't know why I'm acting like they're separate.  :)
2014-11-02 11:53:53	vjones	well, 'break' and 'continue' are specializations of goto
2014-11-02 11:54:01	vjones	and those have their place
2014-11-02 11:54:49	Krampus	I will say that 'goto' is one of those things that if I see it in code from certain people, it'll set off hella red flags.
2014-11-02 11:55:13	vjones	definitely
2014-11-02 11:55:26	Krampus	Same with any inline assembly or overriding compiler behaviors in the code (eg, forcing inlines, disabling certain things).
2014-11-02 11:55:37	Krampus	Because you either a) know *exactly* what you're doing or b) have no fucking clude.
2014-11-02 11:56:08	vjones	bare 'new' and especially an explicit 'delete' set off red flags for me
2014-11-02 11:56:28	vjones	that's allocated memory just begging to be leaked
2014-11-02 11:56:54	vjones	with no information on who owns that memory, either
2014-11-02 11:57:05	vjones	or rather, who's in charge of deleting it
2014-11-02 11:57:59	vjones	playing around with the Rust programming language has really helped me see bad uses of new and delete
2014-11-02 11:58:31	Krampus	since I do more C at this point, I see memory allocation/freeing conventions as an architectural problem, not unlike locking schemes.  Not planning before writing code is another red flag.
2014-11-02 11:59:31	Krampus	I fully admit that I have an irrational distrust of automated garbage collection though.
2014-11-02 12:02:08	vjones	the issue is that putting the burden of managing resource allocation and destruction inevitably leads to resource leaks. Nobody is perfect every hour of every day. Something inevitably falls through
2014-11-02 12:03:11	Krampus	I'm also kind of obsessive about running stuff through Valgrind on a regular basis.  When we get our CI system set up, that's going to be one of the things I want in there.
2014-11-02 12:03:26	vjones	which is where stuff like shared_ptr comes in, which clearly marks something as owning a resource, something that's in charge of cleaning up those resources, even when something goes wrong
2014-11-02 12:03:39	Krampus	as far as falling through, the biggest problem we have is a lack of proper code review.
2014-11-02 12:03:51	Krampus	But I've got that on the road to fixed.
2014-11-02 12:03:57	vjones	code reviews don't solve the whole problem
2014-11-02 12:04:31	vjones	even with code reviews, it needs to be obvious who is in charge of freeing the memory, which is not always obvious
2014-11-02 12:04:54	vjones	especially with dynamic memory shared between multiple possible owners (classes, threads, etc)
2014-11-02 12:05:22	Krampus	no, but they'll go a long way.  For that particular area of quality, I saw 1) 'quick fixes' checked in that were forgotten about, 2) bad practices that the committer didn't know was bad, 3) inconsistent review practices.  Some code gets reviewed, others doesn't.
2014-11-02 12:05:38	vjones	yes, code reviews help
2014-11-02 12:05:54	vjones	btw, code collaborator isn't a bad choice. We use that at work, and it's not too bad
2014-11-02 12:06:16	vjones	there are probably better systems, but there are also definitely worse systems
2014-11-02 12:06:33	Krampus	I think #2 especially (along with "Call bullshit when it needs to be called")
2014-11-02 12:06:42	Krampus	and we'll wind up bringing up the skill level of eveyone.
2014-11-02 12:07:04	vjones	yeah, definitely. Something to look out for is to make sure everyone is fully participating
2014-11-02 12:07:20	vjones	don't want code reviews turning into rubber stamps. It's something to always watch out for
2014-11-02 12:07:48	Krampus	We had code collaborator.  In addition to the UI problems (at least for the version we had), we didn't have a good way to have a closed-loop review cycle.  You can flag the shit out of code and unless you babysit the owner, you're not guaranteed its fixed.
2014-11-02 12:08:07	vjones	oh yeah, I've seen that for sure
2014-11-02 12:08:28	Krampus	I forget who suggested it, but Phabricator has been fitting our requirements suprisingly well.
2014-11-02 12:09:19	Krampus	It lets us do both post-commit audits and pre-commit reviews.  But the review doesn't end until the all raised concerns have been fixed and made part of the commit set.
2014-11-02 12:09:31	Krampus	so what gets pushed to the repo is the reviewed and fixed version.
2014-11-02 12:11:48	vjones	that's pretty cool, but... we don't use git
2014-11-02 12:12:24	Krampus	It works with git, Mercurial, and Subversion.  I've only used Git though
2014-11-02 12:13:29	vjones	we don't use any of those
2014-11-02 12:13:46	vjones	but that's cool that you found a good system
2014-11-02 12:13:48	Krampus	Another thing I really like about it is that it's not forcing you to adopt its way of doing things.  You can use as little or as much of it as you want and "however" you want.  Originally I was just using it to audit (post-push) commits.
2014-11-02 12:14:02	Krampus	other dudes in my group are like "lets use this for planning."
2014-11-02 12:14:36	Krampus	so we'll see how it turns out.  If it works, great.  If not, at least we're starting to develop better processes.
2014-11-02 12:14:42	Krampus	what do you guys use for source control?
2014-11-02 12:17:45	vjones	clearcase
2014-11-02 12:18:45	Krampus	my only experience with clearcase was having a dude in another team that used it explain that a bunch of features had "fallen out" of the repository due to daylight savings and timezones or some "...what?" explanation.
2014-11-02 12:19:38	vjones	try to never use it

2014-11-02 23:01:33	vjones	I asked that already
2014-11-02 23:01:34	Krampus	Finding out that your business factory unit is going to be using RTC is like gaining confirmation that great gam gam was, in fact, a whore.
2014-11-02 23:02:28	vjones	I always like when nameless talks about the shit he's seen with svn
2014-11-02 23:02:53	Krampus	switching from svn to git was like... amazeballs.
2014-11-02 23:03:37	vjones	git is amazing
2014-11-02 23:03:55	vjones	you really get a feel for that when you start using older version control systems
2014-11-02 23:04:16	vjones	git just did so many things right where so many others had done it wrong
2014-11-02 23:04:20	Krampus	yep.
2014-11-02 23:04:58	vjones	and really, compared to other VCS's, git is so stupidly easy to use
2014-11-02 23:05:19	vjones	what's that, you want to commit your changes? oh, that's git commit
2014-11-02 23:05:27	vjones	you want to make a new branch? That's git branch
2014-11-02 23:05:56	bkero	vjones: add-commit-push is easy, but advanced features of git not so much
2014-11-02 23:05:59	vjones	checkout is a bit overloaded, but it's worth it to unify movement inside your repo
2014-11-02 23:06:16	vjones	git makes it easier than other systems I've used
2014-11-02 23:06:19	Krampus	man, watching a clip of Beerfest makes me want to watch the whole movie.
2014-11-02 23:06:22	vjones	that's good enough for me
2014-11-02 23:06:24	bkero	reset vs revert vs checkout, etc
2014-11-02 23:06:28	Krampus	...and want to drink some goldschlager.
2014-11-02 23:06:42	vjones	bkero: each does very different things
2014-11-02 23:07:11	vjones	Beerfest was an amazing movie
2014-11-02 23:07:27	Krampus	vjones: have you ever loaned it to a german?  Because that is the greatest thing ever.
2014-11-02 23:07:36	bkero	vjones: exactly
2014-11-02 23:07:47	vjones	Krampus: no, but that sounds awesome
2014-11-02 23:08:01	Krampus	vjones: he was like "...that is not germany."

2014-11-03 16:18:00	kini	A: Read the Gang of Four, it's all in there
2014-11-03 16:19:00	pyro	:|
2014-11-03 16:20:33	Corbin	Fortunately, GoF doesn't work on Forth or Prolog yet.
2014-11-03 16:22:56	pilgrimd	Ehn... which Gang of Four?
2014-11-03 16:24:38	Corbin	Ringo, Paul, George, and John.
2014-11-03 16:25:10	Corbin	Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John.
2014-11-03 16:25:55	Corbin	Jack, Johnny, Jimmy, and José.
2014-11-03 16:26:54	pilgrimd	Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda?
2014-11-03 16:27:57	@kennobaka	Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen?
2014-11-03 16:29:25	Corbin	George, Thomas, Teddy, and Abe.
2014-11-03 16:31:06	Corbin	Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger.
2014-11-03 16:31:06	pilgrimd	I'll bet it's actually Murdock, Baracus, Smith, and Peck.  Those dudes really knew how to spin a lesson about system design.
2014-11-03 16:31:49	Corbin	I am a little embarrassed that my TV chops are good enough to get your lists.
2014-11-03 16:32:00	pilgrimd	Corbin: you say Toad and I think the other three need to be Mario, Luigi, and Peach.
2014-11-03 16:32:05	Corbin	I don't recognize kennobaka's but I have a feeling that it's due to missing an Eastern history class.
2014-11-03 16:32:25	pilgrimd	Corbin: That an kennobaka has a penchant for obscurity. ;)
2014-11-03 16:32:28	 *	dondon only gets the Design Patterns & Bible references
2014-11-03 16:32:57	pilgrimd	dondon: Ringo, Paul, George, and John are the Beatles
2014-11-03 16:33:00	Corbin	dondon: The Beatles are one. The "four horsemen" are another; four hard liquors that should not be combined.
2014-11-03 16:33:15	pilgrimd	Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda is Sex and the City
2014-11-03 16:33:18	Corbin	Teddy, Abe, and the two Framers are on Mount Rushmore.
2014-11-03 16:33:34	pilgrimd	Murdock, Baracus, Smith, and Peck is the A-Team
2014-11-03 16:33:35	dondon	ah, right, I did get hte Presidents
2014-11-03 16:33:42	Corbin	Mole, Rat, (Mister) Toad, and Badger are the protagonists of Wind in the Willows.
2014-11-03 16:34:09	Corbin	There aren't many famous listings of exactly four people, are there?
2014-11-03 16:34:40	dondon	there are probably several more from Eastern mythos
2014-11-03 16:34:41	Corbin	I guess that TV is rife with them. Peter, Glen, Joe, and Cleveland.
2014-11-03 16:35:30	pilgrimd	Corbin: Ufgood, Madmartigan, Rool and Franjean. :)
2014-11-03 16:35:50	Corbin	pilgrimd: You have bested me. I have no idea on that one, well played.
2014-11-03 16:35:59	pilgrimd	Willow (one of my favourite movies)
2014-11-03 16:36:21	Corbin	Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Ron. Of course, they're pretty recognizable due to Hermione's relatively rare name.
2014-11-03 16:36:38	pilgrimd	Madmartigan is Val Kilmer's character, Ufgood is Willow's last name. The other two are the Brownies.
2014-11-03 16:36:53	pilgrimd	Now I need to watch Willow.
2014-11-03 16:36:54	dondon	neville == neville chamberlain
2014-11-03 16:37:10	pilgrimd	I also need to finish making my apartment so I can have people over for movie nights.

2014-11-03 18:57:48	@kennobaka	alternatively, you might want to ask your question on /r/ExplainLikeImCalvin
2014-11-03 18:58:58	Epitrope	hah, nice
2014-11-03 20:18:59	Wren	relsqui: he actually just misread it as n. I could have gotten it regraded, but then he would regrade the entire exam.
2014-11-03 21:13:34	benji	any suggestions on who to avoid for cs350?
2014-11-03 21:18:02	Wren	pretty much the consensus seems be to be York. I'm more neutral at this point
2014-11-03 21:18:25	whopper	350 with york is like running a marathon
2014-11-03 21:18:32	whopper	but you learn the stuff pretty well
2014-11-03 21:21:52	benji	currently andrew black is teaching it winter term
2014-11-03 21:22:07	benji	and another TBA prof
2014-11-03 21:27:35	 *	dondon feels like upper div cs is poorly balanced
2014-11-03 21:28:26	dondon	like compilers , 311, and 350 are 15± hr a week, but then there's db and 300 which are 3hrs/wk
2014-11-03 21:30:12	dondon	ofc, by this point having a research undergrad degree seperate from thw prograing practicals kinda makes sense. there is theory to programming ofx, but they can't cover all of it currently
2014-11-03 21:54:18	@kennobaka	york++
2014-11-03 21:54:54	@kennobaka	easily one of the hardest classes I had, but it was worth it
2014-11-03 22:00:58	sectoidman	I had 350 with black, and it was alright
2014-11-03 22:01:27	sectoidman	karmabot, cessna

2014-11-04 22:01:33	pilgrimd	School is mandatory, health insurance is mandatory, taxes are mandatory, it's mandatory that we let people bitch about those things.
2014-11-04 22:01:50	pilgrimd	But it's NOT mandatory that people actually do their part to shape it. That's broken, IMO.
2014-11-04 22:03:21	pilgrimd	Cynically, voting is just enumerated complaining.  Americans love to complain, so we might as well have them do it usefully.
2014-11-04 22:04:17	vjones	yeah, but if voting were mandatory, then $OTHER_PARTY might have the advantage!

2014-11-04 22:37:00	dondon	pilgrimd: can I get high by second-hand marijauna?
2014-11-04 22:37:37	pilgrimd	dondon: It's called a contact high and yes, you can.
2014-11-04 22:37:57	pilgrimd	For those of us with adverse reactions to marijuana, SHS and contact highs suck. :(
2014-11-04 22:43:04	joshproehl	For those of us with Asthma more smoking anywhere really sucks too... I love that people can do what they want at home, but having to walk through the perpetual haze in the park blocks to get to the "clean air corridor" has become really painful.
2014-11-04 22:43:26	joshproehl	I propose a ballot measure wherein if I breathe any smoke you have produced via any method, I get to punch you in the lungs. (Like you just did to me.)
2014-11-04 22:43:48	lewisrjc	yeah....I was going to say. I don't even have asthma and it's awful
2014-11-04 22:43:48	bkero	joshproehl: It's still illegal in public places aiui
2014-11-04 22:44:01	pilgrimd	joshproehl: I just want a ban on smoking in any area, indoors or outdoors, including private spaces, that are accessible to minors.
2014-11-04 22:44:35	lewisrjc	bkero: the bill says 1 ounce in public, now I have no idea what that means, but that's according to the internet what the bill sates
2014-11-04 22:44:46	joshproehl	pilgrimd: I could go for that, but "including private spaces" is perhaps slightly troubling..

2014-11-04 22:45:11	bkero	It's not nearly as bad as it used to be.
2014-11-04 22:45:18	pilgrimd	joshproehl: It's to prohibit people from smoking in their home if kids live there.
2014-11-04 22:45:58	bkero	wee-eww, wee-eww, morality police
2014-11-04 22:46:06	joshproehl	pilgrimd: I think you're going to have to reword that to "in the presence of minors", otherwise you're making it impossible to go out on the back porch while the kids are in the basement..
2014-11-04 22:46:08	lewisrjc	clarkb: That sounds delightful. I mean wretched. Tobacco smoke gives me terrible headaches
2014-11-04 22:46:08	pilgrimd	clarkb: Does cigarette smoke smell as horrible over there as it does here? I ask because any time I've smelled foreign tobacco, it's far less foul.
2014-11-04 22:46:52	pilgrimd	joshproehl: No, the wording is intentional. Smoking clings to surfaces, so if you smoke while the kids aren't home, they get poisoned when they come home and touch things.
2014-11-04 22:47:53	joshproehl	pilgrimd: I'm with you in principle, I just get reaaaaaally squidgy about stopping people from doing what they want on their personal property... 
2014-11-04 22:48:03	joshproehl	I do too many unpopular things to feel comfortable with that precedent. :-D
2014-11-04 22:48:10	clarkb	pilgrimd foreign cigarretes are the worst

2014-11-04 22:48:46	pilgrimd	joshproehl: I am as well, but I also hold that endangering others, particularly those without the ability to decide for or defend themselves, takes a higher priority.

2014-11-04 22:50:37	joshproehl	pilgrimd: It's an interesting problem. I'm for banning exposing minors to religious indoctrination for the same reasons, so I have to agree... But it's REALLY slippery as far as slopes go.
2014-11-04 22:51:04	pilgrimd	joshproehl: Can't legislate religion. I also hold that one pretty far up.
2014-11-04 22:51:15	bkero	I think until we can understand how bad the problem is/would be, we have better things to do that we know will have a larger impact.
2014-11-04 22:51:15	joshproehl	pilgrimd: What about when I'm not allowed to own guns because I have a kid at home? (Never mind whatever extent I go to in order to secure them.)

2014-11-04 22:52:08	pilgrimd	joshproehl: That brings in the subject of "inherent risk" versus "potential risk".  Tobacco smoke is inherently dangerous, even after the fact.  A gun is not inherently dangerous.

Perhaps there's another channel for that, but it is important. :-)

2014-11-04 23:03:13	@kennobaka	or does HIGH not include EXPORT anyway?
2014-11-04 23:03:22	pilgrimd	kennobaka: No need, starting with HIGH instead of ALL means you don't include them.  Do people seriously just never read documentation?
2014-11-04 23:03:51	@kennobaka	based on my experience, yes
2014-11-04 23:05:21	pilgrimd	bkero: That's why you read the docs and test the cipherspec.  Try mine.  No CTR ciphers.  Why? Because they aren't enabled by default.
2014-11-04 23:05:59	bkero	Unfortunately the cipherlist doesn't seem to be included in the documentation

2014-11-04 23:06:52	pilgrimd	bkero: The ciphers(1) man page lists ciphers on a per-protocol basis.  You can also simply do `openssl ciphers ALL` if you want the list.
2014-11-04 23:07:21	@kennobaka	I never really got the point of the export-crippled restriction; wouldn't people just not use those ciphers and come up with better ones? It's not like there are no cryptanalysts in China

2014-11-05 10:38:37	pilgrimd	bkero: At least I actually GOT a response. That's already a massive improvement over previous experiences contributing to Mozilla.
2014-11-05 10:46:28	MaddHatter	kennobaka: in there era when export limitations were relevant, the US really did have the best crypto. That's a bygone era now, however the laws haven't moved with the times.
2014-11-05 10:47:02	MaddHatter	and the export controls had a large influence in causing advanced crypto to be (deliberately) developed outside the US to avoid those controls, so it arguably had the opposite effect intended
2014-11-05 10:47:23	pilgrimd	MaddHatter: Those laws created a good thing: advanced crypto code is now written outside the US.
2014-11-05 10:47:34	pilgrimd	wow that's some lag

2014-11-05 11:26:45	pilgrimd	bkero: That tells me the wiki page is laying down a policy not based in practical crypto, but some theoretical model.  In practice, the order chosen prefers weaker ciphers over stronger ones.
2014-11-05 11:27:25	MaddHatter	then the ticket would need to make its way to opsec somehow. (I don't know how to make that happen in their system.)
2014-11-05 11:27:35	pilgrimd	bkero: Mozilla has a very long history of the infallability delusion, so it's not worth my time trying to change their view.

2014-11-05 12:10:37	commander	how can I store binary 00 in unsigned char in c and shift 0110 again..so char will end up as 000110
2014-11-05 12:10:57	lewisrjc	commander: hex
2014-11-05 12:11:13	lewisrjc	0x00
2014-11-05 12:11:21	commander	im reading in from file
2014-11-05 12:12:18	lewisrjc	well,  a char is 8 bits first off, so I think you mean you have
2014-11-05 12:12:28	lewisrjc	0b0000_0000
2014-11-05 12:12:51	lewisrjc	and then you shift in 0110?
2014-11-05 12:13:02	commander	im reading binary and store into char (8bits), when char is full it write it out
2014-11-05 12:13:11	lewisrjc	ending with 0b0000_0000
2014-11-05 12:13:32	commander	so i would just shift byte << 0110?
2014-11-05 12:13:38	lewisrjc	uh
2014-11-05 12:14:06	lewisrjc	no, shift moves the bits in the byte by the number give
2014-11-05 12:14:16	lewisrjc	(that's 6 in decimal right?
2014-11-05 12:14:21	lewisrjc	so if you had say
2014-11-05 12:14:38	lewisrjc	0b0000_0001 << 0b0110
2014-11-05 12:14:42	lewisrjc	it would become
2014-11-05 12:15:05	lewisrjc	0b0100_0000
2014-11-05 12:15:18	commander	what does underscore represent?
2014-11-05 12:15:27	lewisrjc	just a spacer to make that readable
2014-11-05 12:15:43	lewisrjc	I don't think that's valid in C but it's used in a lot of other languages
2014-11-05 12:16:04	lewisrjc	I also am not sure if 0b is actually correct (if factI think it isn't)
2014-11-05 12:16:30	commander	sorry im still confused. first I store 0x00 in char, then i need to shift 0110 into char which would become 000110
2014-11-05 12:17:11	lewisrjc	well 0x000110 isn't a byte
2014-11-05 12:17:31	commander	ya 0x makes a hex
2014-11-05 12:17:49	commander	i meant to say that binary value of char will be 000110
2014-11-05 12:18:23	lewisrjc	you wouldn't use shift you would use bitwise or most likely
2014-11-05 12:18:46	lewisrjc	so you would have 0x00
2014-11-05 12:18:51	lewisrjc	er
2014-11-05 12:18:52	commander	i keep adding binary into char until its 8 bits
2014-11-05 12:19:01	lewisrjc	a = 0x00
2014-11-05 12:19:22	lewisrjc	are you doing bit packing?
2014-11-05 12:19:59	lewisrjc	and to continue from abov
2014-11-05 12:20:03	lewisrjc	a= 0x00;
2014-11-05 12:20:20	lewisrjc	b= 0x06
2014-11-05 12:20:31	lewisrjc	a = a|b
2014-11-05 12:20:38	lewisrjc	would make a = 0x06
2014-11-05 12:21:18	commander	oh okay. i also need to keep track of how many bits i have added.
2014-11-05 12:21:22	lewisrjc	yes
2014-11-05 12:21:29	alevar	commander: Side note: careful about putting '00' in front of an integer literal.
2014-11-05 12:21:36	alevar	It turns the literal into octal.
2014-11-05 12:21:40	alevar	0, rather
2014-11-05 12:22:01	alevar	0777 -> 511
2014-11-05 12:22:22	lewisrjc	if you are doing what I think you are doing you will have to track how many bits you have put into the char
2014-11-05 12:22:25	commander	so i want to put three 0's in char, i would do a = a | 0 in loop three times?
2014-11-05 12:22:50	alevar	Dreadfully confusing. THere's a reason Python 3 switched to 0o777
2014-11-05 12:22:52	commander	lewisrjc: yes. i have keep the count until it hits 8. then i write out char to file
2014-11-05 12:22:58	commander	text file
2014-11-05 12:23:15	lewisrjc	well, assuming a is initialized to 0, that sort of works
2014-11-05 12:23:29	commander	ok let me try it. thanks guys
2014-11-05 12:23:32	lewisrjc	commander: are you adding 1 bit at a time?
2014-11-05 12:23:49	lewisrjc	if so you will need to shift the bit to the correct position
2014-11-05 12:24:23	lewisrjc	so it's more like a= a | (0 << i) where i is the bit you are trying to modify
2014-11-05 12:24:38	lewisrjc	but it's important for this to work that a is initialized to 0
2014-11-05 12:25:14	lewisrjc	anyways, take y'all
2014-11-05 12:25:18	lewisrjc	good luck commander

2014-11-05 12:36:07	alevar	One of my greatest regrets about this election: Oregonians can't make jokes about legalizing gay marijuana. :(
2014-11-05 12:36:59	ryan	huh?
2014-11-05 12:37:43	alevar	Last election, Washingtonians legalized gay marijuana (same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana)
2014-11-05 12:38:48	pilgrimd	alevar: My greatest regret is that Oregonians once again proved they don't want to fund education (measure 86)
2014-11-05 12:41:07	alevar	pilgrimd: I'm still not exactly sure what the idea behind that one is.
2014-11-05 12:41:26	alevar	As in, why was it going before voters as a constitutional amendment?
2014-11-05 12:41:43	pilgrimd	alevar: It would have created a fund for post-secondary education financial aid.
2014-11-05 12:43:16	pilgrimd	The way it would have been set up, state bonds and private contributions would have gone into it and the aid would have been paid out from capital gains.
2014-11-05 12:44:34	pilgrimd	The best part is that it would have applied to trade schools, so Oregon could fund the process of moving a lot of people out of universities and back to trade certs and associates degrees--something we really do need to do in this country.
2014-11-05 12:45:30	pilgrimd	We've managed to screw over two entire generations of people with the lie that they need a four-year degree or better to earn a decent living.  The reality is, the majority of good jobs require only technical training.
2014-11-05 12:45:59	pilgrimd	Universities refuse to provide trade training, so we've created a system where everyone is going after an education that is absolutely not what they need.

2014-11-05 12:48:47	pilgrimd	alevar: Specifically university, so associates degrees are out.
2014-11-05 12:49:29	pilgrimd	About half of the people who go to university don't complete a degree. So that's a third of the last two generations with education debt that didn't become a degree.
2014-11-05 12:50:53	Wren	alevar: RE: why it's a constitutional amendments: The Oregonian Constitution gets used for all sorts of stuff. We've had cigarette taxes and stuff like that. It's the consequence of letting it be amendable by simple majority.
2014-11-05 12:51:11	Wren	So it's an easy place to hang any sort of legislation.
2014-11-05 13:25:51	MaddHatter	pilgrimd: I want to fund education, but I don't want to enable the state to deficit-spend
2014-11-05 13:26:27	MaddHatter	alevar: it had to be a constitutional amendment because the constitution is what prevents Oregon from deficit-spending.
2014-11-05 13:26:58	alevar	MaddHatter: ah
2014-11-05 13:27:20	alevar	It would have been nice if something said that...
2014-11-05 13:27:31	xxerro	Wren: Like the Equal Rights amendment that just got passed. It's just clutter to the Oregon Constitution aimed at leveraging a federal move. Even the ACLU dismissed it. 
2014-11-05 13:27:47	MaddHatter	I was surprised by how overwhelmingly that passed
2014-11-05 13:28:01	MaddHatter	yet the driver card failed by the same margin

2014-11-05 13:28:22	Corbin	Education is tricky to spend money on, since there's not much state money sitting around for it.
2014-11-05 13:28:36	Corbin	If only we could convince the feds to reallocate some of their discretional spending...

2014-11-06 12:58:52	ryan	so I have this object in python, let's call him obj, and he has some attributes, let's call them a, b and c. I can do obj.a, obj.b, obj.c, etc... but what if I have a variable s that contains the name of the attribute that I want? I want to get obj.{{s}}! Like the equivalent of obj.send(s.to_sym) in Ruby, does anybody know how in Python?
2014-11-06 12:59:19	relsqui	obj.get(s)

2014-11-07 16:47:18	stacybird	ah neat idea

2014-11-09 23:05:53	pilgrimd	lewisrjc: Hey, no fair expecting the FF devs to use modern methods!
2014-11-09 23:06:05	pilgrimd	They're just barely getting over the Netscape PTSD.
2014-11-09 23:06:23	retrov	oh and the JS engine isn't as fast as chrome/webkit/safari. Kibana and Grafana can really slow it down
2014-11-09 23:06:43	retrov	FTL++
2014-11-09 23:07:12	pilgrimd	retrov: I used Chrome for a long time, but I had to abandon it for Firefox because I simply could not control it properly. Ironic, considering the things I needed to do were driven by initiatives Google themselves are pushing.
2014-11-09 23:08:01	lewisrjc	is chrome still 1 tab 1 process?
2014-11-09 23:08:14	vjones	that's the last I've heard
2014-11-09 23:08:15	dondon	lewisrjc: 1 tab, 3+ process
2014-11-09 23:08:22	clarkb	ish
2014-11-09 23:08:30	vjones	that's sorta horrendous
2014-11-09 23:08:34	dondon	tab manager + html renderer + js sandbox +...
2014-11-09 23:08:46	vjones	I mean, I understand why they do it
2014-11-09 23:08:56	pilgrimd	vjones: But on the plus side, it means one tab crashing doesn't kill the whole browser. Oh wait...
2014-11-09 23:08:58	vjones	but still, that's a lot of clutter cluttering up my process list
2014-11-09 23:09:04	vjones	lol
2014-11-09 23:09:33	retrov	pilgrimd: i actually haven't had that problem
2014-11-09 23:09:35	lewisrjc	vjones: it may be better on windows 8, but on windows 7 on my duo core system, it got really unhappy about having 20+ processes running
2014-11-09 23:09:37	@kennobaka	it's okay; there's like a 32,700 process IDs to use
2014-11-09 23:09:44	retrov	tabs crashing have never brought the whole browser dow
2014-11-09 23:09:46	retrov	down*
2014-11-09 23:10:06	retrov	and TBH, with modern CPUs, why not use more procs if it gets you benefits?
2014-11-09 23:10:28	vjones	how hard is it to kill if it does happen to lock up?
2014-11-09 23:10:32	lewisrjc	retrov: because it doesn't always get you benefits?
2014-11-09 23:10:47	@kennobaka	vjones: pkill -9 chrome
2014-11-09 23:10:53	clarkb	retrov memory :)
2014-11-09 23:10:55	lewisrjc	killing it wasn't the problem
2014-11-09 23:10:58	vjones	also: if you know a specific tab is causing the problem, can you figure out which process goes to which tab and just kill that one?
2014-11-09 23:10:59	lewisrjc	using it was the issue
2014-11-09 23:11:07	retrov	clarkb: still not as bad as FF
2014-11-09 23:11:13	dondon	vjones: not always
2014-11-09 23:11:15	vjones	I use ff, so I haven't played around with this
2014-11-09 23:11:17	clarkb	retrov its worse for me
2014-11-09 23:11:38	lewisrjc	it may be better now, this laptop never really ran well with windows 7
2014-11-09 23:11:41	clarkb	but I end up with all the tabs so likely a case of use
2014-11-09 23:11:49	dondon	and tabs crashing *has* brought schrome down for me, though that was back before I moved back to FF
2014-11-09 23:12:04	vjones	I leverage the shit out of firefox's tab groups, so I always have a ton of tabs open
2014-11-09 23:12:39	lewisrjc	firefox has tabgroups?
2014-11-09 23:12:50	vjones	Ctrl-Shift-e
2014-11-09 23:12:56	dondon	since 28 or so
2014-11-09 23:13:00	vjones	longer
2014-11-09 23:13:07	vjones	it's been around a loooong time
2014-11-09 23:13:11	lewisrjc	HOLY MOLY
2014-11-09 23:13:14	lewisrjc	THAT"S AMAZING
2014-11-09 23:13:15	dondon	ah, it was 20
2014-11-09 23:13:52	lewisrjc	I doubt I will ever use it but that's amazing
2014-11-09 23:13:52	vjones	4
2014-11-09 23:15:10	vjones	god, it has been around forever
2014-11-09 23:15:17	dondon	vjones: really? I still have never found a use case for it, so I just put activities in seperate windows
2014-11-09 23:15:35	vjones	I started using it heavily for work
2014-11-09 23:15:47	vjones	and then started using it more on my personal system
2014-11-09 23:15:53	vjones	it's just a nice way to keep things organized
2014-11-09 23:16:24	vjones	I'm pretty bad about just leaving shit running
2014-11-09 23:16:27	lewisrjc	yeah, I mean, I often have 20 tabs open
2014-11-09 23:16:36	lewisrjc	but it's rarely a big issue
2014-11-09 23:17:00	vjones	...
2014-11-09 23:17:06	vjones	I should probably close some tabs
2014-11-09 23:17:12	clarkb	just 20?
2014-11-09 23:17:23	vjones	I've got about 40 right now
2014-11-09 23:17:30	clarkb	I consolidate around 300-400
2014-11-09 23:17:31	vjones	but I've also got 16GB of ram
2014-11-09 23:17:39	vjones	clarkb wins
2014-11-09 23:18:05	clarkb	I set up a tab limiter plugin. 100 was my limit. I lasted about 4 hours
2014-11-09 23:18:56	 *	dondon manages to naturally keep it at 100 or so, but maybe mostly training from only having 2GB of RAM total
2014-11-09 23:19:28	dondon	ofc, opening one tab with a google service in it... +300MB right there
2014-11-09 23:19:40	vjones	ugh
2014-11-09 23:20:25	vjones	dag, I should get to bed
2014-11-09 23:20:42	 *	dondon needs to try all the desktop mail clients, on a stable os this time
2014-11-09 23:20:47	vjones	goodnight, all

2014-11-11 12:13:46	pilgrimd	If that was their origin, they've strayed far from the original charter. Things friends have had happen at PSU: refused leave for reserve service, forced to resignation for deployment, and terminated after going on extended medical leave due to PTSD.
2014-11-11 12:14:23	pilgrimd	That last one, of course, meaning they lost the medical insurance that was paying for the treatment.

2014-11-11 13:22:06	MaddHatter	I have never worked for a private company that observes Veteran's Day, so PSU is a bit of an outlier that it does. I think PSU skips President's Day or MLK to make up for it, though?

2014-11-11 14:20:21	pilgrimd	MaddHatter: Sure, the VA provides some limited services to vets, but it's a known massive shortcoming of the military complex.  The US does not take good care of its vets.
2014-11-11 14:21:14	pilgrimd	But there are lots of private services that can be used for veterans' needs.  The specific issue I referred to, though, was getting screwed out of a job because he needed a two-week medical leave to go to a treatment center.
2014-11-11 14:22:39	pilgrimd	He got the approval, someone screwed up and approved it without getting a proper process, he gets back home to find a termination letter and huge medical bills because his insurance was cancelled.
2014-11-11 14:23:03	pilgrimd	That one had to go through lawyers before it was resolved.
2014-11-11 14:24:39	MaddHatter	ow.

2014-11-12 14:48:13	relsqui	although it's also another course to pay for :/ hmm

2014-11-12 15:04:28	relsqui	oh, yeah

2014-11-12 15:05:17	relsqui	yeah, I'm not worried about the difficulty
2014-11-12 15:05:25	relsqui	the real reason is it's just lower-priority than the courses I just registered for
2014-11-12 15:05:43	relsqui	especially since I'm dropping to quarter time to go a little easier on my mental health next term :P
2014-11-12 15:06:37	lewisrjc	that's not a bad idea

2014-11-12 15:22:32	kini	speaking of clever shit involving libraries, I'm sad that ReSSL got renamed to TLS

2014-11-12 15:34:12	relsqui	I'm not nearly enough of a c hacker to feel like I could justify owning one of those
2014-11-12 15:34:16	relsqui	it is really good, though
2014-11-12 15:35:34	relsqui	... huh, speaking of python hackers, what the hell happened to cam? did he just disappear into janrain?

2014-11-12 18:14:08	sabreman	I'm having some really funky issues with my ubuntu drive, and an ubuntu vm
2014-11-12 18:14:32	sabreman	firstly: my ubuntu box gets strage driver corruption after a while of usage no matter what i do
2014-11-12 18:14:48	sabreman	http://i.imgur.com/s0ng7u5.png
2014-11-12 18:14:51	sabreman	a pic of what i mean
2014-11-12 18:15:02	sabreman	(I have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed)
2014-11-12 18:15:17	sabreman	the only way to fix this is to reboot lightdm (logout, restart service, reboot, etc)
2014-11-12 18:15:41	sabreman	Second: When I'm sshing into a VM from my computer security class, the terminal wont resize
2014-11-12 18:15:56	sabreman	like it'll always stay at 24x80, even if I manualy export thoese values
2014-11-12 18:16:25	sabreman	It's not a problem on my end, since i can ssh into other machines in the linux lab for instance, and everything resizes just fine.
2014-11-12 18:16:27	sabreman	Any ideas?
2014-11-12 18:19:26	dondon	sabreman: if the VMs are set up by Charles Wright, the same way he did the NetSec class, then you are sshing to a telnet host. There is a command to redetect the size in telnet... maybe 'resize'?
2014-11-12 18:19:52	dondon	the video corruption looks like a "nvidia really hates me" problem, though
2014-11-12 18:20:30	dondon	sabreman: which nvidia drivers, the opensource or the straight-from-nvidia ones?

2014-11-12 18:25:27	sabreman	dondon: no resize command, i tried (one of the google search results hinted at that) and the straight from the source drivers.
2014-11-12 18:25:42	sabreman	I need to mention, that this a "portable" distro that i installed on a flash drive
2014-11-12 18:25:55	sabreman	the corruption also hapens on an AMD chipset (I install the ati drivers there)
2014-11-12 18:26:30	dondon	sounds like the card itself may be going bad then.
2014-11-12 18:26:32	sabreman	afaik it also happens with the generic x.org drivers
2014-11-12 18:26:47	sabreman	I would think that to, but like i said, two diffrent machines
2014-11-12 18:26:53	dondon	stormcrow: do you remember the ssh+telnet trick we used for netsec?
2014-11-12 18:26:58	sabreman	Also when i use windows on this box, I have no problems
2014-11-12 18:27:21	dondon	sabreman: ah wait. so you plugged in the same usb drive to both the nvidia and amd machines?
2014-11-12 18:27:29	stormcrow	dondon: not off the top of my head. might be in my notes
2014-11-12 18:27:29	sabreman	yes
2014-11-12 18:27:49	sabreman	dondon: obv I install the appropriate drivers for whatever machine im at
2014-11-12 18:28:15	dondon	sabreman: right but more things have to be right about the install than just the driver being installed
2014-11-12 18:28:30	sabreman	Enlighten me please, I'd love to fix this.
2014-11-12 18:30:35	dondon	sabreman: so a) it has to use your driver, instead of falling back to mesa/vesa, b) xorg configs need to be right c) hardware needs to be okay and some more that I don't know and have left broken everytime I can't make them work
