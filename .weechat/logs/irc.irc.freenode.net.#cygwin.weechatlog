2013-04-02 14:33:54	sabreman	ok so, running cygwin on an ntfs partition
2013-04-02 14:34:02	sabreman	and i want to set up an ssh key wiht openssh
2013-04-02 14:34:33	sabreman	Open ssh requires that the private key file only have read permissions for me (and no one else)
2013-04-02 14:34:52	sabreman	however it looks like ntfs doesnt properly handle user and group permissions, so when i try to set user permissions
2013-04-02 14:34:57	sabreman	it sets the group ones as well.
2013-04-02 14:35:15	sabreman	meaning, i can't set the permissions properly for openssh to accept the file
2013-04-02 14:35:30	sabreman	is there any way around this wihtout re-compiling openssh to pysicly remove the cheks?

2013-04-02 15:37:05	hp	sabreman: which group does ls -l say the file belongs to?
2013-04-02 15:37:52	census	hi hp!
2013-04-02 15:38:16	hp	hey
2013-04-02 15:38:42	census	thank you so much for all of your help earlier! :)
2013-04-02 15:39:07	hp	well did it actually help though?
2013-04-02 15:39:52	census	seriously yes!!!
2013-04-02 15:39:56	census	not kidding at all!!
2013-04-02 15:39:59	census	you helped me SOOO much
2013-04-02 15:42:05	census	now i'm strugglign with one last one
2013-04-02 15:43:54	hp	at the cpan prompt, try "clean Net::SSLeay"
2013-04-02 15:44:15	hp	then "install Net::SSLeay" again
2013-04-02 15:44:23	census	well at the moment, i'm trying to download some gcc4 stuff as well ...
2013-04-02 15:44:52	hp	it may have left some garbage when it tried to install it first and failed
2013-04-02 15:45:10	census	is that a capital c for clean?
2013-04-02 15:45:24	hp	it isn't
2013-04-02 15:47:41	hp	for future reference, type "help" at the cpan prompt for a command summary
2013-04-02 15:47:51	census	http://scsys.co.uk:8002/238998?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
2013-04-02 15:51:21	census	is that what you had suggestd?
2013-04-02 15:51:51	hp	yes, but it didn't work
2013-04-02 15:56:05	hp	i have no idea how to remove a package from cpan to try a clean install
2013-04-02 15:57:16	hp	you can try deleting the directory from the cpan/build directory
2013-04-02 15:57:31	census	how would that work?
2013-04-02 15:57:55	hp	"look Net::SSLeay"
2013-04-02 15:58:01	hp	should put you in the directory
2013-04-02 15:58:08	hp	with a shell prompt
2013-04-02 15:59:20	hp	"cd .." and "rm -r Net-SSLeay-..." where ... is whatever it's called
2013-04-02 15:59:50	hp	if your shell is bash or zsh, you can probably hit <TAB> at that point to have it complete the name
2013-04-02 16:00:37	census	did i do something wrong? http://scsys.co.uk:8002/239014?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
2013-04-02 16:00:55	census	oops
2013-04-02 16:00:55	census	i did
2013-04-02 16:00:56	census	typo
2013-04-02 16:01:30	census	ok .. removed.
2013-04-02 16:01:38	census	now reinstall?
2013-04-02 16:01:57	hp	yeah, quitting out of that shell will return you to cpan
2013-04-02 16:02:11	hp	there, just try and install again
2013-04-02 16:02:14	census	so go back to cpan?
2013-04-02 16:02:23	hp	don't type "cpan"
2013-04-02 16:02:40	hp	in the shell that opened when you typed look Net:SSLeay, type "exit"
2013-04-02 16:02:50	hp	and you should be back in cpan
2013-04-02 16:02:53	hp	correct?
2013-04-02 16:04:21	hp	cpan opened a subshell for you to do stuff, but it's still running. if you just run cpan a second time, it will get confused and swear at you
2013-04-02 16:04:51	hp	at least i would
2013-04-02 16:05:09	sabreman	oh sorry i was afk
2013-04-02 16:05:18	sabreman	let me check
2013-04-02 16:06:06	sabreman	none
