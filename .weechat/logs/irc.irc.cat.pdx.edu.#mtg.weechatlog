2014-07-05 19:00:02	sabreman	Ok so that should be better. I honestly have no idea why it was disconnecting me THAT much
2014-07-05 19:00:16	sabreman	also im not sure if i was talking in mtg or tabletop before
2014-07-05 19:00:27	sabreman	anyway i'll stick to rita now so it shouldn't be a problem
2014-07-05 19:22:26	@dom	its all good man
2014-07-05 19:22:37	@dom	it was easy to see it wasn't your fault

2014-07-06 17:22:36	@relsqui	I could look it up, but I'm lazy
2014-07-06 17:25:24	@relsqui	otoh you're not here, so
2014-07-06 17:25:26	 *	relsqui looks it up, is right
2014-07-06 17:26:32	 *	relsqui is proud of myself for getting that call right
2014-07-06 17:27:03	@relsqui	("wait, if I discard su-chi ... ?" "uh, as worded, yes, but I bet that's been errata'd, let me check")
2014-07-06 19:50:17	@relsqui	haha I just had the "everyone plays magic" effect backwards; asked a question in #mtgrules and got an answer from someone who used to hang out in #xkcd

2014-07-06 22:05:31	@relsqui	if you mindslaver a player who's got no other slivers but !card hibernation sliver

2014-07-06 22:05:37	@relsqui	>:|
2014-07-06 22:05:40	@relsqui	... anyway, can you kill them with it
2014-07-06 22:07:24	@relsqui	oh, weird.
2014-07-06 22:07:45	@relsqui	mancat: there's also one in here which is very similar to the one you asked me in class a while back, except it's quick sliver, conspiracy, and dryad arbor
2014-07-06 22:35:42	@relsqui	O_O I only just got around to reading new garruk
2014-07-06 23:56:49	@relsqui	huh, took me like 1/3 of the spoiler list to notice the card title font has changed
2014-07-07 01:04:30	@mancat	...wat?
2014-07-07 01:05:45	@relsqui	mancat: look at the baseline of a capital H, F, or K
2014-07-07 01:05:49	@relsqui	then compare to an old one
2014-07-07 01:05:56	@relsqui	(e.g. search "Heliod")
2014-07-07 01:08:01	@relsqui	mancat: on a side note -- after teaching my friend Ellen to play the other day, I think I understand a little better why you make skeptical noises at me when I say I feel like I still suck at it
2014-07-07 01:08:09	@relsqui	mancat: not because she didn't pick it up but because she did
2014-07-07 01:08:21	@relsqui	mancat: like, we were talking about ... I forget, something with "return blah to its owner's hand"
2014-07-07 01:08:37	@relsqui	and she was like "huh, 'owner's' because I might have stolen it from you or something"
2014-07-07 01:08:48	@relsqui	like, grokked that distinction immediately
2014-07-07 01:09:09	@relsqui	and mid-game could see what my right moves were very quickly
2014-07-07 01:09:26	@relsqui	("okay, so you take out my sylvan caryatid" right after playing garruk relentless and explaining wth planeswalkers are)
2014-07-07 01:20:54	@mancat	:P teaching magic to smart people is so much more fun
2014-07-07 01:21:07	@mancat	i've had some friends in the past...
2014-07-07 01:21:16	@mancat	but anyway
2014-07-07 01:21:43	@mancat	it's 1 am and my living room is still hot, but i'm going to get off this couch and go to bed because i got shit to do tomorrow
2014-07-07 01:25:28	@relsqui	hehe
2014-07-07 01:25:30	@relsqui	what's on your plate?
2014-07-07 01:25:38	@relsqui	(and yeah, (teaching smart people)++++++)
2014-07-07 11:10:20	@relsqui	mancat: duped from sms because I'm trying to get back to her asap: could you meet with courtney tomorrow at 2 instead of 11? she had to reschedule
2014-07-07 11:11:13	@mancat	yeah that's fine
2014-07-07 11:11:29	@relsqui	cool, thank you :)
2014-07-07 11:11:59	@relsqui	mm such sleeping in
2014-07-07 11:12:29	@relsqui	tradeoff is I'll have to scurry off to tutor at three
2014-07-07 11:12:59	@mancat	when did you tutor at three on monday?
2014-07-07 11:13:09	@mancat	i thought we didn't hardly have any shiofts together this yerm
2014-07-07 11:13:12	@mancat	*term
2014-07-07 11:14:22	@relsqui	tomorrow
2014-07-07 11:14:55	@relsqui	and yeah, we only overlap for an hour on fridays, but I have yet to work that shift and won't be starting this week because orientation XD
2014-07-07 11:15:07	@relsqui	and, actually, might try to move that hour off my regular schedule anyway so I can go to hiss
2014-07-07 11:15:13	@relsqui	I'm not avoiding you on purpose, I swear ;)
2014-07-07 11:15:23	@dom	^ terrible liar

2014-07-07 11:15:48	@relsqui	I mean, I am
2014-07-07 11:15:51	@relsqui	but it's not presently relevant
2014-07-07 11:22:21	@relsqui	anyway I read spoilers and now I'm excited for M15
2014-07-07 11:22:25	@relsqui	just in time for prerelease :D
2014-07-07 11:23:04	@relsqui	oh balls and my linux workshop is this weekend >_> limits the times I can go
2014-07-07 11:23:21	@relsqui	I really want to do the midnight thing but would p. much have to crash downtown
2014-07-07 11:23:58	@mancat	x_x i don't think i want to go to midnight prerelease, lol
2014-07-07 11:24:07	@mancat	that means getting home at like 4:30

2014-07-07 11:24:14	@mancat	stupid caps

2014-07-07 11:24:52	Golem	This isnt a movie, its a mtg set.  WHY MIDNIGHT!?
2014-07-07 11:25:35	@mancat	lol they always do midnight prerelease
2014-07-07 11:25:39	@mancat	it's an establishment
2014-07-07 11:25:46	@relsqui	mancat: yeah exactly
2014-07-07 11:25:48	@mancat	they do it other times too

2014-07-07 11:29:16	@mancat	too bad most fo them suck :(
2014-07-07 11:29:25	@mancat	the only playable ones are the green and blue one imo :(
2014-07-07 11:29:46	@relsqui	huh, you don't like indulgent tormentor?
2014-07-07 11:29:50	@mancat	hell no
2014-07-07 11:29:55	@relsqui	how come?
2014-07-07 11:29:57	@mancat	giving your opponent choices is always bad
2014-07-07 11:30:08	@mancat	and it's a 5/3 flyer for 5
2014-07-07 11:30:10	@relsqui	hmm
2014-07-07 11:30:21	@mancat	i'd play it in a heartbeat in draft, but it's just not oppresive in constructed
2014-07-07 11:30:24	@mancat	*shrug*
2014-07-07 11:30:30	@relsqui	fair enough

2014-07-07 11:31:29	@mancat	i'm pretty sure they made an Emrakul promo
2014-07-07 11:31:43	Golem	they certainly didnt make emurkul a prerelease promo

2014-07-07 11:34:56	Golem	well
2014-07-07 11:35:00	Golem	almost no constructed play
2014-07-07 11:35:01	@relsqui	*I'm* playing him in constructed
2014-07-07 11:35:02	@mancat	no but he was close to good enough

2014-07-07 11:35:15	@relsqui	mancat: that was my wrong call yesterday, btw
2014-07-07 11:35:21	@relsqui	whether you can respond to it transforming
2014-07-07 11:35:24	@mancat	DKA buy-a-box was Gravecrawler
2014-07-07 11:35:30	@mancat	aha
2014-07-07 11:35:37	@relsqui	for some reason I had it in my head that the transformation was a SBA instead of a trigger
2014-07-07 11:35:42	@mancat	though everything else from DKA sucked
2014-07-07 11:35:51	@relsqui	and reasoned correctly from the wrong premise
2014-07-07 11:35:55	@mancat	i'm not sure iw ould have got that right either
2014-07-07 11:36:03	@relsqui	heh, that's reassuring
2014-07-07 11:36:18	 *	mancat look sfor other good promo cards so he can be sad he deosn't own them
2014-07-07 11:36:45	@mancat	oh wow, AVR release promo was Restoration Angel :x
2014-07-07 11:36:52	Golem	sigh
2014-07-07 11:36:56	@mancat	indeed
2014-07-07 11:36:57	Golem	clearly i need to go to more releases
2014-07-07 11:36:57	@relsqui	heh
2014-07-07 11:37:07	@mancat	buy-a-box was silverblade paladin
2014-07-07 11:37:12	@mancat	:(
2014-07-07 11:37:20	@mancat	now i'm angry that M15 promos such so bad
2014-07-07 11:37:24	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-07 11:37:36	@mancat	the only one that's worth getting is the Game Day top 8
2014-07-07 11:37:41	@mancat	full art Chief Engineer
2014-07-07 11:37:51	@relsqui	obv gonna have to place in game day 0:)
2014-07-07 11:37:56	@mancat	obv
2014-07-07 11:38:16	@mancat	i wonder if chief engineer is gonna be as good a card as i think it is
2014-07-07 11:38:26	@mancat	it depends a lot on the meta i think, there's not a lot of artifact support right now
2014-07-07 11:38:30	@mancat	but i mean there are a few good ones
2014-07-07 11:38:39	@relsqui	mancat: yeah but I think they're setting that up for khans
2014-07-07 11:38:41	@mancat	the lording obelisk is kind of a prime choice
2014-07-07 11:38:44	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-07 11:38:53	@mancat	i don't think khans is going to be artifact-themed
2014-07-07 11:38:56	@relsqui	not mostly
2014-07-07 11:39:06	@relsqui	but I'm expecting those to support each other
2014-07-07 11:39:16	@mancat	but it only takes one or two dominant artifacts for constructed to make him good
2014-07-07 11:39:22	@relsqui	after reading m15 what I'm expecting from khans is dragons and tokens
2014-07-07 11:39:36	@mancat	if there's good enough early token generation i could see the lightning bolt / mana rock artifact getting played with this guy
2014-07-07 11:39:36	@relsqui	*lots* of things in the spoilers are set up to play well with lots of little critters
2014-07-07 11:39:48	@mancat	"Have you seen my free removal/ramp spell? it's pretty cool on turn 3"
2014-07-07 11:39:49	@dom	good to hear
2014-07-07 11:39:52	@dom	zoo or bust
2014-07-07 11:39:55	@dom	#zoo
2014-07-07 11:40:06	@mancat	yeah i think tokens is going to be a thing
2014-07-07 11:40:19	@mancat	i'm curious if they make ajani's pridemate live again
2014-07-07 11:40:29	@relsqui	oh lord, that's what we need :)
2014-07-07 11:40:31	@mancat	they seem to have carefully avoided soul-sisters style life gain in M15, which is a no-brainer
2014-07-07 11:40:37	@mancat	but khans might have something good
2014-07-07 11:40:41	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-07 11:40:52	 *	relsqui fidgets
2014-07-07 11:41:01	@relsqui	I see why everyone's excited about this set, though
2014-07-07 11:41:05	@mancat	:D
2014-07-07 11:41:07	@relsqui	I'm like "dammit even I want to build with this now"
2014-07-07 11:41:09	@mancat	best core set NA
2014-07-07 11:41:21	@mancat	i'm actually excited to do sealed with this set, which is basically never true
2014-07-07 11:41:27	@relsqui	nice!
2014-07-07 11:41:48	@dom	poor mancat can't even hate the new set
2014-07-07 11:41:52	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-07-07 11:41:53	@dom	whats left to live for
2014-07-07 11:41:59	@relsqui	no he's not the one who always hates on all the things
2014-07-07 11:42:03	@relsqui	he's usually the one rolling his eyes at the people who do that
2014-07-07 11:42:05	@relsqui	except theros
2014-07-07 11:42:10	@relsqui	because no one loves theros. poor theros.
2014-07-07 11:42:14	@dom	theros deserves the hate
2014-07-07 11:42:51	@mancat	^
2014-07-07 11:43:21	@relsqui	I'm almost glad I started in theros block, I have no context so I can't hate it as much as you guys do :P
2014-07-07 11:43:39	@dom	theros is the little prick of a kid in high school who dissed on the deaf kid
2014-07-07 11:43:51	@dom	when people find him beat up, no one is sad
2014-07-07 11:44:09	@relsqui	pshht
2014-07-07 11:44:19	@mancat	i think the blue clone guy and the giant black wrath are playable in like EDH
2014-07-07 11:44:30	@mancat	but none of the other promos are worth anything except the top 8
2014-07-07 11:44:39	@relsqui	meh
2014-07-07 11:44:46	@relsqui	I will show up because events are exciting and I wanna play with new things
2014-07-07 11:44:47	@relsqui	and I dun care.
2014-07-07 11:44:55	@mancat	oh wow, tormentor gives your an opponent *three* choices
2014-07-07 11:45:01	@mancat	so you can't even use it to kill them
2014-07-07 11:45:01	@relsqui	mhm
2014-07-07 11:45:03	@mancat	that is awful
2014-07-07 11:45:15	Golem	whats the third choice?
2014-07-07 11:45:23	@relsqui	card draw
2014-07-07 11:45:26	@mancat	^
2014-07-07 11:45:29	@relsqui	either I draw a card, or you sac a creature, or you lose 3 life
2014-07-07 11:45:33	Golem	ahh
2014-07-07 11:45:37	Golem	yeah its not great
2014-07-07 11:45:40	@mancat	like
2014-07-07 11:45:46	@mancat	if it was controller's choice
2014-07-07 11:45:51	@mancat	it would be an ok creature
2014-07-07 11:45:59	Golem	it would actually be amazing then
2014-07-07 11:45:59	@mancat	that would probably see play
2014-07-07 11:45:59	Golem	;p
2014-07-07 11:46:15	@mancat	and i don't even think it would be broken because i has 3 toughness and therefore dies to lots of burn
2014-07-07 11:46:21	@mancat	and trades poorly with many fliers
2014-07-07 11:46:35	@mancat	i mean, it's a 5/drop
2014-07-07 11:46:45	Golem	5 drop is the new 3 drop
2014-07-07 11:46:50	Golem	supposedly
2014-07-07 11:46:58	@mancat	whatever
2014-07-07 11:47:01	@dom	thats dumb
2014-07-07 11:47:01	@mancat	what does that even mean
2014-07-07 11:47:09	@dom	I dont want to play anything over 3 cost
2014-07-07 11:47:15	@mancat	whoever said that needs to have their eyes checked, lol
2014-07-07 11:47:18	@relsqui	ugh now I want to play magic
2014-07-07 11:47:23	@dom	if the game isn't over by 6 turns, I dont want to finish the game
2014-07-07 11:47:24	@mancat	dom, you should be playing Goblins
2014-07-07 11:47:27	@relsqui	oh, also I need to have my eyes checked, thanks for reminding me
2014-07-07 11:47:28	Golem	It means wizards is trying to slow the game down so that everything they print that costs between 6 and 13 is actually relevant
2014-07-07 11:47:48	@mancat	oh, gotcha
2014-07-07 11:47:49	@dom	mancat: I really should be, I love goblins
2014-07-07 11:47:58	@mancat	as in, 5 isn't an irrelevantly high cost any more
2014-07-07 11:48:00	@mancat	sure, i agree
2014-07-07 11:48:09	@mancat	but i mean there's also Baneslayer Angel and Titans and shit
2014-07-07 11:48:23	@mancat	and yeah they're the cream of the crop, but that's what constructed is
2014-07-07 11:48:29	@mancat	at least at competetive level
2014-07-07 11:48:46	@mancat	whatever the case, the 7-drops are terrible
2014-07-07 11:48:56	@mancat	for that matter i think phytotitan is terrible too
2014-07-07 11:49:04	@mancat	for 6, it should have trample
2014-07-07 11:49:29	Golem	I KNOW RIGHT
2014-07-07 11:49:31	@mancat	in a world where Iona exists, 7-drops that give you some life just aren't good enough
2014-07-07 11:49:31	Golem	ugh
2014-07-07 11:49:46	Golem	I could rant about green suddenly not getting trample on stuff for hours
2014-07-07 11:50:00	Golem	REACH IS NOT A GREEN ABILITY JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE SPIDERS
2014-07-07 11:50:04	@mancat	lol
2014-07-07 11:50:12	@dom	honestly, I think most things with 6 power or more should have trample
2014-07-07 11:50:17	@mancat	let's be realistic, it totally is a green ability
2014-07-07 11:50:24	@dom	they're almost all big things or really strong things
2014-07-07 11:50:27	@mancat	reach was basically invented because green isn't allowed to have flying
2014-07-07 11:50:38	@mancat	which makes it super soft to flyers
2014-07-07 11:50:43	@mancat	so they invented reach
2014-07-07 11:50:52	@mancat	it doesn't appear on basically any other color...
2014-07-07 11:51:12	@mancat	i'm not sure i strictly agree with that
2014-07-07 11:51:16	@mancat	from a game balance point of view
2014-07-07 11:51:32	Golem	cant argue about that
2014-07-07 11:51:39	@mancat	i think chump-blocking adds an interesting dimension to combat and making everything big have trample kind of makes things more yugioh
2014-07-07 11:51:43	@mancat	which is not a good thing
2014-07-07 11:51:59	Golem	but at the same time green should not be defined by an ability that can be summed up with the phrase "a shitter version of flying"
2014-07-07 11:52:01	@mancat	but i do think that things that have a very high power/toughness ratio shoudl have trample
2014-07-07 11:52:07	@mancat	because they're going to die on the swing almost evrey time
2014-07-07 11:52:40	Golem	It makes sense for green to get trample because big creatures are thier thing and if they dont have a way to make use of them....well they dont really have a thing
2014-07-07 11:52:49	@mancat	ok hold on
2014-07-07 11:52:55	@mancat	green is strong right now
2014-07-07 11:53:04	@mancat	the fucking green devotion guys are good enough
2014-07-07 11:53:05	Golem	define strong ;p
2014-07-07 11:53:15	@mancat	6/6 for 3 is strong
2014-07-07 11:53:21	@mancat	taps for 5 mana on turn 4 is strong
2014-07-07 11:53:21	@dom	if people are still playing other colors, green is not strong enough
2014-07-07 11:53:28	Golem	lol
2014-07-07 11:53:28	@dom	s/green/color you play/
2014-07-07 11:53:29	Golem	well
2014-07-07 11:53:47	Golem	thats a bit of an overstatement, but for the last 6 months green has basically been a trap color in constructed
2014-07-07 11:54:00	@mancat	i'm not saying green needs more trample because it' sunderpowered, i'm saying 7/2's need trample
2014-07-07 11:54:04	Golem	it hasnt won a tenth of the tournaments that blue, black, and white have
2014-07-07 11:54:21	Golem	but thats neither here nor there
2014-07-07 11:54:22	@mancat	because "dies to chump blcokers but comes back" is pretty much just worse than a vanilla 7/7, and that's not a cool rare
2014-07-07 11:54:45	@mancat	right because that doesn't accurately reflect the current state of standard
2014-07-07 11:54:52	Golem	but yeah, I agree about ptit
2014-07-07 11:54:54	@mancat	or the state of standard for the past 5 years
2014-07-07 11:58:56	@mancat	i like the art on the Reclamation Sage promo though
2014-07-07 11:59:32	@mancat	ooh hey i didn't notice, the buy-a-box promo os alright
2014-07-07 11:59:37	@mancat	it's the goblin piledriver guy
2014-07-07 11:59:51	@mancat	dom: get that guy, play goblins
2014-07-07 12:00:04	@mancat	oh man i should proxy you a Kuldotha Red goblins deck
2014-07-07 12:00:06	Golem	I suspect gobbos will be a thing again if khans has even 1 good goblin
2014-07-07 12:00:14	@mancat	i think khans will ahve goblins
2014-07-07 12:00:28	@mancat	on a related note: didn't someone important say that Khans has no living dragons left?
2014-07-07 12:00:34	Golem	yes
2014-07-07 12:00:38	Golem	BONE DRAAGGOONNSS
2014-07-07 12:00:52	@mancat	lol
2014-07-07 12:01:00	@dom	BOOOOONE STOOOOOORM?
2014-07-07 12:01:08	@mancat	there's some speculation that there will be a "thrun, the last dagon"
2014-07-07 12:01:09	Golem	ohgod
2014-07-07 12:01:10	@mancat	*dragon
2014-07-07 12:01:10	Golem	that right
2014-07-07 12:01:20	@mancat	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORM!!!!!!!!!!!!
2014-07-07 12:01:49	@dom	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORM
2014-07-07 12:02:24	@dom	twice a week, multiple times a fight, I heard that sound
2014-07-07 12:02:28	@dom	for a year and a half
2014-07-07 12:02:29	@dom	omg
2014-07-07 12:02:35	Golem	yup
2014-07-07 12:03:38	@relsqui	oh hey my neighbor's off the phone I could turn my fan off if I wanted
2014-07-07 12:03:49	@relsqui	downside of summer -> open window -> waking up listening to my neighbor's incredibly boring conversation in his back yard
2014-07-07 12:04:41	@mancat	lol
2014-07-07 12:07:39	@relsqui	but my fan's really loud, so.
2014-07-07 12:07:51	@relsqui	bluh I should call my insurance, I wish I could do more of this online
2014-07-07 12:08:22	@relsqui	nothing about what I wish to do or learn should require wasting another human's time
2014-07-07 12:08:33	@relsqui	they just haven't provided me with a useful interface to their computers so it does
2014-07-07 12:26:09	Golem	Hph

2014-07-09 14:27:04	@relsqui	karmabot: comp rules
2014-07-09 14:27:04	karmabot	Huh?
2014-07-09 14:27:08	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules)
2014-07-09 14:27:08	karmabot	comp rules(2): card abilities can take effect before you're done building the deck you're going to play it in (112.6m), you can't take something out of your graveyard unless it's in your graveyard (112.6k), also casting a card with an unpayable cost is legal; paying that cost is illegal (117.6), damage is generally detrimental to the object that receives it (119.1), creatures don't kill creatures. state kills creatures. (119.5), you may voluntarily 
2014-07-09 14:27:08	karmabot	120.4), when instructed to name a card, you have to name an actual Magic card. (201.3), just because it's flying in the picture doesn't mean it can necessarily fly (203.1), "truck" is not a valid creature subtype (yet) (205.3e), basically everything else is, though (205.3m), you can't use Redirect to make a counterspell target itself, but making it target the Redirect that's redirecting it is totally legit (114.4, 608.2k), if you manage to make an Au
2014-07-09 14:27:08	karmabot	will take it away and glare at you as a state-based action (303.4d)
2014-07-09 14:27:30	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is if the spell doesn't need targets you don't have to pick any (700.2c)
2014-07-09 14:27:30	karmabot	K, relsqui.
2014-07-09 14:27:53	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is you can't put one card in two piles (700.3a)
2014-07-09 14:27:53	karmabot	K, relsqui.
2014-07-09 14:28:49	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is nothing is a pile (700.3d)
2014-07-09 14:28:49	karmabot	Done, relsqui.
2014-07-09 14:31:07	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is stop hitting yourself! lol (701.10c)
2014-07-09 14:31:07	karmabot	Sure, relsqui.
2014-07-09 15:01:28	Golem	So you are adding ALL the comp rules to karmabot?
2014-07-09 15:04:11	@relsqui	no, just the ones I can rephrase amusingly
2014-07-09 15:04:17	Golem	heh
2014-07-09 15:21:09	@relsqui	oh, btw, I learned the other day that cockatrice doesn't handle DFCs :(
2014-07-09 15:33:58	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is if regeneration of a permanent is prevented, you can pay for it anyway if you want to (701.12c)
2014-07-09 15:33:58	karmabot	Okay, relsqui.
2014-07-09 15:35:26	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is you can't sacrifice someone else's creature (701.14a)
2014-07-09 15:35:26	karmabot	Alright, relsqui.
2014-07-09 15:58:50	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is templating is really important (701.15e)

2014-07-09 17:40:15	@relsqui	lol, basically
2014-07-09 17:40:20	@dom	I vote we buy every magic card and create a monopoly
2014-07-09 17:40:23	sabreman	well then i'll be able to read it when i gt back
2014-07-09 17:40:27	@dom	we do it one collector at a time
2014-07-09 17:40:33	sabreman	and provide my semi-worthelss opininon
2014-07-09 17:40:41	@dom	shhhh we already have a plan
2014-07-09 17:40:42	@relsqui	dom: I mean, we could just buy Wizards
2014-07-09 17:40:50	@dom	relsqui: I like the way you think!
2014-07-09 17:41:09	@dom	how are wizards going to help us with our assault on Wizards of the Coast though?
2014-07-09 17:41:14	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is shuffling an empy library is still shuffling it (701.16f)
2014-07-09 17:41:14	karmabot	Sure, relsqui.
2014-07-09 17:41:22	@dom	I mean, a company that big has antimagic bubbles at least
2014-07-09 17:41:33	@dom	not like force fields or anything, the blowy soap kind
2014-07-09 17:41:45	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules) is you can't tap something that's tapped (701.17a)
2014-07-09 17:41:45	karmabot	OK, relsqui.
2014-07-09 17:41:51	@dom	also, where are we gonna find wizards?
2014-07-09 17:43:28	@relsqui	reading the comp rules is making me really curious about planechase
2014-07-09 17:46:05	@relsqui	also: I always mix up populate and proliferate
2014-07-09 17:48:13	@relsqui	"a creature with toughness greater than 0 that's been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time SBAs were checked is destroyed as an SBA" ... also one with toughness NOT greater than 0, just for a different reason :P
2014-07-09 21:14:15	@mancat	relsqui: 701.17a is misleading, that only applies to costs paid
2014-07-09 21:14:20	@mancat	effects can tap tapped things just fine
2014-07-09 21:14:32	@mancat	well... i guess it
2014-07-09 21:14:40	@mancat	's more accurate to say they degrade gracefully
2014-07-09 21:14:46	@relsqui	heh, fair enough
2014-07-09 21:14:55	@mancat	they don't trigger "becomes patted" effects and stuff so i guess that's not technically true >_>
2014-07-09 21:14:59	@mancat	never mind
2014-07-09 21:15:01	@mancat	lol
2014-07-09 21:15:08	@mancat	*tapped
2014-07-09 21:15:17	@relsqui	mancat: corax and I got really excited after extrapolating from the double strike rules that if you give something first strike during the FS damage step, it won't deal damage at all
2014-07-09 21:15:23	@relsqui	but that's not actually true :(
2014-07-09 21:15:28	@mancat	wat, really?
2014-07-09 21:15:35	@mancat	man i never thought to try that
2014-07-09 21:15:37	@relsqui	you CAN prevent a double striker from dealing damage twice by taking away DS during the first combat damage step
2014-07-09 21:15:45	@mancat	i'd believe that
2014-07-09 21:15:54	@relsqui	but it doesn't work the same way oN FS
2014-07-09 21:16:06	@mancat	why not?
2014-07-09 21:16:11	@relsqui	there's an explicit rule about it
2014-07-09 21:16:18	@mancat	neat
2014-07-09 21:16:18	@relsqui	the rules literally say you can't is why
2014-07-09 21:16:26	@relsqui	which is good, because it works both ways
2014-07-09 21:16:29	@mancat	they think of everything, those coastal wizards
2014-07-09 21:16:33	@relsqui	you also can't take away FS to let a FS creature do damage twice
2014-07-09 21:16:38	@relsqui	which would otherwise be O_O
2014-07-09 21:16:41	@mancat	lol
2014-07-09 21:17:17	@relsqui	I was p. pleased with myself for working out the priority timing for how it would have to work, though :)
2014-07-09 21:17:21	@mancat	"have you seen my Sudden Spoiling -> doublestrike trick?"
2014-07-09 21:17:36	@mancat	that would be silly :P
2014-07-09 21:17:49	 *	relsqui grins
2014-07-09 21:17:59	@mancat	!card Ach, Hans, Run!
2014-07-09 21:17:59	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-09 21:18:07	@mancat	hi oracle :)
2014-07-09 21:18:17	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-07-09 21:18:21	@relsqui	it's Ach! Hans, anyway
2014-07-09 21:18:25	@relsqui	even if oracle could parse it >_>
2014-07-09 21:18:27	@relsqui	poor oracle
2014-07-09 21:18:28	 *	relsqui pats
2014-07-09 21:18:29	@mancat	lol
2014-07-09 21:18:38	@relsqui	mancat: I should write you a python one-liner you could plug into current oracle
2014-07-09 21:18:44	@relsqui	to deal with that while new oracle is in progress
2014-07-09 21:18:45	@mancat	some day i'll finish oracle v2...
2014-07-09 21:18:47	@mancat	but not today
2014-07-09 21:18:53	@mancat	right now i'm working on Indiana Jones bot
2014-07-09 21:19:00	 *	relsqui eyebrow
2014-07-09 21:19:33	@mancat	it does catacombs discovery :)
2014-07-09 21:19:33	@relsqui	... I remember we were speculating about names for a new bot but I forget what the bot was for
2014-07-09 21:19:38	@relsqui	ahahahahaha oh right
2014-07-09 21:19:39	@relsqui	perfect
2014-07-09 21:19:40	@relsqui	good job
2014-07-09 21:19:44	@mancat	:D i thought so too
2014-07-09 21:19:51	@mancat	i'm testing it in #catacombs-test
2014-07-09 21:19:54	@relsqui	that is 100% better than anything we came up with
2014-07-09 21:19:58	@relsqui	in that conversation
2014-07-09 21:19:59	@mancat	i'm trying to teach it enlighs-like syntax
2014-07-09 21:20:10	@relsqui	orly
2014-07-09 21:20:11	@mancat	basically i'm just writing a syntax tree with nested case statements
2014-07-09 21:20:14	@mancat	it's ugly, lol
2014-07-09 21:20:21	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-09 21:20:27	@mancat	but smarter than my other bots
2014-07-09 21:20:36	@relsqui	:)
2014-07-09 21:20:45	@relsqui	a smart UI and a little bit of randomness is all it takes to make a bot look brilliant
2014-07-09 21:21:12	@relsqui	also
2014-07-09 21:21:19	@relsqui	were we speculating that bart massey plays magic?
2014-07-09 21:21:23	@relsqui	because confirmed
2014-07-09 21:21:37	@mancat	i'd put more money on his having played D&D
2014-07-09 21:21:42	@mancat	really? :D
2014-07-09 21:21:51	@mancat	i bet he's good too
2014-07-09 21:21:53	@relsqui	I would be amazed if he hasn't played both
2014-07-09 21:22:18	@relsqui	he's not that into magic, not his favorite ccg :) spent some time telling me and corax about an old one he's a big fan of
2014-07-09 21:22:28	@mancat	which is that?
2014-07-09 21:22:31	@relsqui	but I invited him to club, obvs
2014-07-09 21:22:36	@mancat	gj
2014-07-09 21:22:39	@relsqui	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrunner
2014-07-09 21:22:43	@mancat	i know netrunner
2014-07-09 21:22:50	@mancat	i've only played it a few times, but it's pretty cool
2014-07-09 21:22:59	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-09 21:22:59	@mancat	i think there's a fairly deep metagame, but i don't really know it at all
2014-07-09 21:23:21	@mancat	seems to be really popular in the cs/it field
2014-07-09 21:23:27	@mancat	for reasons that are *completely* beyond me :P
2014-07-09 21:23:33	@mancat	it's a little predictable, imo
2014-07-09 21:23:38	@mancat	but whatever
2014-07-09 21:23:48	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-09 21:23:59	@relsqui	yeah, he was praising the simplicity and directness of its rules
2014-07-09 21:24:06	@relsqui	I was a li'l defensive on mtg's behalf :)
2014-07-09 21:24:15	@relsqui	relatedly, passed the halfway point in the comp rules! <_<
2014-07-09 21:24:57	@relsqui	I think I'm going to finish the first pass without worrying too much about retention and then go back and actually take notes
2014-07-09 21:25:21	@relsqui	since that was clearly a good idea and I'm not already doing it
2014-07-09 21:25:31	@relsqui	and I don't want to either start halfway through or start over before I finish -_-
2014-07-09 21:26:59	 *	relsqui : learning through stubbornness
2014-07-09 21:28:06	@mancat	seems like a good system to me
2014-07-09 21:28:18	@relsqui	it would :P
2014-07-09 21:28:20	@mancat	also i would love to play magic with bart massey, lol
2014-07-09 21:28:24	@relsqui	right?
2014-07-09 21:28:31	@relsqui	no part of that doesn't sound fun
2014-07-09 21:28:33	 *	mancat wonders what kind of deck he plays
2014-07-09 21:28:43	@mancat	so
2014-07-09 21:28:58	@relsqui	iirc he said he has a friend who's a judge, who'll bring promo stuff to a game night sometimes and play
2014-07-09 21:29:03	@relsqui	he doesn't play actively and doesn't build
2014-07-09 21:29:23	@mancat	if we do end up joining WPN i think i'll have to recertify to L1
2014-07-09 21:29:23	@relsqui	oh right I was going to look up the judge, what was his name ...
2014-07-09 21:29:29	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-09 21:29:38	@relsqui	... I still sorta wanna do that. it's on a back burner, but.
2014-07-09 21:29:54	@mancat	cuz if we're going to be running our own FNM there's basically no excuse not to judge it :P
2014-07-09 21:29:57	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-09 21:29:58	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-09 21:30:09	@mancat	i think it's probably smart not to try to do it before fall term is voer
2014-07-09 21:30:16	@relsqui	I wonder if there's a level above "can run sanctioned events" and below "has to run FNM"
2014-07-09 21:30:29	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-09 21:30:38	@mancat	we could check, but i'm fairly sure "run FNM" is like a core requirement
2014-07-09 21:30:51	@mancat	it's one of Wizards' primary promotional tools i think
2014-07-09 21:31:10	@mancat	an internationally-standardized syndicated event that can be found everywhere and played by anyone
2014-07-09 21:31:19	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-09 21:31:45	@relsqui	maybe we could team up with TV and run things bigger than they can? we have access to more space without paying for it
2014-07-09 21:32:02	@mancat	hmmm
2014-07-09 21:32:04	@mancat	that is true
2014-07-09 21:32:17	@mancat	i mean, they have pretty good space for a store their size
2014-07-09 21:32:20	@mancat	i'm not sure thye need the space
2014-07-09 21:32:21	@relsqui	yeah.
2014-07-09 21:32:26	@relsqui	I'unno man :)
2014-07-09 21:32:30	@mancat	but they might if they ever run a GPT or something
2014-07-09 21:32:46	@relsqui	I mean, maybe they'd also just be interested in hooking up with us for an event on campus in return for being able to sell shit at it
2014-07-09 21:32:51	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-09 21:32:55	@mancat	that seems possible
2014-07-09 21:33:02	@mancat	i think it's worth looking into at any rate
2014-07-09 21:33:32	 *	mancat tries to iced tea, gets lukewarm tea instead
2014-07-09 21:33:42	 *	mancat drinks it anyway
2014-07-09 21:33:48	@relsqui	heh
2014-07-09 21:33:49	@relsqui	too soon
2014-07-09 21:33:56	@relsqui	... oh, lol
2014-07-09 21:34:05	@relsqui	found an nmccoy
2014-07-09 21:34:14	@relsqui	skimming local humans in the judge portal :)
2014-07-09 21:34:46	@mancat	lol nice
2014-07-09 21:35:21	@relsqui	.... are there no judges in portland, maine?! I just put in portland out of laziness and they're all oregon
2014-07-09 21:35:30	@relsqui	that can't possibly be true
2014-07-09 21:36:58	 *	relsqui headscratch
2014-07-09 21:37:22	@relsqui	huh
2014-07-09 21:37:46	@relsqui	mancat: I wonder if Dot would logo us a logo under a one-time contract :) and if that's a valid use of our funds, lol
2014-07-09 21:39:58	@mancat	pretty sure contracts for service are a thing we cna do
2014-07-09 21:40:04	@mancat	and that sounds like a good deal to me if she's down
2014-07-09 21:40:24	@relsqui	yeah, logistically we can, more of a question of purpose :)
2014-07-09 21:40:59	@relsqui	like, can we justify it as an expense
2014-07-09 21:41:31	@mancat	i guess we'd better find out
2014-07-09 21:41:34	@mancat	seems valid to me
2014-07-09 21:46:21	@dom	wut is wpn and why are we doing a hostile takeover of them
2014-07-10 08:24:23	Corax	corollary to the doublestrike fun: if you remove doublestrike, is it normal strike ('contains first strike') or first strike now? ('implies first strike')
2014-07-10 08:24:39	Corax	my feeling is the former.
2014-07-10 08:32:22	 *	relsqui confused by the question, will try again after a shower and with the rules in front of them again
2014-07-10 11:46:54	@mancat	Corax: the former
2014-07-10 11:47:06	 *	relsqui more awake now, can make sense of the question and agrees
2014-07-10 11:47:14	@relsqui	and now I wanna read comp rules but I should wooooork
2014-07-10 11:47:15	 *	relsqui fidget
2014-07-10 11:47:32	@relsqui	rob told warren I'd send him the handout when I was done with it, which is extremely reasonable, but now it's also going to be very conspicuous that I'm not finishing it until the last minute, lol;
2014-07-10 11:47:39	@relsqui	s/;/./
2014-07-10 11:47:44	 *	mancat can't actually think of basically any way to remove doublestrike without removing all keywords froma  creature
2014-07-10 11:48:03	@relsqui	huh, yeah
2014-07-10 11:51:04	@relsqui	obviously we need a card that's like s/creature type/ability keyword/ on !card artificial evolution
2014-07-10 11:51:04	oracle	Instant, U (1)
2014-07-10 11:51:04	oracle	Change the text of target spell or permanent by replacing all instances of one creature type with another. The new creature type can't be Wall. (This effect lasts indefinitely.)
2014-07-10 11:51:10	@relsqui	(that was hard to phrase in a way that let me put the card name at the end, lol)
2014-07-10 12:20:42	@relsqui	hey, anyone need an excuse to go to time vault?
2014-07-10 12:20:49	@relsqui	I wanna know if they'll accept a PSU purchase order :)

2014-07-10 17:41:55	@dom	oi! maybe she wants to play too, you don't know
2014-07-10 17:43:03	@relsqui	oh, sure, I'm not saying it's not also the other thing
2014-07-10 17:43:10	@relsqui	but I'm p. sure that's why she knows about the club
2014-07-10 17:49:38	@dom	likely
2014-07-10 19:04:37	@mancat	lol i had decided it was an abbreviation for "meeting"
2014-07-10 19:05:14	@relsqui	oh, haha
2014-07-10 19:05:23	@relsqui	that might actually also be true

2014-07-13 17:04:12	@mancat	i think that thread collectively missed the point, that this isn't about making good cards but funny ones
2014-07-13 17:04:18	@relsqui	yes
2014-07-13 17:04:22	@relsqui	but the rest of the replies are good
2014-07-13 17:06:20	@relsqui	it's really tempting to template these up and make a tumblr or something

2014-07-13 17:27:18	@mancat	come to think of it, LSV might not have a hyphenated last name
2014-07-13 17:27:26	@mancat	maybe they just start using your middle name when you get really good
2014-07-13 17:27:26	@relsqui	(jokes which I assume have been made a lot already)

2014-07-13 17:28:47	@mancat	Tristan Shaun Gregson was pretty famous around San Jose, and then he got fired from Channel Fireball and excommunicated from the local community because he was stealing from the store where he worked and reselling cards on the ebays
2014-07-13 17:28:52	@mancat	what a jerk...

2014-07-13 17:29:53	@relsqui	:(
2014-07-13 17:30:21	@mancat	you might have picked up on this, but apparently the new standing policy about letting people play their promo cards at release tournaments is why the promos for M15 suck so much
2014-07-13 17:30:44	@mancat	no one wants to play a format where everyone gets to play !card Wormcoil Engine
2014-07-13 17:30:44	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-13 17:30:48	@mancat	:(

2014-07-13 17:30:54	@mancat	that one
2014-07-13 17:31:09	@mancat	but it's shitty
2014-07-13 17:31:18	@mancat	i would rather have good promos that i can't play at the prerelease
2014-07-13 17:31:24	@relsqui	ohh
2014-07-13 17:31:27	 *	mancat is less interested in going to release events now
2014-07-13 17:31:33	@relsqui	no, I didn't, makes sense though
2014-07-13 17:31:51	@relsqui	also makes sense with the variety
2014-07-13 17:31:58	 *	mancat thinks he can find a home for the bounce clone in an EDH deck, but just barely
2014-07-13 17:32:00	@relsqui	... what previously was the reason that you couldn't?
2014-07-13 17:32:15	@mancat	they were too strong, they didn't want that kind of power in the tournament
2014-07-13 17:32:19	@mancat	plus there used to be only one promo
2014-07-13 17:32:39	@mancat	so it would basically be "whoever draws their promo first wins"
2014-07-13 17:32:41	@mancat	which is stupid
2014-07-13 17:32:57	@mancat	and when it's a mono-colored promo, everyone would be playing that color
2014-07-13 17:33:09	@relsqui	oh, got it
2014-07-13 17:33:11	@relsqui	that makes sense
2014-07-13 17:33:15	@relsqui	...
2014-07-13 17:33:19	@relsqui	I've said that like three times in the last 5m
2014-07-13 17:33:20	 *	relsqui stops
2014-07-13 17:33:35	@mancat	on top of the fact that i dislike sealed a lot, geting shitty promos is pretty lame
2014-07-13 17:33:42	 *	mancat will probably not be going to any more prereleases
2014-07-13 17:34:48	@relsqui	aw

2014-07-13 17:52:45	@relsqui	also, is prerelease always sealed?
2014-07-13 17:59:02	@dom	luis scott-vargas is correct
2014-07-13 17:59:16	@dom	or well, thats his correct last name

2014-07-13 18:10:32	@dom	prevents damage done to you by your spells or abilities?
2014-07-13 18:10:37	@dom	like prventing friendly fire

2014-07-13 18:11:32	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-13 22:31:37	@relsqui	Q: Can I control both Avacyn, Angel of Hope and Avacyn, Guardian Angel at the same time?
2014-07-13 22:31:40	@relsqui	A: Sure, that's no problem. Unlike the planeswalker uniqueness rule, which looks at the planeswalker type, the legend rule looks at the card's full name. The cards share only part of their name, and even though they represent the same storyline character, the game doesn't have a problem with this. Any awkwardness of meeting their alternate selves is up to the two Avacyns to work out amongst themselves.
2014-07-13 22:31:46	@relsqui	^ lol
2014-07-13 22:33:27	@relsqui	oh, whoa, clever
2014-07-13 22:33:35	@relsqui	I won't paste the whole thing but there's some neat sliver stuff in cranial insertion today
2014-07-13 23:01:51	 *	mancat brewed a pretty vicious goblin deck
2014-07-13 23:02:03	 *	mancat then managed to click something that completely blew up forge's UI
2014-07-13 23:02:19	@mancat	(which seems to defy repair, because forge's UI customization blows chunks)

2014-07-15 02:06:54	 *	relsqui single tear
2014-07-15 02:18:53	@relsqui	heh someone suggested drafting conspiracy/unhinged/unglued
2014-07-15 02:18:56	@relsqui	that would be amazing
2014-07-15 02:18:58	@relsqui	and incredibly expensive
2014-07-15 02:33:01	@relsqui	:O I missed that hot soup was james ernest
2014-07-15 02:33:07	@relsqui	now I want one
2014-07-15 12:30:11	@mancat	did elspeth die or something?
2014-07-15 12:32:10	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-15 12:32:13	@relsqui	well
2014-07-15 12:32:13	@relsqui	sort of
2014-07-15 12:32:19	@relsqui	she died insofar as death is meaningful in theros
2014-07-15 12:32:28	@relsqui	so she exists in its underworld
2014-07-15 12:32:31	@relsqui	we have probably not seen the last of her.
2014-07-15 12:32:57	@relsqui	iirc she traded herself for ... I forget his name. someone she wanted to save, who had died.

2014-07-15 12:43:47	@dom	sucks to suck
2014-07-15 12:43:52	@dom	xenagos 2016
2014-07-15 12:45:09	@relsqui	pshht
2014-07-15 12:45:16	@relsqui	nah he's still dead
2014-07-15 12:46:27	@relsqui	but at the revel where he ascended, he came to elspeth while she was asleep with daxos and caused her to remember her last few moments on mirrodin
2014-07-15 12:46:34	@relsqui	about to get killed by the phyrexian obliterator
2014-07-15 12:46:41	@relsqui	she lashes out, kills it in her dream, wakes up, has killed daxos
2014-07-15 12:47:11	@relsqui	which is why (apart from love) she takes responsibility for saving him after she's done dispatching xenagos
2014-07-15 12:48:52	@relsqui	ajani objected but couldn't stop her, so he got to watch her die instead
2014-07-15 12:48:59	@relsqui	... and is now wearing her cloak, apparently
2014-07-15 12:49:00	@relsqui	hence single tear
2014-07-15 12:51:00	@dom	yah theres a couple card tie ins
2014-07-15 12:51:14	@dom	like ajani wearing her cloak in a reprint I think
2014-07-15 12:51:25	@dom	and remember the fallen, where its just ajani holding her cloak
2014-07-15 12:51:46	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-15 12:51:53	@relsqui	whoa, daxos is a badass http://magiccards.info/ths/en/191.html

2014-07-15 12:56:32	Golem	his card is solid
2014-07-15 12:56:38	Golem	but it hasnt seen much play sadly
2014-07-15 14:20:36	Golem	BAH
2014-07-15 14:20:38	Golem	ok
2014-07-15 14:20:39	Golem	this is silly.
2014-07-15 14:21:00	Golem	In the ENTIRETY of m15, there are exactly 2 green creatures with trample.
2014-07-15 14:21:10	@dom	01 of 20

2014-07-15 14:22:14	Golem	if we want to be VERY generous the new green lord can give creatures trample.
2014-07-15 14:22:16	@relsqui	I dig the art on siege wurm
2014-07-15 14:22:24	 *	relsqui pulled a copule
2014-07-15 14:22:26	Golem	but im not that generous
2014-07-15 14:22:30	@relsqui	Golem: arguably so can nissa but not the way you mean >_>
2014-07-15 14:22:32	Golem	Siege wurm is great in limited
2014-07-15 14:22:38	Golem	yeah she makes lands with trample
2014-07-15 14:22:39	Golem	but
2014-07-15 14:22:40	Golem	no
2014-07-15 14:23:18	Golem	I never like the idea of making lands creatures, because creatures die ;p
2014-07-15 14:23:26	Golem	its like getting 2 for 1ned
2014-07-15 14:23:38	@relsqui	yeah, I know what you mean
2014-07-15 14:23:43	@relsqui	it's a thing to do when you can kick ass with it, really
2014-07-15 14:23:59	@dom	yeah, muta-vaulting it
2014-07-15 14:24:03	Golem	Although I have seen people online ALREADY including darksteel citidel in their green devotion decks so they can make indistructable 4/4s with nissa

2014-07-15 14:24:37	Golem	not sure if its worth the potential mana screw
2014-07-15 14:24:40	Golem	but its cute
2014-07-15 14:24:43	@dom	true
2014-07-15 14:24:54	@dom	idk if you're doing green devotion
2014-07-15 14:24:59	@dom	you probably have fine mana
2014-07-15 14:25:27	Golem	yar
2014-07-15 14:25:43	Golem	but in that case is it better than running more mutavaults/nykthoses?
2014-07-15 14:25:47	Golem	I cant say
2014-07-15 14:25:55	Golem	I suppose it depends on how often you get nissa
2014-07-15 14:25:55	@dom	yeah I can see the argument
2014-07-15 14:26:19	Golem	the thing with tdevotion is that you have to be very devoted to that color
2014-07-15 14:26:24	@dom	yah
2014-07-15 14:26:30	Golem	that means stuff like GGG and GG on curve
2014-07-15 14:26:31	@relsqui	well ... yeah
2014-07-15 14:26:33	@relsqui	that's what that means XD
2014-07-15 14:26:37	Golem	;p
2014-07-15 14:26:47	Golem	you know what I meant when I said what I mean
2014-07-15 14:27:35	@dom	i mean theres also a lot of "play-extra-lands" in green
2014-07-15 14:27:49	@dom	and it wouldn't be out of flavor if you're using nissa to win via land
2014-07-15 14:27:53	Golem	yup
2014-07-15 14:28:06	Golem	There is a strategy there worth exploring
2014-07-15 14:28:24	Golem	just not sure how good it is when lifebane zombie and thoughtsieze and hero's downfall are still around
2014-07-15 14:28:53	@relsqui	dom: oh shit
2014-07-15 14:28:54	@relsqui	nissa

2014-07-15 14:29:13	@dom	oh man you're right
2014-07-15 14:29:17	Golem	I will say this
2014-07-15 14:29:21	Golem	been playing aroudn with her
2014-07-15 14:29:29	Golem	and Nissa+Genesis Hydra work well together
2014-07-15 14:29:33	@dom	actually no I can't really use it well
2014-07-15 14:29:50	@dom	maybe as a general yeah
2014-07-15 14:29:52	@relsqui	>_< I hate that magiccards.info doesn't update until actual release
2014-07-15 14:29:54	@relsqui	I want m15 :(
2014-07-15 14:29:57	@dom	but my deck isn't anything right now
2014-07-15 14:30:06	@dom	its just white and green cards and kalametra
2014-07-15 14:30:15	@relsqui	well, okay
2014-07-15 14:30:19	@relsqui	you *could* make one
2014-07-15 14:30:22	@dom	yes
2014-07-15 14:30:46	@relsqui	ooh and then play the land-fetching creatures
2014-07-15 14:30:54	@relsqui	yavimaya elder, etc.
2014-07-15 14:31:00	@relsqui	karametra basically doubles them
2014-07-15 14:31:48	@dom	well I mean nissa's ult is the lands that she fetches
2014-07-15 14:32:07	@relsqui	yeah. also you have no defense in the meantime. hmm
2014-07-15 14:32:09	@dom	I mean I can buff a couple lands with her +1 but at the end of the day, she isn't going to be living that long
2014-07-15 14:32:18	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-15 14:32:29	@dom	realistically, the best way to do it is have a bunch of ramp and nissa as general
2014-07-15 14:32:37	@dom	and focus on getting her out like turn 3 or 4
2014-07-15 14:32:57	Golem	brb
2014-07-15 14:33:01	@dom	and then +1 ing her to ult status while also having a lot of big swingers
2014-07-15 14:33:20	@dom	the problem would be running into "my hand is full of hydras, and I really want an elvish mystic"
2014-07-15 14:33:30	@dom	and green doesn't have a tooooon of card draw
2014-07-15 14:33:30	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-15 14:33:52	@dom	I could run courser from theros
2014-07-15 14:33:56	@dom	I forget its whole name
2014-07-15 14:34:17	@relsqui	courser of kruphix

2014-07-15 14:34:39	@dom	well I need a bunch of things like it too
2014-07-15 14:35:01	@dom	afaik, courser is pretty much the closest thing green has to card draw

2014-07-15 14:56:49	Golem	The best part was it was "play a card"

2014-07-15 14:56:53	Golem	so your lands drew you cards
2014-07-15 14:56:53	@relsqui	so it includes lands
2014-07-15 14:56:57	@relsqui	I noticed that.
2014-07-15 15:41:36	@dom	relsqui: I want card draw because without card draw edh feels like shit
2014-07-15 15:42:11	@dom	no card draw is only good in an aggro deck I feel like, where you can win before you need more than topdecking >>
2014-07-15 17:57:34	@dom	what room? basement land?
2014-07-15 18:01:26	@relsqui	dom: no, 323

2014-07-16 01:12:01	@relsqui	When building the crew, we tended to think of the Weatherlight kind of like the Enterprise so we made sure to include the appropriate archetypes: the captain (Sisay), first officer (Gerrard), lead engineer (Sisay), doctor (Orim), security (Tahngarth), science officer (Ertai) and someone to constantly get in trouble (Squee). : )
2014-07-16 01:12:06	@relsqui	Happy Birthday!

2014-07-16 12:03:34	@relsqui	lol, successful tactical deployment of planeswalker slash. linked to ellen like I said I would, joking that it was to encourage her to keep playing
2014-07-16 12:04:02	@relsqui	and our friend ada was like "... I am encouraged to keep playing and I haven't started yet"
2014-07-16 12:04:28	@relsqui	someone else, in response to the observation that the artist has done actual card art for the characters, was like "so that makes it canon, right?"

2014-07-17 11:22:40	@dom	well, with mogg war marshal, if I have a lord on the field, I can swing for an extra 1 or 2 damage
2014-07-17 11:23:17	@dom	if I don't have a lord, I can still cheat in war marshal with lackey for a free 2 goblins
2014-07-17 11:23:33	@dom	I mean, that would be a bad play, but if I have no other goblins in hand
2014-07-17 11:23:34	Golem	you cant play mog war marshal because of the format?
2014-07-17 11:23:53	@dom	golem: im not limiting myself to a format, should I be?
2014-07-17 11:23:55	Golem	also you can flash back command with snapcaster

2014-07-17 11:24:48	@mancat	things that leverage sorceris is probably the only real reason
2014-07-17 11:24:54	@dom	OK
2014-07-17 11:25:05	@mancat	or things that address creature spells: !card remove soul

2014-07-17 11:25:12	Golem	the real question is, if you are playing casual goblins, why are you not playing both?
2014-07-17 11:25:21	@mancat	though realisticall if you're facing Remove Soul in Goblins they're stupid to use it on your token-maker so it's probably not relevant
2014-07-17 11:25:54	@mancat	also the eal, REAL question is why he hella re you playig either instead of !card Mogg Alarm
2014-07-17 11:25:54	oracle	Sorcery, 1RR (3)
2014-07-17 11:25:54	oracle	You may sacrifice two Mountains rather than pay Mogg Alarm's mana cost.

2014-07-17 11:26:36	@dom	well I can search for mogg war marshal with matron if I actually need it
2014-07-17 11:26:42	@dom	thats about my only reason
2014-07-17 11:26:47	Golem	also, aquire more goblin lackies
2014-07-17 11:26:52	@mancat	mogg war marshal is not a card you're ever goig to need to tuor for
2014-07-17 11:26:53	@mancat	guaranteed
2014-07-17 11:27:02	@mancat	if you're using goblin matron you should be finding like

2014-07-17 11:27:57	@dom	starts with lackey I think
2014-07-17 11:27:58	@mancat	you should play 1 or 2 as an emergenc measue if you're playing goblin matron
2014-07-17 11:28:01	@dom	OK
2014-07-17 11:28:31	@mancat	because if they get a 5/5 or a po red guy down or something and you can't swing through, siege gang commander can finish off the last of their health
2014-07-17 11:28:38	@mancat	alternatively, so can goblin grenade, but you can't tutor that
2014-07-17 11:28:45	@mancat	at least not with goblin matron

2014-07-17 11:36:39	@dom	although I was only doing it like that to go against you two >>
2014-07-17 11:36:43	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-17 11:36:47	@relsqui	I only just switched to the other thing
2014-07-17 11:36:53	@relsqui	because people I expected to know better than me were using it
2014-07-17 11:36:56	 *	relsqui switches back
2014-07-17 11:49:29	 *	mancat pronounces it the R&D way
2014-07-17 11:54:33	@relsqui	yeah, that was my first instinct
2014-07-17 11:54:47	@relsqui	because that's what I get when I apply that spelling to english phonology
2014-07-17 11:54:52	@relsqui	but apparently other people get another thing
2014-07-17 11:55:26	@dom	weird
2014-07-17 11:55:49	@dom	I keep wanting to figure out a way for kiki-jiki to work in this deck, but I don't think this is the right deck for it
2014-07-17 11:56:01	@relsqui	(someone in the comments said something about sticking to bolas's pronunciation. curious what the context is for that.)
2014-07-17 11:56:18	@relsqui	(someone else in the comments was like "you know when the creator of gif said it's pronounced jif and we didn't listen to that either)
2014-07-17 11:56:22	@relsqui	"
2014-07-17 11:56:50	@dom	well thats because its pronounced gif
2014-07-17 11:56:55	@dom	jif is peanut butter
2014-07-17 11:57:01	@dom	gif is love, gif is life
2014-07-17 11:57:09	@relsqui	yeah that debate makes me just not want to say words out loud sometimes
2014-07-17 11:57:31	@dom	or doge? obviously d-oh-g
2014-07-17 11:57:35	@relsqui	because I don't want to get in a bullshit argument about how I said something instead of them hearing what I said
2014-07-17 11:57:39	@relsqui	dom: that one I agree with
2014-07-17 11:57:42	@dom	but its an internet meme, so who cares
2014-07-17 11:57:46	@relsqui	also that.
2014-07-17 11:57:58	@relsqui	it's kind of in the spirit of doge to be inconsistent in that way anyway
2014-07-17 11:58:03	@dom	yeah
2014-07-17 11:58:25	@dom	I think the problem is that internet acronyms are becoming words that mean the same thing
2014-07-17 11:58:52	@dom	ex: rofl (raw-fl) means same thing as laughing
2014-07-17 11:59:24	@dom	I mean its not even acronyms, now that I think of it
2014-07-17 11:59:33	@dom	probably started way before that with stuff like asap

2014-07-23 14:46:58	@relsqui	interesting
2014-07-23 14:47:17	@relsqui	my instinct is ... yes but you'd go by the morphed characteristics?
2014-07-23 14:47:19	@relsqui	that's a weird on.e
2014-07-23 14:47:31	@dom	well the morphed characteristics is "creature"
2014-07-23 14:47:40	@relsqui	oh, yeah
2014-07-23 14:47:43	@relsqui	so it'd just be some creature

2014-07-23 15:00:30	@dom	I guess a lot of people just don't want others to get emrakul that easily
2014-07-23 15:01:07	NMcCoy	there's a rules thing to perplex you - what happens if you cast Ertai's Meddling on a morph-cast Zoetic Cavern? ;)
2014-07-23 15:01:48	@dom	well you're casting it as a creature since its morphed, so I'd say it can be delayed
2014-07-23 15:02:01	NMcCoy	well, yes
2014-07-23 15:02:02	@dom	as opposed to it being a land, which would mean it can't be
2014-07-23 15:02:11	NMcCoy	and then what happens when it resolves?
2014-07-23 15:02:18	NMcCoy	the meddling, I mean
2014-07-23 15:02:42	@dom	it comes into play as a morphed creature?
2014-07-23 15:02:45	NMcCoy	remember that cards in the exile zone are face-up unless they get exiled face-down
2014-07-23 15:03:10	@dom	wouldn't it get exiled face down?
2014-07-23 15:03:13	NMcCoy	no
2014-07-23 15:03:21	NMcCoy	ertai's meddling doesn't say "exiles it face down"
2014-07-23 15:03:22	@dom	hmmm very interesting
2014-07-23 15:03:32	@dom	but the card itself its exiling is face down
2014-07-23 15:03:42	@dom	but rules is exile face up unless noted?
2014-07-23 15:03:58	NMcCoy	if you Swords to Plowshares a face-down creature, it's exiled face-ip

2014-07-23 15:05:46	NMcCoy	anyway
2014-07-23 15:05:50	@dom	anyways, I think zoetic caverns is in exile zone face up, but then it comes into play at end of meddling as a face down morph
2014-07-23 15:05:58	NMcCoy	not quite
2014-07-23 15:06:04	NMcCoy	card state is not a copiable trait
2014-07-23 15:06:22	@dom	but the meddling says as a copy of the original spell
2014-07-23 15:06:28	NMcCoy	indeed it does
2014-07-23 15:06:32	@dom	the original spell was playing a face down morph, yeah?
2014-07-23 15:06:40	NMcCoy	but "face down" is not a copiable property of a spell
2014-07-23 15:06:55	@dom	so its a 2/2 token?
2014-07-23 15:06:59	NMcCoy	no, it's a card
2014-07-23 15:07:04	@dom	2/2 card?
2014-07-23 15:07:18	NMcCoy	it is a face up Zoetic Caverns card that is a 2/2 creature with no text
2014-07-23 15:07:24	@dom	lol
2014-07-23 15:07:42	NMcCoy	also, probably the only time ever that you will see a land card on the stack

2014-07-23 15:11:09	NMcCoy	you target it with Clarion Ultimatum

2014-07-23 15:20:14	NMcCoy	(rather than just a refusal on principle to play the game)
2014-07-23 15:20:22	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-23 15:20:30	@relsqui	I'm not sure I have a principle against playing your games
2014-07-23 15:20:36	@relsqui	but I am really grouchy and not making any promises for anything right now
2014-07-23 15:20:40	NMcCoy	also fair

2014-07-23 15:21:37	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-23 15:21:57	NMcCoy	it's urd, oracle is just being persnickety
2014-07-23 15:22:45	NMcCoy	I am surprised it's so cheap/low-rated
2014-07-23 15:22:53	NMcCoy	it is very going into my future Kemba deck
2014-07-23 22:16:04	@relsqui	"
2014-07-23 22:16:05	@relsqui	You live in the future: designs years ahead, records podcast months ahead and now writes articles weeks ahead. Can you tell at least if the SDCC went well?"
2014-07-23 22:16:08	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-23 22:18:14	@relsqui	"I'm trying to teach a friend to play Magic. Any advice for them?" "Remember it's more important that they have a good time than they learn everything in the first game."
2014-07-23 22:18:18	@relsqui	a) that's really good advice
2014-07-23 22:18:22	@relsqui	b) I totally played with Kendall today 8)
2014-07-23 22:18:25	@relsqui	and I'm p. sure he had a good time
2014-07-23 22:49:20	@relsqui	I got a 2014 booster battle pack, which is two 22-card minidecks and two boosters
2014-07-23 22:49:30	@relsqui	so each player opens a booster, puts up to five cards from it into the deck
2014-07-23 22:49:33	@relsqui	and you play with that
2014-07-23 22:49:35	@relsqui	lands included
2014-07-23 22:50:57	@dom	that sounds fun
2014-07-23 22:51:08	@relsqui	yeah, it seemed like a good idea
2014-07-23 22:51:15	@relsqui	not too expensive, either! ten bucks
2014-07-23 22:51:25	@relsqui	(I sold my foil chord of calling and master of the feast to TV)
2014-07-23 22:51:34	@relsqui	also whoever was cynically making bets with me about how much I'd get for them, I win
2014-07-23 22:51:37	@relsqui	was $22.50 for the pair
2014-07-23 22:52:09	@relsqui	(in credit)
2014-07-23 22:52:48	@dom	nice :D
2014-07-23 22:52:52	@dom	it was me for the record
2014-07-23 22:53:09	@relsqui	I was pretty sure it was you
2014-07-23 22:53:13	@dom	I mean, I wouldn't put it past mancat either
2014-07-23 22:53:15	@relsqui	but only mostly
2014-07-23 22:53:15	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-23 22:53:19	@relsqui	nah, it was between you and pash
2014-07-23 22:53:21	@dom	but that conversation was one we had
2014-07-23 22:53:58	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-23 23:41:29	@mancat	NMcCoy++ nice rules trivia
2014-07-23 23:43:03	NMcCoy	:)
2014-07-23 23:43:43	 *	mancat eats his brussels sprouts
2014-07-23 23:44:55	@relsqui	mm
2014-07-23 23:45:10	@relsqui	I didn't get brussels sprouts until a friend made them for thanksgiving
2014-07-23 23:45:11	@relsqui	perfectly.
2014-07-23 23:45:32	@relsqui	mancat: did you see I got kendall to play? :D I am pleased, I've been kind of quietly trying to do that for a while, lol
2014-07-23 23:45:35	 *	mancat makes pretty good brussels sprouts
2014-07-23 23:45:39	@relsqui	he was like "<_< so ... you guys meet on tuesdays?"
2014-07-23 23:45:40	@mancat	i did :D good job
2014-07-23 23:46:28	@relsqui	also (while not a total newbie, he'd played before just not in years) he picked it up really fast, surprising literally no one
2014-07-23 23:47:20	@relsqui	not like "I understand the flow of a turn" but like "oh so you're better off saving your deathtouch creature to defend with"
2014-07-23 23:51:18	@relsqui	mancat: oh, also, was talking to time vault guys about event hosting; neither of us actually knew how it would work if we wanted to team up to do something on campus, but they're very enthusiastic about getting involved
2014-07-23 23:52:48	@relsqui	didn't commit us to anything but have an email to email
2014-07-23 23:54:22	@relsqui	huh, interesting
2014-07-23 23:54:38	@relsqui	if I sort my cards ascending by name or descending by market value, the same card is on top
2014-07-23 23:55:40	@mancat	interesting
2014-07-23 23:55:46	@mancat	anyway that's cool
2014-07-23 23:56:14	@mancat	i was thinking about mentioning it the last time we were there but by the time we were done i was not in a good mood to talk business
2014-07-23 23:56:32	 *	mancat finishes brussels
2014-07-23 23:56:36	@mancat	slightly overcooked :\
2014-07-23 23:56:47	@relsqui	aw
2014-07-23 23:56:52	@dom	decrement your standards variable
2014-07-23 23:56:55	@mancat	still pretty good though
2014-07-23 23:56:57	@relsqui	lol

2014-07-23 23:57:14	@dom	:)
2014-07-23 23:57:14	@mancat	(i named my standards variable dom)
2014-07-23 23:57:18	@dom	bahahahaha
2014-07-23 23:57:25	@dom	it makes a good benchmark
2014-07-23 23:57:28	@mancat	:P
2014-07-23 23:57:33	@dom	like initializing to zero
2014-07-23 23:57:38	@mancat	like subway and gray ogre?
2014-07-23 23:57:39	@relsqui	mancat: re the price/name ... that's after selling the foil chord, obviously <_<
2014-07-23 23:57:40	@dom	standards dom = dom;
2014-07-23 23:57:56	@mancat	lol yeah that would throw it off
2014-07-23 23:58:10	@relsqui	it's easier to sell foil cards than non-foils
2014-07-23 23:58:20	@relsqui	because if I decide I want the card, I can buy a non-foil and I haven't lost money
2014-07-23 23:58:40	@relsqui	I mean, I haven't wasted it by selling it
2014-07-23 23:59:08	@relsqui	dom: fwiw the conspiracy card I was thinking of yesterday was this one http://magiccards.info/vma/en/254.html
2014-07-23 23:59:57	@dom	hmmmm
2014-07-23 23:59:58	@dom	hmmm
2014-07-24 00:00:05	@dom	that would be a good commander methinks
2014-07-24 00:01:05	@dom	you'd probably need a lot of land tutors so you could get the lands before they were exiled
2014-07-24 00:01:13	@dom	or mana rocks, but thats edh
2014-07-24 00:02:27	@mancat	exiling cards at random from your deck doesn't hurt your mana consistency
2014-07-24 00:02:49	@mancat	if you mill half your deck, the remaining half stull has the same rati of lands to non-lands on average
2014-07-24 00:02:54	@dom	sure
2014-07-24 00:03:03	@dom	but less lands in deck means more creatures
2014-07-24 00:03:10	@dom	if all your lands are on the field
2014-07-24 00:03:12	@dom	well.
2014-07-24 00:03:18	@mancat	oh i see
2014-07-24 00:03:19	@mancat	lol
2014-07-24 00:03:26	@dom	lolo
2014-07-24 00:03:29	@dom	kek
2014-07-24 00:03:30	@mancat	yeah well he's not green so that's not gonna work for EDH
2014-07-24 00:03:30	@relsqui	also, wait, where does exiling come into it?
2014-07-24 00:03:33	@mancat	but i see your point
2014-07-24 00:03:50	@mancat	s/exile/effect that removes cards from your library/
2014-07-24 00:04:04	@dom	luckily its b so gy is not exile zone
2014-07-24 00:04:13	@dom	but still rather have lands on field than in gy
2014-07-24 00:04:47	@relsqui	dom: you could just let the lands go into your graveyard and then play, um

2014-07-24 00:06:10	@dom	(make it illegal)
2014-07-24 00:06:17	@relsqui	wrong colors for edh but not for constructed

2014-07-24 00:19:32	@mancat	old thoughtsieze art much better than new
2014-07-24 00:19:44	@mancat	relsqui: name colors, not guilds. much easier
2014-07-24 00:19:45	@dom	agree
2014-07-24 00:19:50	@relsqui	this way more interesting
2014-07-24 00:19:53	@mancat	should be four lands for each color
2014-07-24 00:19:57	@mancat	ok fair
2014-07-24 00:20:01	@relsqui	:P

2014-07-24 00:20:35	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-24 00:20:37	@relsqui	I started on white
2014-07-24 00:20:41	@relsqui	I mean, I went in the order I listed them
2014-07-24 00:20:44	@dom	rakdos is not actually very good I dont think
2014-07-24 00:20:44	@relsqui	so white and black first :)
2014-07-24 00:20:49	@dom	like the usual cards in it
2014-07-24 00:20:51	@mancat	dom: depend son format
2014-07-24 00:20:55	@dom	yeah ofc
2014-07-24 00:21:02	@mancat	shocklands in general are good for RB, because they're good for aggro
2014-07-24 00:21:08	@mancat	and RB is aggro usually
2014-07-24 00:21:18	@dom	but it seems rakdos cards most often have the shittiest sacrifices
2014-07-24 00:21:21	@mancat	also see !card blackcleave cliffs
2014-07-24 00:21:21	oracle	Land
2014-07-24 00:21:21	oracle	Blackcleave Cliffs enters the battlefield tapped unless you control two or fewer other lands.

2014-07-24 00:22:17	@relsqui	(but lightning bolt is the top of that list)
2014-07-24 00:22:47	@relsqui	haha "most unwanted cards," those most often appearing in tradelists
2014-07-24 00:22:58	@relsqui	very similar to "most collected"
2014-07-24 00:23:08	@relsqui	I would love to see the ones that are most unwanted relative to their frequency in inventories
2014-07-24 00:23:16	@relsqui	what are the cards that the least people want relative to who has them
2014-07-24 00:23:32	@relsqui	this is actually pretty interesting http://deckbox.org/statistics
2014-07-24 00:24:22	@relsqui	three shocks also on the "most often used in valid decks by active users" list :P
2014-07-24 00:26:43	@relsqui	okay, I'm done
2014-07-24 00:29:29	 *	dom watches captain america
2014-07-24 00:37:08	@relsqui	mancat: did I trade you a whip of erebos? I could have sworn I had one but my inventory says I don't
2014-07-24 00:42:39	@dom	that sounds familiar, but I wasn't paying much attention when it happened
2014-07-24 00:52:52	@relsqui	what's the general name for lands of the type of !card yavimaya coast
2014-07-24 00:52:53	oracle	Land

2014-07-24 00:53:14	@dom	pain lands
2014-07-24 00:53:17	@dom	I think
2014-07-24 00:59:37	@relsqui	sounds familiar and also logical
2014-07-24 01:04:49	@mancat	relsqui: i have one, i might have traded it from you
2014-07-24 01:05:14	@relsqui	k. either-that-or-I-just-misremembered-having-one sounds plausible enough for me
2014-07-24 01:05:40	@mancat	what dom said is accurate

2014-07-24 11:05:55	@mancat	it foces you blue, it effectivelt increases the cmc of your creature by 2, and you already have 8 alternatives

2014-07-24 11:08:02	@relsqui	presumably so that you can pull shit like this
2014-07-24 11:08:04	@mancat	yep

2014-07-24 11:11:57	@relsqui	see?
2014-07-24 11:12:07	@relsqui	dom: basically it's the "oh shit you play magic?" effect of having a deck out
2014-07-24 11:12:10	@relsqui	without having to have a deck out!
2014-07-24 11:12:28	@relsqui	it would just be fun for the double-takes
2014-07-24 11:12:36	@relsqui	"HA caught you, you play"
2014-07-24 11:12:39	@relsqui	"you laughed at my shirt"
2014-07-24 11:12:40	@mancat	except bonus only magic nerds will get it so you select or people who won't think less of you
2014-07-24 11:12:46	@relsqui	exactly! :D
2014-07-24 11:13:07	@relsqui	mancat: I was thinking about that while sitting in the Original playing with Kendall yesterday, lol
2014-07-24 11:13:10	@relsqui	it was extremely conspicuous
2014-07-24 11:13:16	@relsqui	no one said anything but a lot of people noticed
2014-07-24 11:13:41	@mancat	i feel like magic really isn't that subject to nrd persecution though
2014-07-24 11:13:46	@relsqui	nah
2014-07-24 11:13:51	@mancat	at leat not in this part of the counrty
2014-07-24 11:13:57	@relsqui	yeah, I wouldn't expect it particularly
2014-07-24 11:14:03	@relsqui	and honestly my response would be like "... really?"
2014-07-24 11:14:15	@mancat	it'scomparable to, like, being into biking, or hockey
2014-07-24 11:14:24	@relsqui	basically "I don't agree with you that this is shameful, so I'm confused by you trying to shame me about it"
2014-07-24 11:14:29	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-24 11:14:35	@relsqui	which is a strategy I have found valuable more than once

2014-07-24 14:15:07	Golem	really any of the chandras work in a burn deck, but that one gives red card advantage
2014-07-24 14:15:10	@relsqui	good! I have something to learn here
2014-07-24 14:15:11	Golem	which they dont get much of
2014-07-24 14:15:20	Golem	Thats the spirit!
2014-07-24 14:16:58	@relsqui	specifically my instinct is to not start the fire until it will end the game
2014-07-24 14:17:57	Golem	usually a good call, but you also need to use time and mana wisely.  You can only cast so many spells in a turn ^_^
2014-07-24 14:18:11	Golem	usually
2014-07-24 14:18:21	Golem	sometimes you just get omnipitance out and make people cry

2014-07-24 14:21:23	NMcCoy	I am reminded of the wisdom that any lands not tapped by the start of your next turn is mana wasted
2014-07-24 14:22:51	NMcCoy	a thing I have trouble with is leaving mana open too much; "I could play this, but I want to leave 3 mana untapped in case X happens"
2014-07-24 14:23:24	NMcCoy	I think I need to reframe that as "spending 3 mana to leave the option open, instead of spending it on something else"
2014-07-24 14:24:11	NMcCoy	if I don't have an alternative sink for the mana if the hypothetical condition isn't met, I'm just hosing my own tempo
2014-07-24 14:29:34	@relsqui	NMcCoy: I have the opposite problem
2014-07-24 14:29:37	@relsqui	which is why I'm terrible at blue
2014-07-24 14:29:38	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-24 14:30:25	@relsqui	NMcCoy: also, wanna play "what should I put in this burn deck"?
2014-07-24 14:30:31	NMcCoy	perhaps
2014-07-24 14:30:58	NMcCoy	I'm actually headed out to play Magic later tonight, so I think it'd be good to get warmed up in that mindset
2014-07-24 14:31:04	@dom	knock knock knock knock knock
2014-07-24 14:31:06	NMcCoy	haven't played for a few weeks due to being sick
2014-07-24 14:31:12	@dom	do you wanna build a burn deck
2014-07-24 14:31:45	NMcCoy	or maybe theorycraft some cards
2014-07-24 14:32:21	@relsqui	dom: yes. yes I do.
2014-07-24 14:34:40	NMcCoy	relsqui: do you have a burn deck that you want advice on?
2014-07-24 14:34:52	NMcCoy	or are you just wanting me to suggest generically good red cards?
2014-07-24 14:35:39	@relsqui	generically good burn cards in specific. I don't have that deck and I want to.

2014-07-24 14:38:14	NMcCoy	top rated burn cards
2014-07-24 14:39:27	NMcCoy	Pulse of the Forge looks pretty good
2014-07-24 14:41:22	@dom	see also pulse of the field
2014-07-24 14:41:30	@dom	in apache's edh deck
2014-07-24 14:43:04	@relsqui	not putting white in this :)
2014-07-24 14:43:26	@dom	no, I mean I think pulse of the field is better than forge
2014-07-24 14:43:29	@relsqui	hahaha I like that there's an uncard in like the top ten
2014-07-24 14:58:18	@relsqui	karmabot: lpl is an ice cream cone

2014-07-24 19:23:46	@relsqui	mancat: hey, wait a minute!! why is browbeat okay if it gives your opponent a choice?
2014-07-24 19:25:00	@relsqui	what makes it an exception to that rule :)
2014-07-24 19:25:06	@dom	target yourself and say no
2014-07-24 19:25:09	@dom	free 3 cards
2014-07-24 19:25:12	@dom	!card browbeat
2014-07-24 19:25:12	oracle	Sorcery, 2R (3)
2014-07-24 19:25:12	oracle	Any player may have Browbeat deal 5 damage to him or her. If no one does, target player draws three cards.
2014-07-24 19:25:23	@dom	oh nvm
2014-07-24 19:25:28	@dom	fk da police
2014-07-24 19:31:24	@relsqui	hrmph, I'm getting mixed success against this particular deck and not sure why
2014-07-24 19:39:26	@dom	btw you should do it cuz itd be funny
2014-07-24 19:39:49	@dom	and i think browbeat is good because its a bad decision for them
2014-07-24 19:40:03	@dom	do I get to deal 5 damage using 1 card or get 3 more ur choice buddy
2014-07-24 19:40:56	@relsqui	well but that's also true of !card indulgent tormenter
2014-07-24 19:40:56	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-24 19:40:59	@relsqui	which is in m15
2014-07-24 19:41:00	@relsqui	stupid oracle
2014-07-24 19:41:07	@relsqui	anyway and that's the on emancat was complaining about
2014-07-24 19:42:09	@dom	that dies to bolt
2014-07-24 19:42:13	@relsqui	mancat: also curious what you think of !card shrine of burning rage
2014-07-24 19:42:13	oracle	Artifact, 2 (2)
2014-07-24 19:42:13	oracle	At the beginning of your upkeep or whenever you cast a red spell, put a charge counter on Shrine of Burning Rage.
2014-07-24 19:42:13	oracle	{3}, {T}, Sacrifice Shrine of Burning Rage: Shrine of Burning Rage deals damage equal to the number of charge counters on it to target creature or player.
2014-07-24 19:42:15	@dom	and it doesn't give you three cards
2014-07-24 19:51:33	@relsqui	dom: I'm not saying that browbeat isn't straight-up a better card
2014-07-24 19:51:45	@relsqui	but what he'd actually said is never gives your opponents choices :P
2014-07-24 19:53:57	@relsqui	s/gives/give/
2014-07-24 20:11:28	Golem	I have located a standard list that plays 17 planeswalkers and uses all 5 colors.
2014-07-24 20:11:33	Golem	"imma play it"
2014-07-24 20:13:09	Golem	shrine has been giving red decks reach for a long time.  Its more traditional to put it in red aggro decks, but it works just fine in burn too
2014-07-24 20:23:30	@relsqui	hmmm
2014-07-24 20:23:39	@relsqui	I tried it for a while but I feel like it's kinda slow for burn?
2014-07-24 20:24:22	@relsqui	also I'm on the fence about ankh of mishra. it's fun, but when I'm exploding my own lands it's not always helpful
2014-07-24 20:25:30	@relsqui	also real players would probably be more careful about it than this AI :P
2014-07-24 20:25:47	 *	relsqui has won games by holding back the last burn spell for half a turn to see if the AI will shock itself
2014-07-24 20:26:39	@relsqui	tempted by fire servant but that's a lot of mana. otoh, fire servant into fireblast ...
2014-07-24 20:29:48	Golem	lol
2014-07-24 20:30:02	Golem	yeah fire servant is usually too slow for a "competative" burn deck
2014-07-24 20:30:25	Golem	shrine is usually used in metagames where there are a lot of slower decks that will just invalidate your burn with a measure of life gain
2014-07-24 20:30:48	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-24 20:30:55	Golem	Keep in mind that it accrues values even when its just sitting there
2014-07-24 20:31:04	Golem	so its easy to drop it on turn 2 and just wait
2014-07-24 20:31:14	Golem	and hey, if you cast red spells, extra damage later
2014-07-24 20:32:17	@relsqui	hmmm
2014-07-24 20:33:50	@relsqui	heh, same observation about !card quest for pure flame
2014-07-24 20:33:50	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-24 20:33:57	@relsqui	oracle: you're a jerk
2014-07-24 20:34:40	@relsqui	I'm not actually playing any creatures in this, sort of out of habit
2014-07-24 20:34:59	Golem	hmm
2014-07-24 20:35:10	@relsqui	but I keep thinking about e.g. guttersnipe
2014-07-24 20:35:17	Golem	then you might want to look at !card pyromancer's ascension
2014-07-24 20:35:18	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-24 20:35:20	Golem	beh
2014-07-24 20:35:43	@relsqui	whoa
2014-07-24 20:35:46	Golem	!card pyromancer ascension
2014-07-24 20:35:46	oracle	Enchantment, 1R (2)
2014-07-24 20:35:46	oracle	Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has the same name as a card in your graveyard, you may put a quest counter on Pyromancer Ascension.
2014-07-24 20:35:46	oracle	Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell while Pyromancer Ascension has two or more quest counters on it, you may copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
2014-07-24 20:35:47	@relsqui	yes, yes I might
2014-07-24 20:36:08	Golem	its kind of a staple for that kind of deck
2014-07-24 20:36:10	Golem	;p
2014-07-24 20:36:41	Golem	there is also !card  Pyromancer's Swath
2014-07-24 20:36:42	oracle	Enchantment, 2R (3)
2014-07-24 20:36:42	oracle	If an instant or sorcery source you control would deal damage to a creature or player, it deals that much damage plus 2 to that creature or player instead.
2014-07-24 20:36:42	oracle	At the beginning of each end step, discard your hand.
2014-07-24 20:36:49	Golem	but that takes a bit more time to build around
2014-07-24 20:37:04	@relsqui	huh, interesting
2014-07-24 20:37:52	Golem	you really want to use that one with a lot of spells with flashback
2014-07-24 20:38:00	Golem	like firebolt
2014-07-24 20:38:32	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-24 20:38:37	@relsqui	that's a neat deck but I think not the one I'm building
2014-07-24 20:39:05	Golem	indeed
2014-07-24 20:39:43	@relsqui	lol ankh of mishra'd myself to death
2014-07-24 20:39:46	@relsqui	wasn't paying attention
2014-07-24 20:39:49	Golem	>.<
2014-07-24 20:39:57	@relsqui	s'okay, was gonna lose that game anyway
2014-07-24 20:40:11	Golem	YOU dont get to kill me, I GET TO KILL ME
2014-07-24 20:40:16	Golem	HAHAHAoom
2014-07-24 20:40:20	Golem	*boom
2014-07-24 20:40:52	Golem	.....is it bad that I immediately thought "pointer to boom" when I typed that?
2014-07-24 20:41:23	@relsqui	hahaha nope
2014-07-24 20:41:24	@relsqui	no it is not
2014-07-24 20:43:50	@relsqui	heh. turn 1 lava spike, turn 2 pyromancer ascension, turn 3 lava spike, lava spike <_<
2014-07-24 20:48:23	Golem	That happens, yes
2014-07-24 20:48:38	Golem	I presume you won that one
2014-07-24 20:48:42	@relsqui	turn 4 all the things
2014-07-24 20:48:45	@relsqui	amazingly, yes, I did
2014-07-24 20:48:49	Golem	lol
2014-07-24 20:50:13	@relsqui	I picked a good deck to test against; we're pretty evenly matched so I really notice if something's making my life harder or easier
2014-07-24 20:53:46	Golem	an evenly matched enemy can be more valueable than a dear friend : some kung fu movie
2014-07-24 20:54:28	@relsqui	lol

2014-07-24 20:57:02	@relsqui	this still isn't right and not sure how to improve it
2014-07-24 20:57:49	@relsqui	also I don't often get to keep pyromancer ascension on the board because I'm playing vs. mono white aggro
2014-07-24 20:57:50	@dom	what feels bad
2014-07-24 20:58:06	@relsqui	dom: keep getting facebeat by well-equipped creatures
2014-07-24 21:02:25	@relsqui	I think I need a different perspective
2014-07-24 21:02:28	 *	relsqui searches up more opponents
2014-07-24 21:04:51	Golem	oh jeeze
2014-07-24 21:05:00	Golem	if you are gonna be playing like that you need a sideboard
2014-07-24 21:05:08	Golem	with stuff like Anger of the Gods in it
2014-07-24 21:08:27	@relsqui	well I'm playing !card slag storm

2014-07-24 21:44:42	@relsqui	should try swapping quest out for ascension again now that I'm not playing against oring
2014-07-24 21:52:49	@relsqui	hm. doing that also forced me to tighten up the miscellany of burn spells <_< to make it more useful
2014-07-24 22:21:22	@relsqui	huh. and then it turns out I don't want eithe rone

2014-07-25 02:29:51	oracle	Storm (When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.)
2014-07-25 02:31:21	@relsqui	I'm starting to get the hang of this
2014-07-25 03:43:21	@relsqui	mountain -> rite of flames -> pyretic ritual -> desperate ritual -> seething song -> faithless looting -> desperate ritual -> empty the warrens
2014-07-25 03:43:30	@relsqui	14 tokens on turn 1
2014-07-25 03:44:02	@relsqui	this is so, so silly
2014-07-25 09:10:21	@mancat	:D relsqui built storm!
2014-07-25 12:00:54	@relsqui	^_^
2014-07-25 12:01:12	@relsqui	mancat: I did! I refined it a bit from there
2014-07-25 12:01:20	@relsqui	it's not super reliable because it's hard to get all the pieces I need
2014-07-25 12:01:32	@relsqui	but it has like, all the rituals and draw I could find
2014-07-25 12:01:38	@relsqui	average cmc in the deck is like 1.75 :P
2014-07-25 12:01:44	@relsqui	and when it goes off it really goes off
2014-07-25 12:03:52	@relsqui	it beats tempered steel pretty reliably :) more than any of my other decks
2014-07-25 12:04:07	@relsqui	as well as every other decklist of ours that I have set up in forge, except soul sisters
2014-07-25 12:04:22	@relsqui	it *could* beat soul sisters but you'd have to get lucky
2014-07-25 12:04:39	@relsqui	(since it plays on 1-2 mana)
2014-07-25 12:06:27	@relsqui	would probably be more reliable if I were more aggressive about mulls, heh
2014-07-25 12:07:47	@dom	does it beat legacy goblins
2014-07-25 12:09:27	@relsqui	dunno. we should find out ;)
2014-07-25 12:09:31	@relsqui	it *is* legacy goblins, technically :P
2014-07-25 12:11:17	@dom	well what do you use to actually kill people?
2014-07-25 12:11:21	@relsqui	I think it could, I'd have to get lucky on draws
2014-07-25 12:11:28	@dom	yeah maybe
2014-07-25 12:11:32	@relsqui	~14 3/1 tokens with haste on turn, like, two
2014-07-25 12:11:35	@relsqui	is what I actually use to kill people
2014-07-25 12:11:35	@dom	also neither of us runs sideboard yet
2014-07-25 12:11:52	@relsqui	the best I've done is 20
2014-07-25 12:11:54	@relsqui	(tokens)
2014-07-25 12:11:58	@dom	heh nice
2014-07-25 12:12:42	@dom	is there a 1 cmc for !card scouring sands
2014-07-25 12:12:43	oracle	Sorcery, 1R (2)
2014-07-25 12:12:43	oracle	Scouring Sands deals 1 damage to each creature your opponents control. Scry 1. (Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)
2014-07-25 12:13:39	@relsqui	you don't need that at 1cmc, you need that at instant speed
2014-07-25 12:14:12	@dom	no, if its 1 cmc, even if I draw first, I still kill all the tokens
2014-07-25 12:14:37	@relsqui	on your turn, you do.
2014-07-25 12:14:51	@relsqui	my opponent doesn't generally get another turn after this goes off
2014-07-25 12:14:56	@dom	yeah, you haven't mentioned the piece yet that gives them all +2/+0 and haste
2014-07-25 12:14:58	@relsqui	anyway you want !card seismic shift
2014-07-25 12:14:59	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-25 12:15:03	@relsqui	er
2014-07-25 12:15:06	@relsqui	!card seismic shudder
2014-07-25 12:15:06	@dom	so im operating under the assumption that theyre all 1/1

2014-07-25 12:15:06	oracle	Seismic Shudder deals 1 damage to each creature without flying.
2014-07-25 12:15:14	@relsqui	dom: yeah, nope
2014-07-25 12:15:21	@relsqui	I said on turn 2 and I meant it. hang on
2014-07-25 12:15:22	@dom	so mention all the pieces

2014-07-25 12:16:04	oracle	Add {R}{R} to your mana pool, then add {R} to your mana pool for each card named Rite of Flame in each graveyard.
2014-07-25 12:16:20	@dom	I know those ones
2014-07-25 12:16:24	@dom	I saw the chain
2014-07-25 12:16:33	@dom	but where is the haste and +2/+0 spell?
2014-07-25 12:16:39	@relsqui	...
2014-07-25 12:16:39	@dom	you mentioned 3/1s with haste
2014-07-25 12:16:45	@relsqui	oh, I pulled the wrong one
2014-07-25 12:16:51	@relsqui	!card burst of speed
2014-07-25 12:16:51	oracle	Sorcery, R (1)
2014-07-25 12:16:51	oracle	Creatures you control gain haste until end of turn. (They can attack and {T} even if they just came under your control.)
2014-07-25 12:16:53	@relsqui	is what I meant by the last one
2014-07-25 12:17:02	@relsqui	quest for the goblin lord is the +2/+0
2014-07-25 12:17:11	@relsqui	it's a one-drop quest, gets a counter when a goblin etb
2014-07-25 12:17:17	@relsqui	5+ counters -> all goblins have +2/+0
2014-07-25 12:17:43	@relsqui	so it's draw draw draw ritual ritual ritual, quest, empty, burst
2014-07-25 12:17:46	@relsqui	swing
2014-07-25 12:17:57	@dom	yes, thats the full combo
2014-07-25 12:18:09	@relsqui	I know
2014-07-25 12:18:14	@relsqui	that's why I said it when you asked me for it
2014-07-25 12:18:17	@relsqui	<_<
2014-07-25 12:18:22	@dom	but you didn't the first time >>
2014-07-25 12:18:32	@relsqui	I just misread, I'm half asleep
2014-07-25 12:18:40	@relsqui	(misread the list I mean)
2014-07-25 12:18:43	@dom	good, let your sleep flow through you
2014-07-25 12:18:46	@relsqui	I keep mixing up the ____ of ____s at a glance
2014-07-25 12:23:48	@relsqui	anyway yeah
2014-07-25 12:23:58	@relsqui	if I can get the whole thing to go off you'd need instant speed to cut it down
2014-07-25 12:24:07	@relsqui	but I can't always get every piece to line up
2014-07-25 12:25:30	@dom	well, I mean "If I get these 7 cards in hand, and the other guy has no board and is tapped out"...
2014-07-25 12:25:41	@dom	or "Is AI"...
2014-07-25 12:25:41	@relsqui	you don't have to have no board and be tapped out
2014-07-25 12:25:58	@dom	completing the comparison
2014-07-25 12:26:07	 *	relsqui shrugs
2014-07-25 12:26:12	@relsqui	I mean, feel free to assume it's bad without seeing it I guess
2014-07-25 12:26:26	@dom	what?
2014-07-25 12:26:30	@dom	im not assuming that at all
2014-07-25 12:26:35	@relsqui	maybe I misparsed that
2014-07-25 12:26:43	@dom	combo decks with lots of moving parts just feel clunky
2014-07-25 12:26:47	@dom	that doesn't mean its not good
2014-07-25 12:27:22	@relsqui	it's not the smoothest but it works more than you'd think; it draws a *lot*
2014-07-25 12:27:27	@dom	sure
2014-07-25 12:27:31	@relsqui	so it's not that common that I just can't find what I need
2014-07-25 12:27:54	@relsqui	also, for anything that doesn't have fairly specific hate for it, I can take a couple of turns if I need to
2014-07-25 12:28:26	@relsqui	s/for anything/against anything/
2014-07-25 12:28:35	@relsqui	like, my red deck can hit it pretty hard
2014-07-25 12:28:53	@relsqui	er
2014-07-25 12:28:55	@relsqui	my other red deck
2014-07-25 12:28:57	@relsqui	wait I can't even say that
2014-07-25 12:29:00	@relsqui	my red control deck, dammit
2014-07-25 12:29:02	@dom	I understand
2014-07-25 12:29:07	@relsqui	now I have a red control deck, a red burn deck, and a red combo deck
2014-07-25 12:29:08	@relsqui	...
2014-07-25 12:29:11	@relsqui	I should build a red aggro deck
2014-07-25 12:29:12	@relsqui	rofl
2014-07-25 12:29:16	@relsqui	just on principle
2014-07-25 12:29:18	@dom	let the mountains flow through you
2014-07-25 12:29:23	@relsqui	yes.
2014-07-25 12:29:31	@relsqui	as much as I <3 golgari, it's good to be back ;)
2014-07-25 12:33:01	@dom	I feel like I'm overdue for a selesnya control deck
2014-07-25 12:33:03	@dom	like a good one
2014-07-25 12:33:11	@dom	not "my control cards and brimaz"

2014-07-26 15:41:19	@mancat	i think they might have been scared at what happened during Scars of Mirrodin block
2014-07-26 15:41:23	@relsqui	mm?
2014-07-26 15:41:31	@mancat	it's happened before
2014-07-26 15:41:38	@mancat	(usually after artifact-themed sets, lol)
2014-07-26 15:42:01	@relsqui	heh
2014-07-26 15:42:08	@mancat	original Mirrodin block and Urza's block were peaks in the power curve of magic sets over time, things got weaker in the sets following those
2014-07-26 15:42:31	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-26 15:42:47	@relsqui	when you put it that way -- they can't all be peaks :P so by definition some are gonna be lower
2014-07-26 15:42:53	@mancat	i feel like 2009-2011 was like a high point in magic power
2014-07-26 15:43:01	@relsqui	^ can I just take that sentence out of context
2014-07-26 15:43:02	@relsqui	with no caps
2014-07-26 15:43:03	@mancat	yeah but i think it was intentional in those cases
2014-07-26 15:43:11	@mancat	players started leaving the format, things were too degenerate
2014-07-26 15:43:15	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-26 15:43:31	@mancat	standard formats with Academy decks and Ravager Affinity are not fun formats
2014-07-26 15:43:48	@relsqui	heh, yeah
2014-07-26 15:43:56	@relsqui	have you ever played the duel decks? I'm curious about the new one
2014-07-26 15:44:07	@mancat	likewise with Cawblade from Zendikar/Scars era
2014-07-26 15:44:16	@mancat	most of them are good and worth buying
2014-07-26 15:44:21	@mancat	some have sucked, mostly the old ones
2014-07-26 15:44:33	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-26 15:44:45	@relsqui	ugh we should buy stuff for club.
2014-07-26 15:44:49	@mancat	we really should
2014-07-26 15:44:56	@relsqui	we really need to nail down what that's gonna be
2014-07-26 15:45:05	@mancat	omg we should see if we can get a reserve at some flgs for From The Vaults
2014-07-26 15:45:09	@mancat	the new one sounds bad-ass
2014-07-26 15:45:19	@mancat	i'm pretty sure it will be full of playables
2014-07-26 15:45:36	 *	relsqui nods!
2014-07-26 15:45:40	@mancat	last year's FTV was terrible :(
2014-07-26 15:45:47	@relsqui	what was it?
2014-07-26 15:45:51	 *	relsqui could look it up, lay
2014-07-26 15:45:52	@relsqui	lazy
2014-07-26 15:46:00	@mancat	FTV: Twenty, commonly called FTV: Jace
2014-07-26 15:46:03	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-26 15:46:05	@relsqui	I see.
2014-07-26 15:46:20	@mancat	it had 20 cards that each were influential in a different year of magic tournament play
2014-07-26 15:46:31	@mancat	basically it was Jace and a bunch of 1-dollar value uncommons
2014-07-26 15:46:49	@mancat	(by Jace i mean Jace TMS, but you probably got that)
2014-07-26 15:46:57	@mancat	Jace, The Hundred-Dollar Bill
2014-07-26 15:47:14	@mancat	Jace, Ass-Fucker Of Formats
2014-07-26 15:47:22	@mancat	Jace, Who Is Broken In Every Game
2014-07-26 15:47:28	@mancat	>:(
2014-07-26 15:47:42	 *	mancat still mad, 4 years later
2014-07-26 15:48:09	@mancat	anyway

2014-07-26 15:49:43	@relsqui	like, I realize this is unprecedented, but I'm actually not down there, lol
2014-07-26 15:50:22	@mancat	:DDDD

2014-07-26 15:51:23	@relsqui	(but go ahead and ping if you do wind up down there, I might if I'm having trouble getting work done up here)
2014-07-26 16:31:07	@dom	mancat: I'll be there if you show up
2014-07-26 16:31:19	@dom	I just have no reason to leave dorm atm heh
2014-07-26 16:35:02	@relsqui	ohhhhh weird
2014-07-26 16:35:04	@relsqui	Khans of Tarkir comes out. You draft Khans/Khans/Khans.
2014-07-26 16:35:04	@relsqui	"Dewey" comes out. You draft "Dewey"/Khans/Khans.
2014-07-26 16:35:04	@relsqui	"Louie" comes out. You draft "Louie"/"Louie"/"Dewey".
2014-07-26 16:35:05	@relsqui	"Dewey" is drafted with each large set separately.
2014-07-26 16:35:13	@relsqui	^ that's the answer, about drafting
2014-07-26 16:35:19	@relsqui	so I guess you never draft the two big sets together?
2014-07-26 16:35:26	@relsqui	I'm guessing this has to do with the time travel theme
2014-07-26 16:35:36	@relsqui	like the first and last set are two alternate realities
2014-07-26 16:35:40	@relsqui	this is going to be trpipy
2014-07-26 16:37:59	@relsqui	I'm not really delighted to see morph, but I'm guessing there's a reason for it ... hmm
2014-07-26 16:38:03	@relsqui	we shall see
2014-07-26 18:59:53	@dom	well *im* going to be on campus in like 30 if anyone wants to trip and fall onto a bus
2014-07-26 19:27:13	Golem	First khans spoilers is up.  First guy huge, indestructable attacker....that dies to shock and doesnt have trample.  BAH.

2014-07-26 19:46:48	@dom	hey, they're bringing back orcs I guess
2014-07-26 19:54:04	Golem	Im ok with that
2014-07-26 19:54:10	Golem	looks like they are doing proper orcs
2014-07-26 19:55:52	@relsqui	Golem: lol, see scrollback
2014-07-26 19:56:11	@relsqui	15:38:39 <@mancat> dies to shock
2014-07-26 19:56:11	@relsqui	15:38:42 <@relsqui> SEVEN POWER, INDESTRUCTIBLE, GAINS COUNTERS, dies to shock
2014-07-26 19:57:25	@relsqui	in summary, dies to shock
2014-07-26 19:58:49	Golem	yar
2014-07-26 19:59:01	Golem	i mean, its nice that it doesnt die to shock on the turn you play him
2014-07-26 19:59:06	Golem	but it doesnt have trample
2014-07-26 19:59:15	Golem	I ATTACK WITH MY MASSIVE ORC LEGEND LOL
2014-07-26 19:59:15	Golem	ok
2014-07-26 19:59:22	Golem	I block with my 1/1 soldier token
2014-07-26 19:59:26	Golem	I shock it
2014-07-26 19:59:38	@relsqui	I shock it on your turn, because instants lol
2014-07-26 19:59:39	Golem	and then your inner timmy cries a little
2014-07-26 19:59:42	@relsqui	er wait
2014-07-26 19:59:42	Golem	yeah
2014-07-26 19:59:46	@relsqui	on my turn
2014-07-26 19:59:53	Golem	And thats the other thing
2014-07-26 19:59:57	@relsqui	I ... some sorcery that deals two damage it
2014-07-26 19:59:59	@relsqui	I don't even know, heh
2014-07-26 20:00:05	@dom	pillar of flame

2014-07-26 20:00:08	@dom	and its exiled
2014-07-26 20:00:09	@dom	:)
2014-07-26 20:00:15	Golem	what good is a 5 mana creature that dies to both wrath of god AND sorcery shock?
2014-07-26 20:00:19	@relsqui	yes, thank you
2014-07-26 20:00:21	Golem	BAH
2014-07-26 20:00:29	Golem	grumblegrumblegrumble
2014-07-26 20:00:40	@dom	I mean its in black too so you can reanimate shenanigans
2014-07-26 20:00:42	Golem	I suppose it is white so you can get one way wraths if you like
2014-07-26 20:00:43	@dom	white too for that matter
2014-07-26 20:00:52	Golem	Thats something at least
2014-07-26 20:00:58	@dom	but yeah its far from great
2014-07-26 20:01:05	@dom	I'd rather have a 5/4 with same stuff
2014-07-26 20:01:16	Golem	yar
2014-07-26 20:01:16	@dom	but im thinking thats the point, to be sure
2014-07-26 20:01:22	Golem	I like this guy though
2014-07-26 20:01:26	Golem	https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/493118378546962433/photo/1
2014-07-26 20:01:41	Golem	I wake up in the morning, have a cup of joe, and then PUNCH A BEAR IN THE FACE
2014-07-26 20:01:46	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-26 20:02:04	@relsqui	it's really easy to imagine the audience flipping out over that, yes
2014-07-26 20:02:29	@dom	as an aside, thats what I imagine kafka to look like
2014-07-26 20:02:29	@relsqui	https://twitter.com/thepaulhagan/status/493121196309766144 yesss
2014-07-26 20:02:30	@relsqui	lol

2014-07-26 20:02:42	@relsqui	dom: oh, good to know
2014-07-26 20:02:49	@relsqui	except iirc he cut his hair off
2014-07-26 20:02:59	@relsqui	"I presume this is another philosopher from Theros"
2014-07-26 20:03:01	@dom	yeah he has short hair
2014-07-26 20:03:10	@dom	but thats pretty close
2014-07-26 20:03:12	@dom	no runes, etc
2014-07-26 20:03:23	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-26 20:03:24	@dom	I mean not having runes is the other difference
2014-07-26 20:03:35	@relsqui	yeah, got that
2014-07-26 20:03:49	@relsqui	I'm into the costume design there
2014-07-26 20:04:31	@relsqui	also the bear's tongue
2014-07-26 20:04:33	@relsqui	kinda makes it
2014-07-26 20:05:34	Golem	I think im gonna like the temur

2014-07-26 20:06:25	@dom	that taps for 3 card draw
2014-07-26 20:06:25	@dom	amg
2014-07-26 20:06:37	@relsqui	teferi!
2014-07-26 20:06:40	@relsqui	teferi gets a walker!
2014-07-26 20:06:47	@relsqui	he had to wait until after he lost his spark to get a walker card
2014-07-26 20:06:49	@relsqui	but here we are
2014-07-26 20:07:47	@relsqui	I wanna run that card with hate bears
2014-07-26 20:07:52	@relsqui	I don't even know what card it is
2014-07-26 20:07:56	@relsqui	just on principle
2014-07-26 20:07:58	Golem	So he is getting his walker spark back?
2014-07-26 20:08:09	Golem	i mean, im ok with this
2014-07-26 20:08:13	Golem	but its a little odd
2014-07-26 20:08:33	@relsqui	no, he's not
2014-07-26 20:08:38	@relsqui	the card depicts him before he lost it
2014-07-26 20:08:49	Golem	?_?
2014-07-26 20:09:04	@relsqui	it's not a current image/status of teferi
2014-07-26 20:09:10	@relsqui	en moment
2014-07-26 20:09:29	Golem	its in khans though?
2014-07-26 20:09:31	@dom	he is a time mage
2014-07-26 20:09:33	@dom	right
2014-07-26 20:09:42	Golem	ahh
2014-07-26 20:10:46	@relsqui	no, it's in commander
2014-07-26 20:11:30	@relsqui	the hell, where is it
2014-07-26 20:11:34	@relsqui	someone asked about this on blogatog and I can't find it
2014-07-26 20:11:35	@relsqui	sorry
2014-07-26 20:11:42	Golem	np
2014-07-26 20:11:50	@relsqui	oh, maybe that was voice of vorthos
2014-07-26 20:11:59	@relsqui	ah yup
2014-07-26 20:12:04	@relsqui	http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/post/92953668744/with-teferi-coming-back-will-there-be-any-explanation
2014-07-26 20:12:19	@relsqui	" the Teferi planeswalker card in the next Commander product represents Teferi from before he gave up his spark to seal the time rift. Currently Teferi continues to be without his spark, but we thought players would enjoy seeing a card of that earlier planeswalker state, despite the tricky chronology."
2014-07-26 20:12:55	@relsqui	> My hobbies include forging worlds from the ensorcelled depths of my mind-aether. I also enjoy pestering R&D developers. Also eating pancakes.
2014-07-26 20:12:59	@relsqui	Doug sounds like a stand-up guy
2014-07-26 20:13:00	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-26 20:13:06	@relsqui	all of those are good hobbies

2014-07-26 20:27:04	aliaras	hi I'm relsqui's friend
2014-07-26 20:27:09	aliaras	they told me to say hi
2014-07-26 20:33:01	@dom	hi relsqui's friend
2014-07-26 20:33:21	@dom	(they didn't tell me to say hi)
2014-07-26 20:33:27	@dom	(I did it of my own accord)
2014-07-26 20:33:35	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 20:33:35	aliaras	hi!
2014-07-26 20:33:39	@dom	hi!
2014-07-26 20:33:49	aliaras	also I just thought of aquestion: when one is playing magic irl, what does one do about tokens, usually?
2014-07-26 20:33:56	@dom	dice!
2014-07-26 20:34:02	@dom	or pieces of paper
2014-07-26 20:34:04	@dom	or token cards
2014-07-26 20:34:05	aliaras	hmmkay!
2014-07-26 20:34:09	@dom	dice is most common
2014-07-26 20:34:39	@dom	theoretically they should be token cards, but most people have tons of dice and no token cards
2014-07-26 20:34:48	@dom	so no one balks :P
2014-07-26 20:34:56	@dom	relsqui collects token cards though, last I heard
2014-07-26 20:35:41	Golem	Hi relsqui's friend!
2014-07-26 20:36:10	@dom	this channel is beginning to sound like AA

2014-07-26 20:36:37	Golem	the first thing to understand is, you dont have a problem.  you have a hobby
2014-07-26 20:36:48	aliaras	I went out and bought cards, a piercing, and art supplies, where the art supplies were partly so I could proxy more different cards
2014-07-26 20:36:52	aliaras	it has been an impulse buy day :P
2014-07-26 20:36:57	aliaras	and I begin to understand this "problem"
2014-07-26 20:37:00	@dom	hehe
2014-07-26 20:37:06	@dom	proxy cards make it way more bearble
2014-07-26 20:37:08	@dom	bearable
2014-07-26 20:37:08	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-26 20:37:11	Golem	Welcome to the collective
2014-07-26 20:37:13	Golem	one of us
2014-07-26 20:37:15	Golem	one of us
2014-07-26 20:37:17	aliaras	although my god, cutting out 50+ cards
2014-07-26 20:37:19	aliaras	on paper
2014-07-26 20:37:21	@dom	yah
2014-07-26 20:37:24	Golem	yup
2014-07-26 20:37:26	@dom	it helps if you have a paper cutter
2014-07-26 20:37:42	aliaras	I emailed coworker who's taught me to play some (as has relsqui) to be all "card sleeves are in let's go next week"
2014-07-26 20:37:42	@dom	but most people don't :P
2014-07-26 20:37:47	aliaras	and he was like, maybe I won't have time
2014-07-26 20:37:53	aliaras	and I was a little surprised to find him on mtgo then
2014-07-26 20:37:59	@dom	hah
2014-07-26 20:38:04	aliaras	but it became clear when I was still exactoing paper two hours later
2014-07-26 20:38:32	@dom	hehe
2014-07-26 20:38:50	@dom	I did a deck in 20 minutes, but I also cut all the paper at once with scissors
2014-07-26 20:38:54	@dom	most of the card is there
2014-07-26 20:39:02	@dom	more than 90% of each card!
2014-07-26 20:39:03	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 20:39:06	@dom	who needs borders?
2014-07-26 20:39:09	aliaras	man just sleeving it took 20 minutes
2014-07-26 20:39:34	@dom	did you have something to put behind the sleeves at least?
2014-07-26 20:39:45	@dom	err, behind the proxies
2014-07-26 20:40:33	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-26 20:40:38	aliaras	that was part of why I bought the cards :P
2014-07-26 20:40:55	@dom	kek
2014-07-26 20:42:28	aliaras	commons somehow magically becoming rare~
2014-07-26 20:42:42	@dom	thus is the life of a proxy
2014-07-26 20:43:02	aliaras	I do want more actual white cards that have low CMC and spawn tokens though
2014-07-26 20:43:19	aliaras	I got a starter white/green m15 deck that is like "spawn tokens, convoke, profit"
2014-07-26 20:43:26	@dom	yah
2014-07-26 20:43:49	@dom	white weenies (what that deck sounds like) has long been a popular deck
2014-07-26 20:44:02	aliaras	yeah, it's white weenies + then you get white/green not-so-weenies
2014-07-26 20:44:08	@dom	yeah sure
2014-07-26 20:44:29	aliaras	except two playtests against relsqui's burn deck say it needs more low-mana stuff
2014-07-26 20:44:34	aliaras	because I didn't get it going and got toasted
2014-07-26 20:44:40	@dom	burn deck or control deck?
2014-07-26 20:44:46	aliaras	(also hp, stuff that doesn't interact with creatures in sideboard)
2014-07-26 20:44:47	aliaras	burn deck
2014-07-26 20:44:52	@dom	gotcha
2014-07-26 20:44:53	aliaras	Haven't tried control deck yet
2014-07-26 20:45:05	@dom	itll probably lose to control deck :P
2014-07-26 20:45:18	@dom	the control deck is brutal to any deck that isn't that speedy
2014-07-26 20:45:39	aliaras	it should be reasonably speedy, though
2014-07-26 20:45:42	aliaras	I say should
2014-07-26 20:45:54	aliaras	this is why I want more cards, to shift mana curve down
2014-07-26 20:45:57	@dom	sure
2014-07-26 20:46:10	@dom	well, replace the higher costs, yeah?

2014-07-26 20:46:30	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-26 20:46:30	@dom	^ thats often a good choice for white weenie
2014-07-26 20:46:35	aliaras	that looks good
2014-07-26 20:46:44	@dom	also have you seen !card dryad militant

2014-07-26 20:46:49	@dom	a personal favorite
2014-07-26 20:47:21	@dom	(also it stops flashback from burn decks. very nice :) )

2014-07-26 20:49:47	aliaras	:(
2014-07-26 20:49:51	aliaras	or m15 apparently
2014-07-26 20:49:54	@dom	probably doesn't have m15
2014-07-26 20:49:55	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-26 20:50:01	aliaras	I was just gonna say it's a neat card
2014-07-26 20:50:11	@dom	yeah it pulls from magiccards.info so it doesn't know a lot of newer stuff
2014-07-26 20:54:28	aliaras	y'know, maybe I'll slot the soulmenders I have in there
2014-07-26 20:55:41	aliaras	or more elves.
2014-07-26 20:56:14	@dom	elves is a deck all in itself :P
2014-07-26 20:56:35	@dom	I've never played it, so I don't know the speed of it, but it is in green so its probably pretty fast
2014-07-26 20:56:45	aliaras	cmc of 1, tap for one mana
2014-07-26 20:56:54	aliaras	so yes, when my problem is "accelerate faster", it helps :P
2014-07-26 20:57:02	@dom	well yes, but thats not every elf
2014-07-26 20:57:11	@dom	there is more than mystic or llanowar elves :P
2014-07-26 21:00:02	aliaras	haha, fair
2014-07-26 21:08:12	@relsqui	yay hi
2014-07-26 21:09:08	aliaras	hi!
2014-07-26 21:09:15	aliaras	I think I might have fixed my deck-- wanna go again?
2014-07-26 21:09:25	aliaras	with either burn or the other one you wanted to try (I did find the transcription error)
2014-07-26 21:09:34	aliaras	(I do not have 14 forests, I have 13)
2014-07-26 21:09:36	@relsqui	http://magiccards.info/ths/en/9.html

2014-07-26 21:14:21	@relsqui	aliaras: okay we're hanging out and laptopping so I would game a game
2014-07-26 21:14:29	@relsqui	aliaras: did you wanna try vs burn again or something a little more similar?
2014-07-26 21:14:37	aliaras	hrm.
2014-07-26 21:14:42	aliaras	a little more similar I think
2014-07-26 21:14:44	@relsqui	k
2014-07-26 21:14:45	aliaras	then burn if we have more time
2014-07-26 21:14:52	aliaras	mostly I need to see how the mana curve plays now
2014-07-26 21:14:54	@relsqui	could wolves
2014-07-26 21:14:55	@relsqui	tokenfight go

2014-07-26 21:23:52	@relsqui	or I can't figure out how
2014-07-26 21:34:06	@relsqui	gah
2014-07-26 21:34:12	@relsqui	when the convoke deck taps three lands and four creatures
2014-07-26 21:34:14	@relsqui	shit is going down
2014-07-26 21:34:42	@relsqui	... and indeed
2014-07-26 21:34:45	@mancat	hi relsqui's friend :P
2014-07-26 21:36:12	@relsqui	^_^
2014-07-26 21:37:08	@relsqui	mancat, aliaras. aliaras, mancat
2014-07-26 21:37:11	@relsqui	I have spoken of both of you to each other
2014-07-26 21:38:58	@relsqui	and you're both p. rad
2014-07-26 21:40:44	@relsqui	lolol aliaras is playing good cards, by Relsqui's Rules of Good Magic Cards
2014-07-26 21:40:50	aliaras	which is?
2014-07-26 21:40:58	@mancat	makes your opponent say "shit..."
2014-07-26 21:41:00	aliaras	hahahahaha
2014-07-26 21:41:03	@mancat	:P
2014-07-26 21:41:09	@mancat	it's a good rule, i think
2014-07-26 21:41:29	aliaras	I successfully pulled "Triplicate Spirits" and so I have three spirits out, which means I can start spawning Seraph of the Masses...
2014-07-26 21:41:44	aliaras	which is currently at 8/8
2014-07-26 21:41:53	@relsqui	there's two rules
2014-07-26 21:41:56	@mancat	I heard a rumor you like spirits :P
2014-07-26 21:42:03	@relsqui	a card is good if it makes a) you laugh or b) your opponent swear
2014-07-26 21:42:03	@mancat	or more accurately, tokens
2014-07-26 21:42:05	aliaras	when they're basically "tap for mana" yes :P
2014-07-26 21:42:25	@mancat	are you playing standard, or just cards?
2014-07-26 21:42:30	aliaras	standard
2014-07-26 21:42:34	aliaras	well, standard decks
2014-07-26 21:42:36	@relsqui	I think she might just be playing m15, actually?
2014-07-26 21:42:40	aliaras	yeah I am
2014-07-26 21:42:43	@mancat	:( no Gavony Township for you
2014-07-26 21:42:46	@relsqui	my wolf deck is ..... modern iirc?
2014-07-26 21:42:49	 *	mancat misses Gavony Township
2014-07-26 21:42:55	aliaras	mancat: I got a m15 starter deck thingy
2014-07-26 21:43:02	@mancat	nice :)
2014-07-26 21:43:02	aliaras	mancat: and a shitton of m15 packs
2014-07-26 21:43:07	@mancat	:DDD
2014-07-26 21:43:09	aliaras	so I subbed a few cards but mostly it's m15 up in this
2014-07-26 21:43:16	@relsqui	mancat: SO ARE WE GETTING AN M15 BOX?
2014-07-26 21:43:17	@relsqui	:P
2014-07-26 21:43:21	@relsqui	or are you still sore at it >_>
2014-07-26 21:43:25	aliaras	?
2014-07-26 21:43:26	@mancat	relsqui: lol no we hsould get one
2014-07-26 21:43:33	@mancat	...or we could get a better set in place of one >_>
2014-07-26 21:43:45	@relsqui	uhhuh <_<
2014-07-26 21:43:48	@mancat	i'm pretty sure Dark Scension is still fairly cheap
2014-07-26 21:43:50	@relsqui	aliaras: mancat didn't have as much fun at prerelease as I did
2014-07-26 21:43:54	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 21:44:03	@mancat	lol yeah i remembered why i swore not to play sealed deck any more
2014-07-26 21:44:13	@mancat	i have the most awful luck at sealed deck events
2014-07-26 21:44:17	@relsqui	mancat: we should try team sealed
2014-07-26 21:44:20	@relsqui	see if we can break the curse
2014-07-26 21:44:23	@mancat	that's not a good idea
2014-07-26 21:44:25	@mancat	for you
2014-07-26 21:44:30	@mancat	you will open shitty cards :P
2014-07-26 21:44:34	@relsqui	nuh uh
2014-07-26 21:44:40	@relsqui	I have good pack luck
2014-07-26 21:44:42	@relsqui	we'll balance out
2014-07-26 21:44:44	@relsqui	you can have some of mine :)
2014-07-26 21:44:52	@mancat	haha ok
2014-07-26 21:44:55	@mancat	we'll try it
2014-07-26 21:45:15	@mancat	oh man
2014-07-26 21:45:22	@mancat	can we talk about how it's no-pants o'clock
2014-07-26 21:45:22	aliaras	I should look at other sets that are out
2014-07-26 21:45:27	aliaras	and see what would work with this deck
2014-07-26 21:45:29	@relsqui	yes we can and yes it is
2014-07-26 21:45:32	@mancat	and how i have a critical lack of alcohol :(
2014-07-26 21:45:33	aliaras	and get a pack or something
2014-07-26 21:45:39	aliaras	I am still wearing pants :(
2014-07-26 21:45:41	aliaras	maybe I should stop
2014-07-26 21:45:42	aliaras	brb
2014-07-26 21:45:45	@mancat	poor strategy
2014-07-26 21:45:48	@mancat	:D yay!
2014-07-26 21:45:52	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-26 21:45:56	@mancat	dom: no-pants o'clock
2014-07-26 21:46:04	@mancat	golem: ^
2014-07-26 21:46:06	@relsqui	I'm wearing something on my legs but it's the shortest skirt I own
2014-07-26 21:46:17	@relsqui	and more or less the shortest legs garment I'd wear in public
2014-07-26 21:46:19	@relsqui	so I think that counts
2014-07-26 21:46:20	@mancat	i think that's allowed
2014-07-26 21:46:26	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-26 21:46:29	@relsqui	I mean also I'm on ubiquill's couch

2014-07-26 21:47:03	@mancat	i really need a beer though :\
2014-07-26 21:47:50	 *	mancat wonders if it's ethically justifiable to put on shorts long enough to go to Fire on the Mountain and get beer
2014-07-26 21:48:10	 *	mancat pokes at the things he acquired today
2014-07-26 21:49:16	aliaras	oww <3

2014-07-26 21:50:12	@relsqui	R
2014-07-26 21:50:14	@mancat	:D i always have that problem in cockatrice
2014-07-26 21:50:15	@relsqui	target player gains 3 life
2014-07-26 21:50:23	aliaras	also it is now nopants o'clock and furthermore ibuprofen o'clock
2014-07-26 21:50:27	@relsqui	mancat: you can come watch if you want :) if aliaras set spectators
2014-07-26 21:50:38	@mancat	i think i eventually just memorized the "set life" shotcut and just set absolute values instead of trying to remember if it was right or left click
2014-07-26 21:50:43	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-26 21:50:48	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 21:50:53	aliaras	right click on mac is hard
2014-07-26 21:50:57	aliaras	also drawing the cards you want is hard.
2014-07-26 21:50:58	@mancat	trufax
2014-07-26 21:51:01	@relsqui	oh man TIL cockatrice has a "make me another of the same token as last time" button
2014-07-26 21:51:07	@mancat	oh man
2014-07-26 21:51:15	aliaras	I'm going to lose because slow again
2014-07-26 21:51:18	aliaras	eff it's that thing
2014-07-26 21:51:19	@relsqui	mancat: you know what I'm not sick of yet it's ankh of mishra
2014-07-26 21:51:26	@mancat	cockatrice has many shortcuts that you ignore as confusing and unnecessary when you first use it, and eventually you're like "...damn that's useful"
2014-07-26 21:51:28	aliaras	it is indeed a Good Card
2014-07-26 21:51:30	@relsqui	mancat: yeah
2014-07-26 21:51:33	aliaras	by the relsqui metric
2014-07-26 21:51:36	@relsqui	^_^
2014-07-26 21:51:37	aliaras	every time I see it "oh fuck"
2014-07-26 21:51:39	@mancat	relsqui: :DDDDDDD ankh of misra is the best thing
2014-07-26 21:51:50	@relsqui	mancat: also WHY THE FUCK CAN COCKATRICE NOT DFC
2014-07-26 21:51:53	@relsqui	sad wolf deck is sad
2014-07-26 21:51:57	@mancat	>_> yeah
2014-07-26 21:52:09	@mancat	i think it just doesn't cross-reference the other side or sometihng
2014-07-26 21:52:15	@relsqui	can it morph?
2014-07-26 21:52:17	aliaras	DFC?
2014-07-26 21:52:20	@relsqui	double-face cards
2014-07-26 21:52:21	@mancat	i think i end up making flipped-version tokens
2014-07-26 21:52:23	@mancat	it's stupid
2014-07-26 21:52:26	@relsqui	like mayor of avabruck/howlpack alpha
2014-07-26 21:52:30	@relsqui	mancat: I flipped it and added an annotation, but yeah
2014-07-26 21:52:31	@mancat	i'm pretty sure it can morph
2014-07-26 21:52:40	@relsqui	it had better becuase KHANS, BITCHES
2014-07-26 21:52:50	@mancat	oh my god why are they reprinting morph
2014-07-26 21:53:08	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-26 21:53:09	@mancat	one of the worst mechanics in terms of gameplay behavior
2014-07-26 21:53:15	@relsqui	I'm not a fan either, but I'm willing to wait and see
2014-07-26 21:53:31	@relsqui	my prediction right now is that first and last block of khans are alternate timelines of the same period
2014-07-26 21:53:34	@mancat	it's kind of cool conceptually, but it's a whole sack of game losses waiting to happen in comp REL
2014-07-26 21:53:36	@relsqui	wihch is why they don't draft together
2014-07-26 21:53:47	@mancat	that makes sense to me
2014-07-26 21:53:48	@relsqui	and one of them has dragons and the other does not
2014-07-26 21:53:54	@mancat	that also makes sense
2014-07-26 21:54:09	@relsqui	mancat: btw if letting your opponent make choices is bad why is browbeat so good
2014-07-26 21:54:18	@relsqui	I mean why do you not dislike it
2014-07-26 21:54:21	@relsqui	clearly it's good
2014-07-26 21:54:36	@mancat	because browbeat is JUST SO STRONG
2014-07-26 21:54:49	aliaras	relsqui: what's that hotkey?
2014-07-26 21:54:50	@mancat	i mean really it's because when it's in burn,your opponent doesn't actually get a choice
2014-07-26 21:54:57	@mancat	it's basically "take 5, or take more than 5"
2014-07-26 21:54:59	@relsqui	^G
2014-07-26 21:55:03	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-26 21:55:05	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-26 21:55:14	@relsqui	that's a good way to put it actually
2014-07-26 21:55:15	@mancat	i don't actually like it in most other decks
2014-07-26 21:55:18	@relsqui	three cards in a burn deck > 5 damage
2014-07-26 21:55:32	aliaras	yeah that's what I decided
2014-07-26 21:55:46	@mancat	i think i playe dit in Pyromancer for a little while, because when you get to double browbeat it's basicaly like casting Cruel Ultimatum for 3
2014-07-26 21:55:51	@mancat	but it wasn't even that great
2014-07-26 21:55:59	@mancat	!card ideas Unbound was better ultimately in that version
2014-07-26 21:56:00	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-26 21:56:03	@mancat	derp, lol
2014-07-26 21:56:06	@mancat	!card ideas Unbound

2014-07-26 21:56:41	@relsqui	whoa, nice
2014-07-26 21:56:48	@mancat	oh man is that a storm card :P
2014-07-26 21:56:51	@relsqui	... so if you don't have them you just got free cards?
2014-07-26 21:56:54	@relsqui	*_*
2014-07-26 21:57:01	@mancat	yeah :P
2014-07-26 21:57:11	@mancat	also bonus, it's arcane, so it's spliceable
2014-07-26 21:57:15	@relsqui	yuuuup
2014-07-26 21:57:19	@relsqui	I was noticing that about, ummm
2014-07-26 21:57:20	@mancat	i should see if i can reconstruct my arcane pyromancer list
2014-07-26 21:57:22	@relsqui	!card pyretic ritual

2014-07-26 21:57:23	@mancat	it was fun
2014-07-26 21:57:24	@relsqui	no, the other one
2014-07-26 21:57:29	@relsqui	the one that does that but it splices
2014-07-26 21:57:34	@mancat	!card Desperate Ritual
2014-07-26 21:57:34	oracle	Instant — Arcane, 1R (2)

2014-07-26 21:57:34	oracle	Splice onto Arcane {1}{R} (As you cast an Arcane spell, you may reveal this card from your hand and pay its splice cost. If you do, add this card's effects to that spell.)
2014-07-26 21:57:36	@mancat	^
2014-07-26 21:57:44	@mancat	and yeah, it played that hard
2014-07-26 21:57:45	@relsqui	thank you, yes
2014-07-26 21:57:56	@relsqui	I don't usually get to splice it because I don't usually have four mana when I'm playing it, lol
2014-07-26 21:58:01	@relsqui	but when I do it's a nice bonus
2014-07-26 21:58:25	@mancat	Pyromancer is pretty fun, it basically fits the storm archetype but it goes off with pyromancer's ascension instead of a storm deck
2014-07-26 21:58:30	@mancat	other than that it looks very similar
2014-07-26 21:58:39	@mancat	it plays a little different though
2014-07-26 21:59:24	@mancat	it plays the hell out of manamorphose and !card Gitaxian Probe
2014-07-26 21:59:24	oracle	Sorcery, {UP} (1)
2014-07-26 21:59:24	oracle	({UP} can be paid with either {U} or 2 life.)
2014-07-26 21:59:24	oracle	Look at target player's hand.
2014-07-26 21:59:24	oracle	Draw a card.
2014-07-26 21:59:55	@relsqui	-_- we both crit failed our game initiative roll
2014-07-26 22:00:02	@mancat	because "Discard this card: draw two cards and lose 2 life" is good, and so is "2: add four mna of any color to your mana pool and draw 2 cards"
2014-07-26 22:00:35	@relsqui	hmm
2014-07-26 22:00:39	@relsqui	mancat: when do you turn 1 faithless?
2014-07-26 22:00:41	@relsqui	I guess it depends on the deck
2014-07-26 22:00:44	@relsqui	but I was wondering that last game
2014-07-26 22:00:59	@relsqui	I feel like if I don't have anything in my hand I expect to want to discard I shouldn't
2014-07-26 22:01:10	@mancat	when i kept a crappy hand because it had >0 mountains and a faithless looting
2014-07-26 22:01:26	@mancat	that's a big part of why i play faithless looting, it makes bad hands keepable
2014-07-26 22:01:35	@relsqui	yeah fair
2014-07-26 22:01:40	aliaras	yeah, I just mulligan'd 6 lands and one thing worth playing
2014-07-26 22:01:43	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-26 22:01:47	@relsqui	aliaras: how many lands are you running?
2014-07-26 22:01:48	@mancat	when your hand is like [card], faithless looting, 3 mountains, it's suddenly fairly playable
2014-07-26 22:01:51	aliaras	relsqui: 25?
2014-07-26 22:01:55	@mancat	likewise for like 1 mountain, looting, and 3-4 drops
2014-07-26 22:01:57	@relsqui	you might wanna cut it back a little
2014-07-26 22:02:00	aliaras	nodnod
2014-07-26 22:02:03	aliaras	yeah, maybe
2014-07-26 22:02:04	@relsqui	or at least test that and see how you like it
2014-07-26 22:02:07	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-26 22:02:09	@relsqui	mancat: oh man, tuning land in the storm deck
2014-07-26 22:02:21	@relsqui	"let me try dropping to 20 ... still too many ... 18 ... I bet I can cut this more ..."
2014-07-26 22:02:25	@mancat	lol
2014-07-26 22:02:33	@relsqui	and then spirit guide happened
2014-07-26 22:02:35	@relsqui	and it's at TWELVE
2014-07-26 22:02:40	@relsqui	and I still skip land drops on purpose
2014-07-26 22:02:40	@mancat	that's gross
2014-07-26 22:02:49	@relsqui	just to feed faithless
2014-07-26 22:02:49	@mancat	wait why?
2014-07-26 22:02:51	@mancat	oh
2014-07-26 22:02:53	@mancat	lol
2014-07-26 22:02:54	@relsqui	or wild guess

2014-07-26 22:03:19	@mancat	dom: you're doing it wrong
2014-07-26 22:03:23	@mancat	go in the comb and take your pants off
2014-07-26 22:03:31	@dom	mancat: I know, but if I do that I wont write the paper
2014-07-26 22:03:35	@mancat	:P
2014-07-26 22:03:46	@relsqui	mancat: yep

2014-07-26 22:04:23	@dom	taking 2 fucking sinqs was the worst plan
2014-07-26 22:04:25	@relsqui	you guys aliaras is gonna be in town the weekend of the 8th
2014-07-26 22:04:27	@dom	especially online

2014-07-26 22:04:38	@relsqui	because we should go to fnm
2014-07-26 22:04:39	@relsqui	:P
2014-07-26 22:04:47	@dom	I'll be glad to add another follower to my entourage
2014-07-26 22:04:52	@dom	the old ones keep dying
2014-07-26 22:05:03	aliaras	relsqui: not gonna be in in time for fnm :P
2014-07-26 22:05:04	@relsqui	oh man I just saw how this game is going to go
2014-07-26 22:05:05	@relsqui	I had a vision
2014-07-26 22:05:05	aliaras	land at like 11:30
2014-07-26 22:05:08	@relsqui	aliaras: oH! okay
2014-07-26 22:05:10	@relsqui	never mind re bd then
2014-07-26 22:05:13	@relsqui	aliaras: where are you staying?
2014-07-26 22:05:20	aliaras	relsqui: nfi, need to sort that

2014-07-26 22:05:33	@relsqui	it can be with me if that turns out to be helpful :P
2014-07-26 22:05:53	@mancat	relsqui: i want to be like "play desperate ravings" but without blue it's probably not good
2014-07-26 22:05:54	aliaras	I wanna hang out with c some >____>
2014-07-26 22:06:01	@mancat	still there's got to be a better card than wild guess

2014-07-26 22:06:34	@relsqui	mancat: I'm playing all the draw and ritual I can find
2014-07-26 22:06:37	@relsqui	basically simic in red >___>

2014-07-26 22:07:00	aliaras	a girl :P
2014-07-26 22:07:05	@dom	close enough
2014-07-26 22:07:08	@dom	one point for dom
2014-07-26 22:08:18	@mancat	relsqui: tried Burning Inquiry?
2014-07-26 22:08:25	@mancat	probably not as good because it nets -1 card

2014-07-26 22:09:00	@mancat	ok
2014-07-26 22:09:12	@relsqui	what do you have against wild guess? :P
2014-07-26 22:09:14	@mancat	considered playing !card Dangerous Wager

2014-07-26 22:09:15	oracle	Discard your hand, then draw two cards.
2014-07-26 22:09:17	@relsqui	it's worth than faithless looting but so are most things
2014-07-26 22:09:21	@relsqui	*hell* no
2014-07-26 22:09:33	@relsqui	any time that's a good play for me, I'm already fucked :)
2014-07-26 22:09:35	@mancat	relsqui: it's good when your hand is only Dangerous Wager
2014-07-26 22:09:43	@mancat	define fucked
2014-07-26 22:09:57	@mancat	because i think you mean "I have one card left in hand and it's not dangerous wager"
2014-07-26 22:10:10	@relsqui	if my hand empties and I haven't won, I've lost
2014-07-26 22:10:13	@relsqui	:P
2014-07-26 22:10:37	@relsqui	the way that deck works is I bank cards until I have a grip full of rituals and my combo pieces
2014-07-26 22:10:42	@relsqui	and then drop my entire hand at once, swing, and win
2014-07-26 22:10:51	@relsqui	if I'm out of cards and I haven't won, something has not gone according to plan
2014-07-26 22:10:54	@relsqui	and it's very rarely recoverable
2014-07-26 22:11:29	 *	mancat tries to figure out what he has against dangerous wager
2014-07-26 22:11:37	@mancat	all i'm coming up with is it's a common from a core set :P
2014-07-26 22:11:59	@mancat	i think it's worse than faithless looting though, and that's bad
2014-07-26 22:12:08	@mancat	faithless looting is way good but it's not far form way bad
2014-07-26 22:12:28	@mancat	if it cost like 1 more mana on the first cast it would be not good
2014-07-26 22:12:34	@relsqui	against wild guess, you mean
2014-07-26 22:12:40	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-26 22:12:41	@mancat	that

2014-07-26 22:16:24	@relsqui	yes
2014-07-26 22:16:33	@relsqui	and me without my ankh, lol
2014-07-26 22:16:48	@relsqui	aliaras: this is really not the kind of control deck that's worth learning to plan for, but I don't have one of those
2014-07-26 22:16:51	@relsqui	so you got this one instead, haha
2014-07-26 22:16:56	aliaras	relsqui: yeah I know what the other kind is
2014-07-26 22:16:57	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 22:16:59	aliaras	it's interesting
2014-07-26 22:17:08	aliaras	I still can't decide if I should go play this deck tomorrow or what
2014-07-26 22:17:14	aliaras	or go to other people playing decks
2014-07-26 22:18:00	@relsqui	don't judge by this one. you're playing basically exactly what this deck is tuned to beat ^_^;
2014-07-26 22:18:05	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 22:18:13	aliaras	the burn deck hurts too :P
2014-07-26 22:18:16	aliaras	and I don't think control would go well
2014-07-26 22:18:20	@relsqui	well, yes, sort of by definition

2014-07-26 22:37:49	aliaras	relsqui's burn deck is strong.
2014-07-26 22:37:52	@relsqui	^_^
2014-07-26 22:37:56	@relsqui	I should proxy it
2014-07-26 22:38:03	@relsqui	I dunno if I'm going to bother proxying the storm deck
2014-07-26 22:38:04	@relsqui	because it's mean
2014-07-26 22:38:23	@relsqui	and not that interesting
2014-07-26 22:38:26	@dom	might push our meta dangerously far
2014-07-26 22:38:26	@relsqui	either it wins immediately or loses immediately
2014-07-26 22:38:38	@dom	then mancat would make a legacy blue deck
2014-07-26 22:38:43	@dom	and then we'd never win
2014-07-26 22:45:09	aliaras	haha
2014-07-26 22:46:54	Golem	You venture into the older formats at your own peril
2014-07-26 22:52:10	@relsqui	aliaras: good games btw <3
2014-07-26 23:09:59	@relsqui	http://38.media.tumblr.com/3a71411893432a9bf53305ab7434ad2d/tumblr_n9b7iywjOR1s9rpajo1_500.gif yup

2014-07-27 07:50:00	aliaras	okay I have two decks and I'm literally playing them against each other and it feels like taking two dolls and smashing them against each other going "boom boom boom"
2014-07-27 08:22:34	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-27 08:22:42	@relsqui	aliaras: that is called goldfishing and I have no idea why
2014-07-27 08:22:46	@relsqui	probably one of these guys knows ^
2014-07-27 08:34:22	aliaras	ok fuck it i'm gonna try losing at standard
2014-07-27 08:53:48	@relsqui	:D sweet! enjoy!
2014-07-27 09:06:33	@relsqui	there's been a lot of "why is the clan not centered on the center color instead of one of the paired enemies" and maro is like "I can't tell you yet"
2014-07-27 09:06:41	@relsqui	inb4 they're focused on the other color in the third set
2014-07-27 09:09:46	aliaras	relsqui: what's the order of operations of mulligan?
2014-07-27 09:10:03	aliaras	discard draw shuffle or shuffle draw?
2014-07-27 09:15:29	@relsqui	shuffle draw
2014-07-27 10:01:12	aliaras	nodnod
2014-07-27 10:01:26	aliaras	alao opened a http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373641, immediately put in deck
2014-07-27 10:01:37	aliaras	also
2014-07-27 10:02:20	aliaras	("elspeth? ok no but you're in")
2014-07-27 10:21:01	@relsqui	niiiiice
2014-07-27 10:21:14	@relsqui	yeah that is an excellent fit
2014-07-27 10:21:15	@relsqui	how'd it go!
2014-07-27 10:21:27	@relsqui	also, for channel in general: is sonic seizure worse than shock?
2014-07-27 10:21:31	 *	relsqui is changing stuff up in burn deck
2014-07-27 10:21:47	@relsqui	I feel like it's worse than shock, in a well-tuned deck, but I'm not sure how to math that
2014-07-27 10:23:37	@relsqui	there are times when it's good but they're less reliable
2014-07-27 10:24:27	@relsqui	I guess the math is "how much was that extra card worth"; if it would do three damage, and it probably would, it kind of cancels itself out
2014-07-27 10:24:33	@relsqui	*but* when it wouldn't it doesn't
2014-07-27 10:24:43	@relsqui	(like if my only other card is a mountain I don't need)
2014-07-27 10:25:20	@relsqui	maybe I want to run it but not four-of
2014-07-27 10:25:35	@relsqui	also unsure about: shard volley
2014-07-27 10:25:39	@relsqui	(this is how deep I'm digging into burn spells)
2014-07-27 10:26:52	@relsqui	ooh
2014-07-27 10:27:01	@relsqui	never mind, it's definitely worse than !card lightning axe
2014-07-27 10:27:02	oracle	Instant, R (1)
2014-07-27 10:27:02	oracle	As an additional cost to cast Lightning Axe, discard a card or pay {5}.
2014-07-27 10:27:02	oracle	Lightning Axe deals 5 damage to target creature.
2014-07-27 10:27:12	@relsqui	how did I not notice that one
2014-07-27 10:29:32	@relsqui	oh derp
2014-07-27 10:29:35	@relsqui	because just creatures never mind
2014-07-27 10:29:36	@relsqui	sad

2014-07-27 13:32:41	@relsqui	k!
2014-07-27 13:33:40	@relsqui	reason I ask is that, if you know what *kind* of thing you want, picking it out and buying it is higher ev but also less fun
2014-07-27 13:36:32	aliaras	relsqui: yep! I did some of both
2014-07-27 13:36:40	aliaras	I'm not gonna pick out and buy elspeth probably though :P

2014-07-27 13:38:02	@relsqui	I was about to say "I should see if I have anything you can use
2014-07-27 13:38:15	@relsqui	but ... probably nothing that it'd be cheaper for me to mail you than for you to buy
2014-07-27 13:38:18	@relsqui	lol

2014-07-27 14:00:04	@relsqui	I wouldn't prioritize life gain too highly. with a couple of specific exceptions it's not that valuable
2014-07-27 14:00:31	@relsqui	your life total doesn't win you the game, it's just another resource you can spend

2014-07-27 14:04:31	aliaras	relsqui: fair point :)
2014-07-27 14:04:56	aliaras	relsqui: http://deckstats.net/deck-4559027-ed3ac395eefcaee477ba90ff17b93565.html added what I have on sideboard
2014-07-27 14:05:11	@relsqui	remember you can just get more of the thing that's working already instead of finding more things to work with it
2014-07-27 14:05:15	aliaras	that's true
2014-07-27 14:05:51	@relsqui	not gonna phone that link but I'll look when I get home
2014-07-27 14:06:08	aliaras	which would argue for moving in a feral incarnation and siege wurm

2014-07-27 14:09:11	aliaras	vs. another guy who'd just started playing (!!!) and it went really well actually
2014-07-27 14:09:23	aliaras	our decks and skill levels were well matched, went 1-1 and then had to move on for time reasons
2014-07-27 14:09:36	@relsqui	nice
2014-07-27 14:10:26	aliaras	from one of those games: *attacks with nice creature* "Devouring Light, exile it". *turn* *attacks with other nice creature* "Devouring light, exile it" "...I really didn't think you'd have two in hand"
2014-07-27 14:10:50	aliaras	later: "yeah I shouldn't have done that that was dumb". Helpful experienced guy: "yeah...kinda was, sorry."
2014-07-27 14:11:41	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-27 14:12:16	aliaras	I had left mana up >_>
2014-07-27 14:13:04	@relsqui	sounds like you found good humans though which is rad
2014-07-27 14:13:16	aliaras	yeah
2014-07-27 14:14:32	aliaras	rules question: you can't use tap abilities of things when they're summoning-sick
2014-07-27 14:14:35	aliaras	but can you use them to convoke?
2014-07-27 14:16:16	@relsqui	yep!
2014-07-27 14:16:25	@relsqui	good question.
2014-07-27 14:16:26	aliaras	:D
2014-07-27 14:16:28	aliaras	awesome
2014-07-27 14:16:31	aliaras	(I did in a game today)
2014-07-27 14:16:42	@relsqui	OTHER things can tap them, they just can't tap themselves
2014-07-27 14:16:50	aliaras	tapped, played a 1-cost, then convoked with everything
2014-07-27 14:16:53	aliaras	so I got two things out
2014-07-27 14:17:02	@relsqui	nice
2014-07-27 14:17:07	@dom	omg I built a mwc control deck with sun titan and emeria the sky ruin combined with martyr of the sand
2014-07-27 14:17:17	@dom	gained like 20 life a turn
2014-07-27 14:17:26	@relsqui	hahaha neat
2014-07-27 14:17:50	aliaras	haha
2014-07-27 14:17:50	@relsqui	will look that shit up in a sec when not bus
2014-07-27 14:25:46	@relsqui	dom: martyr of the sand?
2014-07-27 14:33:47	@dom	yeah
2014-07-27 14:33:57	@dom	pay 1, sac and reveal for x times 3 life
2014-07-27 14:34:17	@dom	emeria the sky ruin and sun titan let me bring em back from gy every turn
2014-07-27 14:34:33	@dom	so do that with all 4 (this deck has moderate card draw)
2014-07-27 14:35:14	@relsqui	I can't find the card you're talking about

2014-07-27 14:36:34	@relsqui	got it. cool.
2014-07-27 14:36:59	@relsqui	unnnf dis starting hand. two mountains, three lava spikes, two ankhs of mishra
2014-07-27 14:37:00	@relsqui	and a firebolt
2014-07-27 14:37:05	@relsqui	no mull thx I'm good

2014-07-27 14:37:23	@relsqui	:D
2014-07-27 14:37:28	@relsqui	and next draw was a lightning bolt
2014-07-27 14:37:38	@relsqui	I think I could win without drawing any more cards at this point
2014-07-27 14:38:29	@relsqui	yup. played the second ankh, opponent played a land and dropped to eight, my next turn is little bolt big bolt spike and I'm done
2014-07-27 14:38:34	@relsqui	dgaf what I draw
2014-07-27 14:38:39	@relsqui	I'm enjoying this deck.
2014-07-27 14:39:01	@relsqui	I think I've got the land balance about right now
2014-07-27 14:39:07	@relsqui	it was too low for a while
2014-07-27 14:42:26	aliaras	I should really really really load up on "fuck your artifacts" cards and play you again :<
2014-07-27 14:42:39	aliaras	relsqui: actually, burn (or something else) vs new white/green variant? :D
2014-07-27 14:42:44	aliaras	prob not burn, I probably still lose
2014-07-27 14:43:26	@relsqui	haha. I wanna but I should do some actual work today -_-
2014-07-27 14:43:35	@relsqui	so I think I'm gonna run a couple more quick matches in forge and then knock it off
2014-07-27 14:43:40	@relsqui	if I get shit done, though, later :)
2014-07-27 14:44:45	aliaras	kay
2014-07-27 14:44:51	aliaras	how does forge work btw?
2014-07-27 14:45:00	@mancat	probably magnets
2014-07-27 14:45:06	aliaras	actual question :)
2014-07-27 14:45:13	@mancat	<-- actual smartass
2014-07-27 14:45:15	@mancat	:P sorry
2014-07-27 14:45:34	@mancat	relsqui probably has better context to answer that than me
2014-07-27 14:45:42	aliaras	yeah that was actually the wrong time, sorry
2014-07-27 14:46:02	 *	mancat butting into other pople's conversations again
2014-07-27 14:46:31	@mancat	he you looked at forge at all?
2014-07-27 14:46:33	@mancat	*have
2014-07-27 14:46:36	aliaras	no
2014-07-27 14:46:41	aliaras	's why I ask.
2014-07-27 14:47:02	 *	mancat wasn't sure whether that was a techincal or functional question
2014-07-27 14:47:05	@relsqui	lmao
2014-07-27 14:47:11	aliaras	functional.
2014-07-27 14:47:18	@mancat	so basically it's a java app that understands magic rules and has a card library and a card-playing AI
2014-07-27 14:47:26	@mancat	(which admittedly isn't super smart, but is okay)
2014-07-27 14:47:34	@mancat	it has a couple different modes
2014-07-27 14:47:35	aliaras	do you have to give it a deck to play?
2014-07-27 14:47:43	@mancat	it can simulate drafts and sealed deck events, which is cool
2014-07-27 14:47:50	@mancat	you can also just build decks and play against the computer
2014-07-27 14:47:53	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-27 14:48:04	@relsqui	aliaras: it has a bunch of decks already
2014-07-27 14:48:07	@relsqui	you can also give it a specific one
2014-07-27 14:48:14	@mancat	you can give it one of yours, one of the pre-generated ones forge comes with (there's a lot) or a programmatically-generated one
2014-07-27 14:48:29	@mancat	it also has a thing called quest mode which i really like
2014-07-27 14:48:35	@mancat	and you may also like
2014-07-27 14:48:43	@relsqui	if you want and mancat doesn't mind I can forward you a handful of deck lists that he sent me for learning/practicing/testing against different archetypes
2014-07-27 14:48:51	@mancat	it's good for people without comprehensive card knowledge
2014-07-27 14:49:03	@mancat	relsqui: not at all, they're not my decks :P
2014-07-27 14:49:07	@relsqui	mancat: IOW everyone except you
2014-07-27 14:49:08	@relsqui	:P
2014-07-27 14:49:15	@mancat	i just played them. they're pro decks.
2014-07-27 14:49:44	@mancat	relsqui: across the domain of people we urrently play magic with, more or less
2014-07-27 14:49:46	@relsqui	hehe
2014-07-27 14:50:09	@relsqui	hngh three browbeats in my hand, where are third mountain
2014-07-27 14:50:18	 *	relsqui loots, isn't sad
2014-07-27 14:50:21	@mancat	though i think NMcCoy and Golem have pretty complete mental databases too
2014-07-27 14:50:23	 *	relsqui is p. faithless though
2014-07-27 14:50:24	@relsqui	that's true.
2014-07-27 14:50:27	@mancat	:D it's hard to be sad after faithless looting
2014-07-27 14:50:28	aliaras	that's useful
2014-07-27 14:50:49	@relsqui	lol and THEN I draw a simian
2014-07-27 14:50:51	aliaras	relsqui: would take that thing
2014-07-27 14:50:59	@relsqui	aliaras: k! will bounce it along
2014-07-27 14:51:40	@relsqui	mancat: I'm running only 2 simians in my burn deck, is that crazy? I find that I don't tend to want them as much as permaland I can sac to fireblast, unlike storm deck, but it's nice to be able to pull them out for a turn one ankh or a last turn extra bolt
2014-07-27 14:52:08	@mancat	oh i didn't think about fireblast
2014-07-27 14:52:12	@mancat	yeah that makes a lot of ense
2014-07-27 14:52:25	@relsqui	mancat: note this is a different deck than we were talking about on friday
2014-07-27 14:52:31	@relsqui	that one's running four and loves 'em
2014-07-27 14:52:39	@mancat	this is burn?
2014-07-27 14:52:41	@relsqui	yes
2014-07-27 14:52:44	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-27 14:52:51	@mancat	i'm not actually sure i'd play simian at all
2014-07-27 14:52:56	@mancat	2 probably isn't a bad choice
2014-07-27 14:53:01	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-27 14:53:11	@relsqui	if I weren't it'd be, like, another mountain and another incinerate or something
2014-07-27 14:53:26	aliaras	mancat: not sure if you saw but my deck got an upgrade :D http://deckstats.net/deck-4559027-ed3ac395eefcaee477ba90ff17b93565.html
2014-07-27 14:53:36	@relsqui	mancat: why is three damage for two mana better than two for one? or is it?
2014-07-27 14:53:41	@relsqui	lightning strike vs. shock
2014-07-27 14:53:47	@mancat	it's kinda situational
2014-07-27 14:54:02	@mancat	if you're playing it as removal it depends what you'r expecting to face
2014-07-27 14:54:18	@mancat	if you're playing burn, 3 for 2 is probbaly better because what it really is is 3 damage for 1 card, vs. 2 damage for same cost
2014-07-27 14:54:21	@mancat	the mana is less important
2014-07-27 14:54:34	@relsqui	hm! that's a fair point
2014-07-27 14:54:37	@relsqui	hnnng fireblast
2014-07-27 14:54:41	@relsqui	fireblast and simian are my surprise cards
2014-07-27 14:54:45	@relsqui	"lol you thought I was done"
2014-07-27 14:54:48	@mancat	lol
2014-07-27 14:55:08	@relsqui	timing in this deck is weird
2014-07-27 14:55:13	@relsqui	I'm trying to play the instants on their turn just out of habit
2014-07-27 14:55:18	@relsqui	er ,to build the habit, I mean
2014-07-27 14:55:21	@relsqui	but most of the time it doesn't matter
2014-07-27 14:56:03	@mancat	if you wanna try other weird red decks you should look at AIR
2014-07-27 14:56:07	@relsqui	mm?
2014-07-27 14:56:11	@mancat	(All-In Red)
2014-07-27 14:56:21	@relsqui	(lol I think I just drew half of the lands in this deck. if my opponent's deck didn't suck I'd be dead by now)
2014-07-27 14:56:56	@mancat	i don't know it that well, but what i understand is it's common turn 1 is drop mountain, play like 3-4 rituals, hard-cast Chandra Ablaze, use her -2 and fuck your opponents' hand really hard while refreshing your own
2014-07-27 14:57:28	@relsqui	haha neat
2014-07-27 14:57:34	@relsqui	hm, the one on mtgs doesn't use chandra

2014-07-27 14:58:01	@relsqui	okay, real test time
2014-07-27 14:58:05	 *	relsqui runs burn against tempered steel
2014-07-27 14:58:38	@relsqui	lol ow
2014-07-27 14:59:28	@mancat	lol
2014-07-27 14:59:55	@mancat	how hard do you find R/B Vamps?
2014-07-27 14:59:56	@relsqui	I got really amazingly bad draws first game, second game going better
2014-07-27 14:59:59	@mancat	i'm not sure the AI plays it well
2014-07-27 15:00:03	@relsqui	yeah, I don't think it does
2014-07-27 15:00:07	@relsqui	I haven't found it too bad
2014-07-27 15:00:11	@mancat	it's a very persnickety deck
2014-07-27 15:00:22	 *	relsqui wastes a little burn on immolater and whatsisprotectionfromeverything, isn't sorry
2014-07-27 15:00:23	@mancat	it may also just be that that list is tuned too much for the standard metagame at that time
2014-07-27 15:00:57	@relsqui	hm! what was it like?
2014-07-27 15:01:09	@mancat	i don't remember :P
2014-07-27 15:01:12	@relsqui	ow balls
2014-07-27 15:01:14	@relsqui	I hate this deck
2014-07-27 15:01:15	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-27 15:01:17	@mancat	i'm pretty sure "slow" was a big part of it
2014-07-27 15:01:50	@mancat	and i think red was unplayable at the time
2014-07-27 15:01:56	 *	mancat thinks
2014-07-27 15:02:13	@relsqui	ow goddammit
2014-07-27 15:02:37	@mancat	i think that was right before they had a brief core set overlap that put Goblin Guide, Lightning Bolt, and Goblin Grenade in standard
2014-07-27 15:02:40	@relsqui	huh apparently I won a game in that match? I literally don't remember doing that but there were three games, so
2014-07-27 15:02:45	@relsqui	hee
2014-07-27 15:02:46	@mancat	i think also maybe Grim Lavamancer
2014-07-27 15:02:55	@relsqui	dear red, I got you this. love, wizards
2014-07-27 15:02:56	@mancat	that was like two months of "goblins is THE deck"
2014-07-27 15:03:50	@mancat	ug
2014-07-27 15:03:52	@mancat	i need to get out
2014-07-27 15:03:55	@relsqui	yeah I was talking to ubiquill today, he mentioned he used to play goblins back in the day
2014-07-27 15:03:59	@dom	come to fab?
2014-07-27 15:04:00	@relsqui	I was like "fyi that deck is still viable"
2014-07-27 15:04:01	@dom	:)
2014-07-27 15:04:05	@mancat	have a headache and everything hurts, sitting in bed is not helping me
2014-07-27 15:04:09	@relsqui	mancat: ... dude I texted you like twice with getting-out suggestions :)
2014-07-27 15:04:14	@relsqui	and then gave up and came home, lol
2014-07-27 15:04:19	 *	mancat looks for his phone
2014-07-27 15:04:39	@mancat	i really should pack :\

2014-07-27 16:50:04	@relsqui	but in the course of that happening ... I forget why heliod gets pissed at her, but he does. I think he thinks she was complicit in the overthrow of one of his cities
2014-07-27 16:50:08	@relsqui	which she wasn't, just wrong place at the wrong time
2014-07-27 16:50:27	@relsqui	anyway, so he takes back this spear he gave her and kills her with it
2014-07-27 16:50:50	@relsqui	which was kind of okay by her because she'd worked out a deal with erebos, god of the dead, to go to the underworld in the place of her slain lover
2014-07-27 16:51:07	@relsqui	but her friends were not too happy about it
2014-07-27 16:51:26	@relsqui	so elspeth is "dead" at this point in the story, but only as dead as anyone ever is in greek myth
2014-07-27 16:52:51	@relsqui	(there's more interesting details like what happened to the lover but I'm summarizing)

2014-07-27 17:18:52	@relsqui	aliaras: oh, do you want a script to turn decklists built/altered in forge into a format you can paste into deckstats etc?
2014-07-27 17:26:29	aliaras	relsqui: other way 'round would be good, actually!
2014-07-27 17:34:47	@relsqui	that it does by itself

2014-07-27 19:23:25	@relsqui	yessss
2014-07-27 19:23:30	@relsqui	aliaras: so they came up with this idea <_<
2014-07-27 19:23:32	@dom	no, half must be 5 dollar rare
2014-07-27 19:23:34	@relsqui	right
2014-07-27 19:23:36	@relsqui	^
2014-07-27 19:23:42	@relsqui	dom: wait does it have to be rare? I thought it was just any $5 card
2014-07-27 19:23:45	@relsqui	$%+
2014-07-27 19:23:46	@relsqui	er

2014-07-27 19:24:21	@dom	5 dollar rare is what we were saying
2014-07-27 19:24:24	aliaras	so it's one $5+ card and 59 others? :P
2014-07-27 19:24:39	@dom	under 10 dollars
2014-07-27 19:25:05	@dom	which is harder than it sounds
2014-07-27 19:25:09	@dom	but still fun and derpy
2014-07-27 19:25:44	@relsqui	I forget, were you counting lands? :P
2014-07-27 19:25:50	@relsqui	aliaras: note the *total* is under $10
2014-07-27 19:25:55	@relsqui	so you have $5 for one card and the rest of your $10 on whatever else
2014-07-27 19:27:15	@dom	not counting basic lands
2014-07-27 19:27:20	@dom	only basic lands

2014-07-27 19:29:43	@dom	are you gonna come down?
2014-07-27 19:29:48	@dom	or just play it later
2014-07-27 19:30:06	@dom	we're using ebay to search individual cards between 4.50 and 5.50
2014-07-27 19:30:20	@relsqui	hm. I could come down, it would take me a little bit

2014-07-27 19:59:19	@relsqui	dom: On a scale of 0-3 how many of you folks want in on pizza? I can grab it on my way down

2014-07-27 20:37:55	aliaras	blockers don't tap
2014-07-27 20:38:01	@relsqui	yep
2014-07-27 20:38:01	aliaras	so can I block and convoke with the same guy?
2014-07-27 20:38:03	@relsqui	fuck yeah you can
2014-07-27 20:38:06	@relsqui	as long as you block first
2014-07-27 20:38:07	aliaras	fuuuuuuuuuck
2014-07-27 20:38:12	aliaras	I should have done that ages ago :P

2014-07-27 20:43:48	aliaras	I keep getting owned by forge UI
2014-07-27 20:43:55	aliaras	is there a good way to see which of a stack is being targeted?
2014-07-27 20:44:03	aliaras	because I wanted to cast soemthingsomething valor on *that* guy
2014-07-27 20:46:33	@relsqui	not sure what you mean?
2014-07-27 20:46:39	aliaras	Show of Valor*

2014-07-27 20:46:43	oracle	Target creature gets +2/+4 until end of turn.
2014-07-27 20:46:52	aliaras	So I attack
2014-07-27 20:46:57	aliaras	with, say, three soldiers
2014-07-27 20:47:03	aliaras	one of them is blocked by another creature
2014-07-27 20:47:08	aliaras	but this was all a part of my cunning plan
2014-07-27 20:47:19	aliaras	how do I see which of the three soldiers, helpfully stacked in tiny form, is blocked?
2014-07-27 20:47:36	aliaras	oh wait
2014-07-27 20:47:39	aliaras	forge gets bigger.
2014-07-27 20:47:49	aliaras	still.

2014-07-27 20:52:35	@relsqui	yeah, should also tell you in the info box if they have effects

2014-07-27 21:13:19	aliaras	haha
2014-07-27 21:13:21	aliaras	interesting.
2014-07-27 21:14:53	@relsqui	aliaras: with your deck do you swing with the whole pile of tokens? or just use it to pump up your big things?
2014-07-27 21:16:17	aliaras	depends!
2014-07-27 21:17:03	@relsqui	fair answer!
2014-07-27 21:17:12	aliaras	on what the other deck is, on what's out-- if they can get through and I don't need them for mana either now or in your turn, I'll swing
2014-07-27 21:17:34	aliaras	also if you or mancat or anyone else have "Raise the Alarm" analogue ideas
2014-07-27 21:17:34	@relsqui	I wound up on campus anyway so I'm going through my cards >_> lol
2014-07-27 21:17:35	aliaras	wtb
2014-07-27 21:17:36	aliaras	haha
2014-07-27 21:17:44	@relsqui	lemme check format of some things
2014-07-27 21:25:22	@relsqui	karmabot: comp rules =~ /mulligan/
2014-07-27 21:25:22	karmabot	Huh?
2014-07-27 21:25:25	@relsqui	karmabot: comp rules
2014-07-27 21:25:25	karmabot	What?
2014-07-27 21:25:28	@relsqui	ugh
2014-07-27 21:25:30	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules)
2014-07-27 21:25:30	karmabot	comp rules(2): basically everything else is, though (205.3m), you can't use Redirect to make a counterspell target itself, but making it target the Redirect that's redirecting it is totally legit (114.4, 608.2k), if you manage to make an Aura enchant itself, the game will take it away and glare at you as a state-based action (303.4d), if the spell doesn't need targets you don't have to pick any (700.2c), you can't put one card in two piles (700.3a),
2014-07-27 21:25:30	karmabot	stop hitting yourself! lol (701.10c), if regeneration of a permanent is prevented, you can pay for it anyway if you want to (701.12c), you can't sacrifice someone else's creature (701.14a), templating is really important (701.15e), shuffling an empy library is still shuffling it (701.16f), you can't tap something that's tapped (701.17a)
2014-07-27 21:25:43	@relsqui	aliaras: meet karmabot, it's worse than bucket
2014-07-27 21:25:50	aliaras	haha
2014-07-27 21:26:13	@relsqui	also meet some selections from the comprehensive rules
2014-07-27 21:27:12	@relsqui	hey the beginning got cut off
2014-07-27 21:27:22	@relsqui	because the first one is in reference to "truck is not a creature type"
2014-07-27 21:31:31	aliaras	hahahaha
2014-07-27 21:31:46	aliaras	define:templating?
2014-07-27 21:34:14	@relsqui	aliaras: you notice how cards are worded very carefully/similarly?
2014-07-27 21:34:21	@relsqui	things that do the same thing aren't just worded alike, they're worded *identically*
2014-07-27 21:34:24	@relsqui	the rules for doing that are templating
2014-07-27 21:34:33	aliaras	nodnod
2014-07-27 21:34:34	@relsqui	if they're not literally machine-parseable they are very nearly so

2014-07-27 21:40:45	aliaras	yessssssss
2014-07-27 21:40:50	aliaras	ok new q
2014-07-27 21:41:00	aliaras	how do you buy cards like that
2014-07-27 21:41:19	@relsqui	aliaras: "dear store person at counter pls, can I has some guildgates? love aliaras"
2014-07-27 21:41:31	@relsqui	if you want a whole decklist you set it up in advance so they don't have to find them on the fly
2014-07-27 21:41:34	aliaras	nodnod
2014-07-27 21:41:36	@relsqui	but if you just want one card (or four of one card) you can just ask
2014-07-27 21:42:24	aliaras	enters tapped but not too bad for turn 1
2014-07-27 21:43:23	@relsqui	that's normal; if you get two colors, you have to trade something for it

2014-07-27 21:48:07	aliaras	haha
2014-07-27 21:53:50	@relsqui	aliaras: how much actual mana do you tend to have on hand? do you get late enough in the game that you have, like, eight to throw around?
2014-07-27 21:54:40	@relsqui	aliaras: relatedly, elvish mystics are also cheap and worth getting a playset of if you can use the green ramp
2014-07-27 21:54:43	@relsqui	but I have one and I'll send it to you
2014-07-27 21:54:45	aliaras	yeah especially if i find that green sorcery
2014-07-27 21:54:52	aliaras	can't really actually
2014-07-27 21:54:56	@relsqui	which one?

2014-07-27 21:55:38	@relsqui	huh?
2014-07-27 21:55:48	aliaras	the mystics
2014-07-27 21:55:56	@relsqui	don't feed?

2014-07-27 21:57:15	@relsqui	got it.
2014-07-27 21:57:44	aliaras	those are the big accelerators, everything else low mana is removal or a consolation prize

2014-07-27 21:59:05	aliaras	:D
2014-07-27 21:59:16	@relsqui	that's why I was asking about mana
2014-07-27 21:59:19	aliaras	that would play very well in the right game
2014-07-27 21:59:30	@relsqui	so probably not maindeck but maybe
2014-07-27 21:59:55	aliaras	yeah i have a convoke sorcery at 4G that gives me two lands
2014-07-27 22:00:05	aliaras	might get a full set of those

2014-07-27 22:00:47	aliaras	basically the above would copy the seraph or something else big
2014-07-27 22:01:04	@relsqui	no; copies a token
2014-07-27 22:01:11	aliaras	ohhh ok
2014-07-27 22:01:22	@relsqui	for the same reason I'm unsure about !card wake the reflections

2014-07-27 22:01:26	@relsqui	not worth it to copy a 1/1
2014-07-27 22:01:30	@relsqui	dunno how many big tokens you wind up with
2014-07-27 22:01:35	aliaras	some
2014-07-27 22:01:38	@relsqui	mancat doesn't like it, I'm on the fence
2014-07-27 22:01:53	aliaras	feral whassitcalled at 8G + convoke
2014-07-27 22:02:00	@relsqui	but I probably won't use 'em so I'll pass 'em along and you can think about it
2014-07-27 22:02:44	aliaras	honestly it's p good even at 1/1. mana neutral on that turn
2014-07-27 22:03:02	aliaras	because the bnew guy can fill in for the W
2014-07-27 22:03:08	aliaras	new*

2014-07-27 22:03:58	aliaras	need partial card search, heh
2014-07-27 22:04:45	aliaras	anyway
2014-07-27 22:04:48	aliaras	sleeps
2014-07-27 22:04:55	@relsqui	aliaras: re mana neutral, he points out: it's still a card
2014-07-27 22:05:02	@relsqui	the limiting factor in your deck, in theory, is card real estate
2014-07-27 22:05:05	aliaras	mmm
2014-07-27 22:05:07	aliaras	sure
2014-07-27 22:06:11	@relsqui	did we decide any of your token generators made humans?

2014-07-28 12:15:43	aliaras	i have one like that

2014-07-28 12:17:13	@relsqui	not exactly like that :)
2014-07-28 12:17:29	@relsqui	it's different in ways that make that one crazy good
2014-07-28 12:17:37	@relsqui	(I lied about being afk apparently, got caught up in text messages)
2014-07-28 12:18:10	aliaras	haha ok
2014-07-28 12:18:35	@relsqui	aliaras: if you wanna figure it out, look at what's different between that and yours; if you don't wanna I'll just tell you
2014-07-28 12:18:50	aliaras	relsqui: "tapped"
2014-07-28 12:19:05	@relsqui	that's the huge one, yeah.

2014-07-28 12:19:45	@relsqui	it's an intersecting set
2014-07-28 12:20:27	aliaras	relsqui: could get a dual-land?
2014-07-28 12:22:26	@relsqui	bingo
2014-07-28 12:22:36	@relsqui	it lets you fetch duals untapped
2014-07-28 12:22:39	aliaras	ahhhhh
2014-07-28 12:22:42	@relsqui	that card is like forty bucks
2014-07-28 12:22:44	@relsqui	and that's why
2014-07-28 12:22:59	aliaras	because the "and put it onto the battlefield" supercedes the tapped bit?
2014-07-28 12:23:39	aliaras	hrm. can't decide whether I should proxy shock lands to go with my proxy'd eslpeth I'll never buy, or stick to proxying "cards I want, would buy, and don't have yet" for this deck.
2014-07-28 12:23:52	@relsqui	er, rather; windswept itself comes in untapped and lets you fetch non-basics
2014-07-28 12:23:59	aliaras	ahhhhh
2014-07-28 12:24:00	aliaras	ok.
2014-07-28 12:24:10	@relsqui	if the card you fetch comes in tapped it still does
2014-07-28 12:25:22	aliaras	yeah, that's what I was wondering about.
2014-07-28 12:25:40	aliaras	so you would play that so you could go fetch whatever land you most needed, dual or not, at that time.
2014-07-28 12:26:37	aliaras	probably I will proxy elspeth and see if she's actually all that good + the dual lands I'd actually buy a playset of
2014-07-28 12:26:43	aliaras	esp since they're only around for like 3 more months or something

2014-07-28 12:42:31	aliaras	lol
2014-07-28 12:43:13	aliaras	so i'm gonna play 4 cheap duals, 2 elspeth, and will double-check/rearrange rest of my deck as needed
2014-07-28 12:43:19	aliaras	have a few things coming out
2014-07-28 12:43:35	aliaras	i probably won't actually ever get elspeth and put it in this deck, but it would be nice to know if she actually does work with it

2014-07-28 19:09:56	@relsqui	you won't beat most legacy decks, and that's okay; that's not what you're tuning for

2014-07-28 19:10:31	aliaras	yeah!
2014-07-28 19:10:35	aliaras	yeah I'm tuning for standard

2014-07-28 19:44:08	@relsqui	honestly? my favorite defense against counterspells is just *having more to do*
2014-07-28 19:44:10	@relsqui	not relying on any one card

2014-07-29 13:55:52	Golem	Woe to the uninitiated, that think drainpipe vermin and black cat are good cards

2014-07-29 14:03:15	oracle	Creature — Rat 1/1, B (1)
2014-07-29 14:03:15	oracle	When Drainpipe Vermin dies, you may pay {B}. If you do, target player discards a card.

2014-07-29 14:03:18	oracle	Creature — Zombie Cat 1/1, 1B (2)
2014-07-29 14:03:18	oracle	When Black Cat dies, target opponent discards a card at random.
2014-07-29 14:05:08	Golem	Yar, dont play those in a constructed deck if you can help it
2014-07-29 14:06:53	Golem	And if you DO play them, dont badmouth your opponent for winning.
2014-07-29 14:07:03	Golem	In fact, dont badmouth your opponent at all.
2014-07-29 14:07:08	Golem	Manners are important
2014-07-29 14:07:51	aliaras	hah, yeah
2014-07-29 14:08:45	aliaras	I'm new here, so I'm just going to check: one wouldn't play those because "discard a card" and "discard a random card" aren't very powerful for the mana (you get either their worst card or a random card, which probably wasn't that amazing, and they also could have just not drawn the amazing thing)
2014-07-29 14:09:49	Golem	partially
2014-07-29 14:10:10	Golem	discard a card is actually a fairly powerful ability, but in this case it comes with a few caviats
2014-07-29 14:10:34	Golem	first, you dont get to choose. Your opponent does (as opposed to something like !card thoughtsieze)
2014-07-29 14:10:34	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-29 14:10:37	Golem	bah
2014-07-29 14:10:50	Golem	!card thoughtseize
2014-07-29 14:10:51	oracle	Sorcery, B (1)
2014-07-29 14:10:51	oracle	Target player reveals his or her hand. You choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that card. You lose 2 life.
2014-07-29 14:11:11	Golem	A 1/1 creature tacked on doesnt help much, because its a 1/1.
2014-07-29 14:11:24	Golem	The second problem is the ability only activates when the creature dies
2014-07-29 14:11:55	Golem	Heres a tip that a lot of people dont realize: Your opponent generally has more control over when your creatures die than you do
2014-07-29 14:12:24	Golem	Because the creatures are 1/1, they are not particularly threatening and as such dont really die in combat if your opponent doesnt want them to.
2014-07-29 14:12:50	Golem	So they usually die only at the opponents whim...which is usually once their hand is already empty.
2014-07-29 14:13:01	Golem	And that brings us to the problem with discard in general
2014-07-29 14:13:22	Golem	you cant overload on it.  Sooner or later their hand will be empty and your discard spells wont be doing anything
2014-07-29 14:14:51	Golem	Since 90%+ of the discard in the game happens at sorcery speed, eventually your opponent will simply be playing whatever they draw anyways...and you will be stuck with a 1/1 for 1 or 2 that doesnt do anything while your opponent is casting relevant spells
2014-07-29 14:15:14	Golem	Thats the long version of the explanation anyways
2014-07-29 14:16:22	Golem	You should now be able to understand why !card divination is playable
2014-07-29 14:16:23	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-29 14:16:46	Golem	!card Divination
2014-07-29 14:16:47	oracle	Sorcery, 2U (3)
2014-07-29 14:16:47	oracle	Draw two cards.
2014-07-29 14:16:56	Golem	and !card Mind Rot is not
2014-07-29 14:16:57	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-07-29 14:17:02	Golem	I come to hate you oravle
2014-07-29 14:17:56	Golem	anyways you get the jist of my overly long explaination  I think
2014-07-29 14:30:41	@relsqui	lmao
2014-07-29 14:30:43	@relsqui	!card mind rot
2014-07-29 14:30:43	oracle	Sorcery, 2B (3)

2014-07-29 14:30:47	@relsqui	it just has to be the end of the line
2014-07-29 14:31:16	@relsqui	I would say mind rot is playable in limited, though? at least it passed the swear test for me at prerelease :P
2014-07-29 14:31:20	@relsqui	because in limited every card matters more
2014-07-29 14:33:15	@relsqui	ugh trying to vorthos, having trouble skimming to the bits of wiki I want
2014-07-29 14:34:53	@relsqui	also the writing on the wiki is so bad

2014-07-29 16:21:23	@relsqui	that's part of what I like about limited
2014-07-29 16:21:37	Golem	the best way I have heard the differance between card draw and discard is this:
2014-07-29 16:21:45	@relsqui	because you're making the most of what you've got you get to play a wider variety of things
2014-07-29 16:21:55	Golem	Card draw gives you more ways to win the game, discard gives your opponent fewer ways to win the game (sometimes)

2014-07-30 03:31:34	@dom	and I really gotta get my walls up (though ironically not wall of omens up for any of these decks)
2014-07-30 03:33:10	 *	relsqui kills the lifelinker the turn before tempered steel comes out, feels good
2014-07-30 03:33:12	Pash	Son, I am disappont.
2014-07-30 03:35:06	@relsqui	I wish you could scoop in forge :P I don't always wanna play out the last couple turns

2014-07-30 03:53:11	@dom	by the powers of gaining absurd amounts of life a turn, I am reborn into awesome-o!
2014-07-30 03:53:31	@dom	defeater of decks that I only play a couple times and then determine them inferior!
2014-07-30 03:53:35	@dom	Kek!
2014-07-30 04:00:57	 *	relsqui looks thoughtfully at !card sulfuric vortex
2014-07-30 04:00:58	oracle	Enchantment, 1RR (3)
2014-07-30 04:00:58	oracle	At the beginning of each player's upkeep, Sulfuric Vortex deals 2 damage to that player.
2014-07-30 04:00:58	oracle	If a player would gain life, that player gains no life instead.
2014-07-30 04:02:02	@relsqui	not sure if it's right for a deck that wants to be well underway by turn three
2014-07-30 04:02:06	@relsqui	dat lifegain hate tho
2014-07-30 05:30:12	aliaras	relsqui: re what would you run it with, there's a {G} green buff spell maybe? but then you're running a lot of cards for it

2014-07-30 12:08:16	@relsqui	isn't it? :D
2014-07-30 12:08:22	@relsqui	also, re logo design
2014-07-30 12:08:23	@relsqui	> We have a student-run Graphic Design Center on campus that you could also use.  They charge $10/hour and the first 5 hours are free, so it can save a lot of money. You don't have to use them, though.  The first step would be to get an estimate and then submit it with a budget request to the OBC.
2014-07-30 12:16:31	@relsqui	that's probably a really good deal, if they do good work?

2014-07-30 14:29:22	@mancat	by graphic design center, they mean like they will design stuff for you?
2014-07-30 14:29:54	@mancat	i'm inclined to agree, if that's what it is. sounds like what we need, and it seems rather cosmopolican
2014-07-30 14:30:01	@mancat	*cosmopolitan
2014-07-30 14:30:11	@relsqui	yeah; see link
2014-07-30 14:33:14	@mancat	i like
2014-07-30 14:33:46	@relsqui	me too
2014-07-30 14:33:55	@mancat	kinda modern, mostly flat primary colors, but the composition is good, and that style is easy to onvert to various mediums (like pants) so I approve
2014-07-30 14:34:06	@relsqui	XD lol pants
2014-07-30 14:34:18	@mancat	the magic pants the magic pants the magic pants the magic pants
2014-07-30 14:35:04	@relsqui	I really deeply want to make that happen and I'm not sure how it can be done remotely feasibly
2014-07-30 14:35:23	@relsqui	like there's no way it's not absurdly expensive
2014-07-30 14:35:39	@mancat	have you heard how we have several thousand dollars to blow on frovlities?

2014-07-30 14:37:27	@mancat	such luxury!
2014-07-30 14:37:35	@relsqui	that sounds awesome
2014-07-30 14:37:46	@mancat	it's basically awesome
2014-07-30 14:38:18	@relsqui	sweatpants ... track pants ... uniform pants ...
2014-07-30 14:38:27	 *	mancat wants embroidered jeans
2014-07-30 14:38:43	 *	mancat only wears jeans and slacks, and slacks only when the jeans are all dirty
2014-07-30 14:39:02	@mancat	on the other hand, embroidered jeans are kinda tacky
2014-07-30 14:39:03	 *	mancat sigh
2014-07-30 14:39:11	@mancat	i'm trying to picture the perfect magic pants right now
2014-07-30 14:39:19	@relsqui	yeah I'm like
2014-07-30 14:39:20	@mancat	i'm not really sure what they look like
2014-07-30 14:39:21	@relsqui	researching
2014-07-30 14:39:21	@relsqui	on desk
2014-07-30 14:39:47	@mancat	but i'm pretty sure they have some kind of logo sort of plastered across and around one thigh and possibly the butt, kinda off-center
2014-07-30 14:39:50	@mancat	mana symbols
2014-07-30 14:39:53	@mancat	with like
2014-07-30 14:39:59	@mancat	and not with a psu logo
2014-07-30 14:40:08	@relsqui	I'm assuming we can't actually do mana symbols
2014-07-30 14:40:09	@relsqui	I should find out
2014-07-30 14:40:12	@mancat	oh
2014-07-30 14:40:12	@mancat	yeah
2014-07-30 14:40:16	@mancat	that's totally a thing actually
2014-07-30 14:40:21	@mancat	well
2014-07-30 14:40:22	@mancat	hm
2014-07-30 14:40:29	@mancat	they probably won't make it
2014-07-30 14:40:51	@mancat	i think we could buy it and give it away if we aren't selling them, but i think it's a copyright violation for the manufacturer to make them and sell them
2014-07-30 14:40:57	@relsqui	yeah
2014-07-30 14:41:07	@mancat	afaik it's fair-use for us, but not for them, cuz money
2014-07-30 14:41:34	@relsqui	I don't think it's even fair use for us
2014-07-30 14:41:39	@relsqui	noncommercial isn't sufficient reason
2014-07-30 14:41:50	@mancat	if we're not making money or using it as self-promotion i'm pretty sure it's fair use
2014-07-30 14:42:09	@relsqui	so far the best I have is http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Custom-printed-jeans-hot-pants-KTJ_1503819426.html
2014-07-30 14:42:45	@relsqui	oh, looks like the same company does some variety of those
2014-07-30 14:43:14	@relsqui	I mean the actual problem is not just getting them made it's sizing them; pants sizing is way more complicated than shirt sizing
2014-07-30 14:43:18	@relsqui	butts are hard, yo
2014-07-30 14:43:42	@mancat	lol

2014-07-30 14:43:56	@mancat	the more i htink about it the more i realize i wouldn't wear these
2014-07-30 14:44:10	@relsqui	haha
2014-07-30 14:44:29	@mancat	i'm actually super picky about my pants, which is why i'm always wearing shitty ratty pants
2014-07-30 14:44:33	@mancat	the ones i would buy are like $50
2014-07-30 14:44:33	@relsqui	oh hey I found the interchangeable size things http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Sexy-Designer-Zip-Around-Interchangeable-USA_10864313.html
2014-07-30 14:44:39	@relsqui	sides*
2014-07-30 14:44:48	@dom	the situation about pants is that if they aren't jeans, there is likely a reason for someone to not wear them
2014-07-30 14:46:44	@relsqui	oh oh oh
2014-07-30 14:46:51	@relsqui	speaking of money
2014-07-30 14:46:53	@relsqui	and good uses of it
2014-07-30 14:47:08	@mancat	but yeah, i think we should talk to the graphics people soon
2014-07-30 14:47:15	@relsqui	I was thinking about how we could run a draft in a way that neither requires students buy packs from us nor requires us to give them away
2014-07-30 14:47:19	@relsqui	and I think it's
2014-07-30 14:47:28	@relsqui	"you can buy packs from us and keep the cards, or we'll hand you packs to play with and we keep the cards"
2014-07-30 14:47:32	@mancat	we should see if they'll sit down with us and help us work out a design or if we need to just like bring some ideas to them and let them run with it
2014-07-30 14:47:39	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-30 14:47:49	@relsqui	mancat: do you have the time/energy to deal with that?
2014-07-30 14:47:57	@relsqui	I can do it but if I can avoid having another thing on my plate right now I'd like that
2014-07-30 14:48:04	@mancat	yeha i can probably do that after this weekend
2014-07-30 14:48:12	@relsqui	oh right you have that to deal with right now >_>
2014-07-30 14:48:16	@mancat	by monday i should be pretty settled

2014-07-30 14:54:01	@mancat	the dryer has like two buttons: select temperature, and start
2014-07-30 14:54:12	@mancat	and a card reader, that reads "$0.25 / 6 min"
2014-07-30 14:54:18	@mancat	but no way to select how much time
2014-07-30 14:54:26	@dom	wat
2014-07-30 14:54:39	@mancat	i guess you're supposed to just swipe your card and make one $0.25 charge for every 6 minute increment you want?
2014-07-30 14:54:53	 *	mancat swiped his card once, got 6 minutes, and then just put in quarters til it stopped taking them
2014-07-30 14:54:56	@mancat	stupid machine

2014-07-30 14:58:37	@relsqui	the one at my apartment is pretty neat
2014-07-30 15:01:02	 *	mancat listens to some hipster girl at the laundromat complain that everyone said REM is their favorite band
2014-07-30 15:01:28	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-30 15:01:34	 *	mancat infers (with circumstantial evidence) that this hipster girl is a *real* REM fan, and probably liked them before it was cool, and that she's bothered that eveyrone else is trying to be like her
2014-07-30 15:01:54	@relsqui	tell her I said I don't particularly care for REM if it makes her feel better
2014-07-30 15:01:59	 *	mancat has been a fan of REM since he was like 8, but elects not to get emotionally attached to her complaining
2014-07-30 15:02:05	@relsqui	lol
2014-07-30 15:02:14	@relsqui	aw, not going to start a stupid conversation on my behalf

2014-07-30 22:43:16	@relsqui	last time -- I think I said this to mancat -- I was playing a little more defensively than necessary but not outright handing it to him or anything
2014-07-30 22:43:20	@relsqui	give him a warmup
2014-07-30 22:43:33	@relsqui	and then midgame the balance of power shifted and I had to fight back pretty hard and still lost
2014-07-30 22:43:43	@relsqui	which was good! satisfying game with someone who doesn't know it super well
2014-07-30 22:43:58	@relsqui	so we played three games tonight, white v. black and two red v. green

2014-08-01 12:42:37	@relsqui	re commander planeswalkers
2014-08-01 12:42:39	aliaras	relsqui: error: I am at work ---> building ikea furniture / dinner with reuven parents.
2014-08-01 12:42:43	@relsqui	gotcha
2014-08-01 12:42:43	aliaras	relsqui: :( :( :(
2014-08-01 12:42:55	aliaras	also when not doing that I should really really keep reading up on D&D because I'm gonna play this
2014-08-01 12:42:57	@relsqui	"go ahead and cheer for gisa she's awesome"
2014-08-01 12:43:06	@relsqui	well ... I mean psychotic and horrifying
2014-08-01 12:43:07	@relsqui	but yes, awesome
2014-08-01 12:43:11	aliaras	also the same writing that makes templating good makes really terrible rulebook reading
2014-08-01 12:43:14	aliaras	jussayin'
2014-08-01 12:43:30	@relsqui	terrible as in dry?
2014-08-01 12:43:37	@relsqui	also are you reading the player-facing rules or the comprehensive rules?
2014-08-01 12:44:24	aliaras	reading the player's handbook
2014-08-01 12:44:26	aliaras	and dry, yes
2014-08-01 12:44:36	aliaras	trying to note down everything I'll need for actually doing turns
2014-08-01 12:44:48	@mancat	aliaras: which edition?
2014-08-01 12:44:50	@relsqui	oh for D&D
2014-08-01 12:44:53	@relsqui	missed that jump
2014-08-01 12:44:54	@mancat	i can probably summaize for you
2014-08-01 12:45:03	aliaras	3.5
2014-08-01 12:45:03	@mancat	if tha's useful
2014-08-01 12:45:07	@mancat	:(
2014-08-01 12:45:09	@relsqui	hahahaha "so I've been playing magic since 1995" maro leans over to the mic "noob"
2014-08-01 12:45:10	aliaras	and nah, don't have the background
2014-08-01 12:45:13	aliaras	haha
2014-08-01 12:45:17	@relsqui	shut up maro
2014-08-01 12:45:18	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-01 12:45:21	@mancat	lol
2014-08-01 12:46:44	@relsqui	dammit. when they introduced spellslingers I was like "meh this sounds stupid" but the trailer looks pretty goofy
2014-08-01 12:47:14	@relsqui	(youtube show of people playing magic, that's it)
2014-08-01 12:47:30	@relsqui	"is anybody here interested in hearing about khans of tarkir?" predictable reaction
2014-08-01 12:47:35	@relsqui	"okay that's good because we're planning to talk about it"
2014-08-01 12:54:38	@relsqui	.... oh, weird ......
2014-08-01 12:54:47	@relsqui	khans of tarkir the *set* is about wedges
2014-08-01 12:54:48	@relsqui	the *block* is not
2014-08-01 12:54:52	@relsqui	what on earth.
2014-08-01 12:54:53	@relsqui	I mean
2014-08-01 12:54:55	@relsqui	what on tarkir.
2014-08-01 12:55:02	@relsqui	that's very curious.
2014-08-01 12:56:11	@relsqui	also "it's a block about change"
2014-08-01 12:56:19	@relsqui	relevant to morph, perhaps
2014-08-01 13:00:06	aliaras	why not do a whole block based on wedges?
2014-08-01 13:00:19	@relsqui	for Plot Reasons we don't know yet
2014-08-01 13:00:21	@relsqui	is the implication
2014-08-01 13:01:01	@relsqui	"the mechanic for the [the jeskai] will make your opponent doubt what's going on" calling it for ninjutsu
2014-08-01 13:01:06	@relsqui	actually I don't know if they mean new ones
2014-08-01 13:01:34	@relsqui	if not, then ninjutsu
2014-08-01 13:02:46	@relsqui	"Sidisi would love to gather all the clans under one banner, as long as that banner was huge and said 'Sidisi' on it"
2014-08-01 13:03:30	@relsqui	tell me to stfu if this is annoying
2014-08-01 13:04:05	@relsqui	"[the mardu] combine lightning magic with archery" it's like they got me a present
2014-08-01 13:07:28	@relsqui	"this is the khan of a temur, who bested a savage bear in single combat with his ... um .... I don't want to say bare hands -_-"
2014-08-01 13:07:32	@dom	sultai and temur obviously best
2014-08-01 13:07:35	@relsqui	"was that a werebear callback twelve years in the making?"
2014-08-01 13:09:37	@relsqui	ooh clan pins inside the prerelease boxes
2014-08-01 13:15:15	@relsqui	"has your playtesting gotten better to help shit like jace from happening again?" <_<
2014-08-01 13:15:35	@relsqui	short answer: yes, it has.
2014-08-01 13:15:44	@dom	long answer: nope
2014-08-01 13:15:52	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-01 13:16:16	@dom	I mean I agree that jace is gross but theros was a painful block
2014-08-01 13:16:28	@dom	i'd rather have powerful cards than shit ones >>
2014-08-01 13:21:18	@dom	hmmm, a lot of decks online run 21-24 lands, not the baseline 20 that I always run
2014-08-01 13:21:51	@dom	they also run a lot of special lands, but I've never been manascrewed and it feels like most cards are better than lands
2014-08-01 13:28:42	aliaras	relsqui: "shit like jace"?
2014-08-01 13:29:00	aliaras	dom: I've been manascrewed hard but also you're not wrong there
2014-08-01 13:32:54	@dom	also, which jace? AOT?
2014-08-01 13:33:56	@dom	tms?
2014-08-01 13:34:31	@dom	might be tms, that shit looks broken
2014-08-01 13:34:39	@dom	!card jace, the mind sculptor
2014-08-01 13:34:39	oracle	Planeswalker — Jace (Loyalty: 3), 2UU (4)
2014-08-01 13:34:39	oracle	+2: Look at the top card of target player's library. You may put that card on the bottom of that player's library.
2014-08-01 13:34:39	oracle	0: Draw three cards, then put two cards from your hand on top of your library in any order.
2014-08-01 13:34:39	oracle	-1: Return target creature to its owner's hand.
2014-08-01 13:34:39	oracle	-12: Exile all cards from target player's library, then that player shuffles his or her hand into his or her library.
2014-08-01 13:34:55	@dom	"you don't get a library, lol"
2014-08-01 13:47:51	@relsqui	yeah, jtms famously broken. ask mancat for rant
2014-08-01 13:48:11	@dom	jaot doesn't seem that broken >>
2014-08-01 13:48:22	@dom	!card jace, architect of thought
2014-08-01 13:48:23	oracle	Planeswalker — Jace (Loyalty: 4), 2UU (4)
2014-08-01 13:48:23	oracle	+1: Until your next turn, whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks, it gets -1/-0 until end of turn.
2014-08-01 13:48:23	oracle	-2: Reveal the top three cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other on the bottom of your library in any order.
2014-08-01 13:48:23	oracle	-8: For each player, search that player's library for a nonland card and exile it, then that player shuffles his or her library. You may cast those cards without paying their mana costs.
2014-08-01 13:49:33	aliaras	jaot is annoying as shit vs. my deck
2014-08-01 13:49:38	aliaras	and yes curious about rant
2014-08-01 14:13:57	@relsqui	<_< I <3 my team
2014-08-01 14:14:22	@relsqui	our meetings have exactly the right proportion of fucking off
2014-08-01 14:14:24	@relsqui	:P
2014-08-01 14:21:17	@relsqui	also waugh my hand itches
2014-08-01 14:21:24	@relsqui	(covered in henna because my coworker is rad)
2014-08-01 14:26:53	@dom	so as far as our meta goes, I'm staying under $100
2014-08-01 14:27:12	@dom	deckstats is pretty wrong though, and I dont wanna calculate by hand, even though I know its way off >>
2014-08-01 14:27:23	@dom	sorry buddy, city of brass is not $10 a pop
2014-08-01 14:44:39	@relsqui	haha yeah
2014-08-01 14:44:52	@relsqui	deckbox.org is better because it uses its own acual trade prices
2014-08-01 14:44:56	@relsqui	actual*
2014-08-01 16:15:26	Golem	Note to self: green devotion vs red devotion is heavily in green's favor
2014-08-01 16:19:09	@dom	red devotion is a thing?
2014-08-01 16:20:40	@dom	I think green might be so prevalent in our meta because its so full of goodstuff >>
2014-08-01 16:41:52	aliaras	i should use this "deckbox"
2014-08-02 13:41:19	sabreman	Just wondering
2014-08-02 13:41:27	sabreman	is there something like forge, but for multiplayer?
2014-08-02 13:43:25	@relsqui	sabreman: I mean, there's the official MTGO :)
2014-08-02 13:43:44	@relsqui	there's also Cockatrice, which is free, but doesn't know the rules, it just gives you a table and card info
2014-08-02 13:48:28	sabreman	well I'd rather not drop 40$ on a game this very second
2014-08-02 13:48:36	sabreman	(once  I learn this stuff better sure)
2014-08-02 13:48:44	sabreman	but till then cockatrice it is
2014-08-02 13:48:49	sabreman	relsqui thanks
2014-08-02 13:49:10	@relsqui	np
2014-08-02 15:35:22	sabreman	is there any reason why forge is refusing to download 412 cards?
2014-08-02 15:35:26	sabreman	it keeps skipping them
2014-08-02 15:35:30	sabreman	also all of the quest images...
2014-08-02 16:19:16	sabreman	nvm, it's cause the'yre from this years set and magiccard.info doesnt have them yet
2014-08-02 16:19:17	sabreman	or something
2014-08-02 16:19:38	@dom	yeah, basically
2014-08-02 16:19:53	@dom	also, oracle (the program forge uses to update itself) is kinda derpy too
2014-08-02 16:59:32	@mancat	derp so hard
2014-08-02 17:03:25	@dom	http://www.twitch.tv/magic
2014-08-02 17:19:27	aliaras	RELSQUI
2014-08-02 17:19:32	aliaras	I JUST OPENED A *FOIL* ELSPETH
2014-08-02 17:20:18	@dom	ye gads
2014-08-02 17:20:42	aliaras	dom: ftr i put two elspeths in this deck as a "eh, I'll never play it, but let's see how it works" (a: amazeballs when I can cast it)
2014-08-02 17:20:54	@dom	sure
2014-08-02 17:20:56	aliaras	so the reason I bought a theros pack at all was "more cards-- maybe elspeth?"
2014-08-02 17:21:02	@dom	kek
2014-08-02 17:21:04	aliaras	and made a face like O_______O
2014-08-02 17:21:10	@dom	nice :)
2014-08-02 17:21:10	aliaras	I was having a really shitty day too
2014-08-02 17:21:20	@dom	yeah, opening packs makes me feel good too
2014-08-02 17:21:38	aliaras	gonna see if I can in fact trade her for 2x elspeth
2014-08-02 17:21:41	aliaras	and just play that
2014-08-02 17:22:11	@dom	foils aren't usually worth that much more I don't think
2014-08-02 17:22:21	@dom	but I'm no expert
2014-08-02 17:22:28	aliaras	what's the canonical price lookup for just internet?
2014-08-02 17:23:10	@dom	tcgplayer.com
2014-08-02 17:23:17	aliaras	okay
2014-08-02 17:23:19	aliaras	my other pack
2014-08-02 17:23:21	aliaras	just had an elspeth
2014-08-02 17:23:25	aliaras	holy fuckin' shit
2014-08-02 17:23:25	@dom	if you look it up in magiccards.info and click the prices
2014-08-02 17:23:27	@dom	LOL
2014-08-02 17:23:35	aliaras	y'know, just a *regular* elspeth
2014-08-02 17:23:42	@dom	a pleb elspeth
2014-08-02 17:23:44	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-02 17:23:46	aliaras	seriously
2014-08-02 17:23:48	aliaras	day
2014-08-02 17:23:49	aliaras	turned
2014-08-02 17:23:49	aliaras	around
2014-08-02 17:24:00	@dom	:( -> (:
2014-08-02 17:24:01	aliaras	gonna tune this deck a bit more and wreck some shit B)
2014-08-02 17:24:35	@dom	seargent, whats the status of this shit?
2014-08-02 17:24:39	@dom	sir, its rekt!
2014-08-02 17:24:40	aliaras	relsqui: also I now have that selesnya guildgate playset
2014-08-02 17:24:42	aliaras	:D
2014-08-02 17:26:33	aliaras	yeah ok so foil elspeth is min $33.99, reg. is $18.35
2014-08-02 17:26:39	@dom	not bad
2014-08-02 17:26:54	aliaras	so that's not two elspeths but it is $15 of cards
2014-08-02 17:27:51	aliaras	also I got an Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver
2014-08-02 17:27:57	aliaras	in the one that had the foil elspeth
2014-08-02 17:27:58	aliaras	so um
2014-08-02 17:28:00	aliaras	I'm doing good!
2014-08-02 17:28:09	@dom	nice
2014-08-02 17:28:25	@dom	I gotta go to timevault soon, I have an ajani just declining in price
2014-08-02 17:28:30	@dom	foil ajani, I mean
2014-08-02 17:30:05	aliaras	oh wait the Ashiok isn't nearly so valuable when he's just normal
2014-08-02 17:30:07	aliaras	still
2014-08-02 17:30:10	aliaras	not complaining
2014-08-02 17:34:45	aliaras	...I still have to deal with ikea furniture though :(
2014-08-02 18:32:39	@relsqui	aliaras: get shoofle! she loves doing that >_>
2014-08-02 18:32:47	aliaras	haha
2014-08-02 18:32:49	aliaras	I remember!
2014-08-02 18:32:51	@relsqui	^_^
2014-08-02 18:35:34	aliaras	also it helps that foil elspeth isn't like, the best foil ever, just shiny >_>
2014-08-02 18:35:38	aliaras	otherwise I'd be tempted to just keep it
2014-08-02 18:37:50	@relsqui	haha, yeah
2014-08-02 18:38:05	@relsqui	one of the reasons it was easy to sell the foil chord is, like, I wouldn't mind just having a regular chord if I wanted one
2014-08-02 18:38:15	@relsqui	<_< but good luck getting my foil chandra's phoenix
2014-08-02 18:48:23	@relsqui	dom: I also have stuff to sell I wanna come >_> but not, like, this weekend, so if you actually mean soon then don't wait for me
2014-08-02 19:26:16	@dom	relsqui: I dont care how soon it is, I'd like to do it soon, but thats really it
2014-08-02 19:26:19	@dom	monday?
2014-08-02 19:26:24	@relsqui	sure :)
2014-08-02 19:27:41	@dom	when do you tutor on monday, if at all
2014-08-02 19:27:41	@dom	?
2014-08-02 19:41:20	@dom	relsqui ^
2014-08-02 19:41:30	@relsqui	oh sorry
2014-08-02 19:41:41	@relsqui	I don't, nothing scheduled before D&D (yayyy)
2014-08-02 19:45:43	@dom	maximum kek
2014-08-02 20:04:51	@relsqui	huh, missed a practice test question that I was pretty confident about
2014-08-02 20:04:53	 *	relsqui squints at it
2014-08-02 20:05:31	@dom	wat wuz it
2014-08-02 20:05:45	@relsqui	not actually allowed to tell you, but it hinges on the distinction between losing life and being dealt damage
2014-08-02 20:06:04	@relsqui	yeahh
2014-08-02 20:06:08	 *	relsqui refreshes memory on the relevant rules
2014-08-02 20:06:40	@relsqui	misremembered that; I was thinking of the rules that say e.g. if your life total is "set" to a specific number lower than its previous number, that counts as "losing life"
2014-08-02 20:06:54	@relsqui	but something which causes you to "lose life" has not caused you to "take damage"
2014-08-02 20:06:55	@dom	but not taking damage
2014-08-02 20:06:58	@dom	yeah
2014-08-02 20:06:58	@relsqui	right.
2014-08-02 20:08:32	@relsqui	I keep forgetting to read the tournament rules
2014-08-02 20:08:39	@relsqui	but I'm getting better at answering questions about them anyway, lol
2014-08-02 20:08:41	@relsqui	they're pretty sensible
2014-08-02 20:09:03	@relsqui	(and I got one about sideboarding, which is easy)
2014-08-02 20:09:09	@relsqui	so that life loss thing is the only one I got wrong :)
2014-08-02 20:09:21	@dom	kek
2014-08-02 20:11:01	 *	relsqui hasn't yet given up on dreams of, at least, L0, just hasn't been making time for it lately
2014-08-02 20:11:09	@relsqui	there were a couple I was very unsure about which I got right, though
2014-08-02 20:11:39	@relsqui	needs moar studying
2014-08-02 20:14:29	aliaras	relsqui: favorite flavor text: http://magiccards.info/m10/en/180.html
2014-08-02 20:14:36	aliaras	l0?
2014-08-02 20:18:59	@relsqui	hahaha great
2014-08-02 20:21:21	@relsqui	aliaras: there are "levels" of judges, which reflects how experienced and knowledgeable they are. L5 is basically working directly for the DCI
2014-08-02 20:21:31	@relsqui	the lowest is L1, the local judge
2014-08-02 20:21:42	@relsqui	but there's also a "rules adviser" role which you can just test into online
2014-08-02 20:21:54	@relsqui	with a multiple-choice game rules and tournament rules test
2014-08-02 20:22:08	@relsqui	I don't think it's officially called L0 but it is colloquially
2014-08-02 20:23:13	@relsqui	deets: http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/resources/info
2014-08-02 21:48:11	Golem	This pro tour makes me excited for standard again
2014-08-02 21:48:14	Golem	so many spicy brews
2014-08-02 21:48:45	Golem	Plus is has one of my favorite names for a g/r devotion deck thus far:

2014-08-02 21:52:31	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-02 22:09:55	Golem	4 Polukranos and 4 Genesis Hydra with a few Mistcutter Hydras in the board.  Seems appropriate ^_^
2014-08-02 22:13:26	@relsqui	^_^
2014-08-02 22:29:34	Golem	Gods thats a spicy top 8
2014-08-02 22:29:55	Golem	first seed is a white weeny-esque Naya Aggro deck
2014-08-02 22:30:59	Golem	and the rest is 2 Jund Planeswalker decks, another GW aggro deck, 2 BW midrange decks, A Boros Burn deck, and, a Azorius Planar Clensing control build
2014-08-02 22:31:30	@relsqui	woo for variety
2014-08-02 22:31:35	Golem	5 distinct archetypes in the top 8 is a very good sign
2014-08-02 22:31:41	@relsqui	yeah!
2014-08-02 22:32:11	Golem	Imma be watching that whilst I code tomorrow
2014-08-02 22:36:34	Golem	Bah, and John Finkel didnt make the top 8.  Ah well, I suppose FOURTEEN pro tour top 8s is enough for now ;p

2014-08-02 23:29:57	@relsqui	honestly I just want, like, a google calendar >_>
2014-08-02 23:32:12	Golem	If I knew I would use it
2014-08-02 23:32:30	Golem	daily mtg used to be good about warning you about all the tournaments, but they are slacking recently
2014-08-02 23:32:43	@dom	I use reddit, specifically /r/mtg and /r/spikes
2014-08-02 23:32:50	Golem	and they dont cover the secondary stuff, like Star City Games and TCG opens
2014-08-02 23:33:06	@dom	/r/spikes is competitive magic reddit so they usually sticky posts about tourneys

2014-08-03 00:07:24	@relsqui	yeah I was wondering about that
2014-08-03 00:08:08	@dom	oops, thats next year
2014-08-03 00:08:25	@dom	in exactly one year, in vancouver canada...

2014-08-03 00:28:24	Golem	Deeply happy I called stoke the flames being good
2014-08-03 00:28:39	Golem	I didnt expect it to be "almost every red deck will run this" good
2014-08-03 00:28:53	Golem	but its nice that my instincts were leaning in the right direction

2014-08-03 10:43:38	Golem	Im a fan of the grull one ^_^
2014-08-03 10:45:20	Golem	Ugh, Matt Sperling did not test his u/w control match enough.  What a hidieous series of misplays.
2014-08-03 11:55:43	Golem	(to continue my live commentary of the pro tour)
2014-08-03 11:56:06	Golem	what a BRUTAL and BRILLIANT play by Ichikawa.  The most clever use of a golgari charm I have ever seen.
2014-08-03 12:02:05	@relsqui	Golem: :O what was it?
2014-08-03 12:05:39	Golem	So Ichikawa is on jund plansewalkers, whilst his opponent has g/w stompy
2014-08-03 12:06:03	Golem	Cunningham (the opponent) attacks with a 5/5 advent of the wurm token, with selesnia charm in hand
2014-08-03 12:06:18	Golem	Ichikawa has a 4/4 scavanging ooze with 3 creatures in the graveyards
2014-08-03 12:06:45	Golem	Ichikawa just drew a card we cant see, blocks the wurm with the ooze
2014-08-03 12:06:53	Golem	pumps for 1, offering to trade 5/5s
2014-08-03 12:07:16	Golem	his opponent, wanting to trample for 5 damage, attempts to exile it before damage with selesnia charm
2014-08-03 12:07:28	Golem	Ichikawa uses golgari charm to give everything -1/-1
2014-08-03 12:08:19	@relsqui	lol!
2014-08-03 12:08:20	@relsqui	cute
2014-08-03 12:08:25	Golem	The selesnia charm fizzles (because its less than 4 power now)
2014-08-03 12:08:38	Golem	and Ichikawa pumps the ooze again and gets the easy kill on the now 4/4 wurm
2014-08-03 12:08:40	Golem	wins the game
2014-08-03 12:09:56	Golem	It looks like he wont get out of this one though
2014-08-03 12:11:34	Golem	Aww thats a shame, I liked Ichikawa's deck
2014-08-03 12:11:36	Golem	ah well
2014-08-03 13:04:05	Golem	Hoooooooo, last possible turn last Rackdos's Return in the deck off the top for the win.
2014-08-03 13:04:38	Golem	Which means 4 differant decks in the quarterfinals.  That makes me happy ^^
2014-08-03 13:11:13	@relsqui	:D
2014-08-03 13:15:14	Golem	The new versions of the old guard are all represented, Black devo->B/W midrange.  U/W control->U/W with Planar Cleansing.  Jund Monsters->Jund Planeswalkers.  And a newcomer, G/W Stompy.

2014-08-03 14:36:47	aliaras	Golem: "midrange" being a mix between control/aggro?
2014-08-03 14:36:58	Golem	mm
2014-08-03 14:37:00	Golem	not exactly
2014-08-03 14:37:15	Golem	midrange is typically defined by casting threats that are in the "midrange
2014-08-03 14:37:19	Golem	of mana costs
2014-08-03 14:37:20	aliaras	ah ok.
2014-08-03 14:37:30	Golem	so stuff from 3-5/6
2014-08-03 14:37:57	Golem	There are a lot of differant forms that takes however, so its a fuzzy definition
2014-08-03 14:38:03	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-03 14:38:38	Golem	in this case, B/W midrange is using a lot of discard and creature kill spells to make way for its midrange creatures, blood baron of viscopa and Obzedat
2014-08-03 14:38:48	aliaras	nod
2014-08-03 14:39:50	Golem	The other midrange deck in the format is jund plainswalkers/monsters, which uses mana acceleration to play its midrange threats faster and uses some spells to keep its opponent from stopping them
2014-08-03 14:40:20	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-03 14:40:21	Golem	Monsters in particular relies on just playing bigger, meaner monsters faster than the other decks can deal with
2014-08-03 14:40:25	aliaras	hah
2014-08-03 14:40:26	aliaras	right.
2014-08-03 14:42:02	Golem	If you want the history of some early midrange decks, look up the deck teck on "The Rock"
2014-08-03 14:42:14	Golem	That was the first big midrange deck, as I recall
2014-08-03 14:43:03	aliaras	hmmkay

2014-08-03 14:43:43	Golem	(most convoke decks are also defined as "midrange" ^_^)
2014-08-03 14:43:59	aliaras	yeah it's somewhere between white weenies and that :)
2014-08-03 14:44:20	aliaras	my "big" guys are 3/3 and 6/6

2014-08-03 15:10:32	aliaras	yeah will do
2014-08-03 15:15:14	aliaras	hrrrr how do I edit sideboard

2014-08-03 19:42:52	@dom	believe me, I know
2014-08-03 20:25:45	Golem	bah.  Rewatching Sperling vs Floch again (burn deck vs the U/W deck) and he totaly shoulda taken game 1.  A classic case of failing to understand when you are the beatdown.
2014-08-03 20:59:38	@dom	lol floch pulled out a young pyromancer because he had no wincon

2014-08-03 21:03:57	Golem	Thats frustrating to watch
2014-08-03 21:04:06	aliaras	frustrating to play against, too :P
2014-08-03 21:04:32	Golem	probably, but he had floch dead to rights at least twice there that I could see, and he played scared instead
2014-08-03 21:04:44	Golem	you cant do that against that kind of draw-go control deck
2014-08-03 21:05:38	Golem	past the early game you have to MAKE them have the answer every turn.  Cant concerve your resources because if you give them time they will find more ways to stop you.
2014-08-03 21:07:00	Golem	theres an advanced bit of mtg strategy called "knowing who is the beatdown" thats important to pick up once you are past the basics
2014-08-03 21:07:26	Golem	I cant help but think Sperling forgot about that -_-

2014-08-04 00:49:37	@relsqui	it got pretty college in here
2014-08-04 06:40:27	aliaras	man reading backscroll in here
2014-08-04 06:40:34	aliaras	mtg would make way less sense to me if I had never been a programmer

2014-08-04 10:32:43	@relsqui	aliaras: right?!
2014-08-04 10:33:25	@relsqui	aliaras: so, true story, auras vs. non-aura enchantments used to be called "local" or "global" enchantments
2014-08-04 10:33:28	@relsqui	very briefly
2014-08-04 10:33:40	@relsqui	because to the kind of people who work on magic (and also to us) that seems intuitive >_>
2014-08-04 10:33:50	@relsqui	for "this one affects a small thing" vs "this one affects the whole board/side"
2014-08-04 10:34:01	@relsqui	and it turns out that it's not to other people XD
2014-08-04 10:38:53	aliaras	haha
2014-08-04 11:03:40	sabreman_work	damn programmers and their logic!
2014-08-04 11:04:41	aliaras	relsqui: okay so mechanically, if someone were to cast Banishing Light on Elspeth, and I had an instant that removes enchantments in hand, I could let the cast resolve, then play instant with 'enters the battlefield' effect on the stack, and I can keep my +7 elspeth?
2014-08-04 11:04:53	aliaras	(instead of bouncing her and getting a "new" +4)
2014-08-04 11:22:07	@relsqui	aliaras: removes *in hand*? no
2014-08-04 11:22:22	@relsqui	aliaras: are you somewhere you can listen to a podcast right now? ^_^
2014-08-04 11:23:10	@relsqui	because the judges of the judgecast would love to explain to you in great detail exactly what happens when you cast a spell, and why that doesn't work
2014-08-04 11:23:40	@relsqui	spoilers: enchantments do not go from your hand onto the battlefield. nor do any other cards other than lands (or, more succinctly, "any other spells")
2014-08-04 11:24:34	aliaras	relsqui: hahaha yes I am
2014-08-04 11:24:52	aliaras	relsqui: specifically, looking at
2014-08-04 11:24:55	aliaras	!card Banishing Light
2014-08-04 11:24:57	oracle	Enchantment, 2W (3)
2014-08-04 11:24:57	oracle	When Banishing Light enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Banishing Light leaves the battlefield. (That permanent returns under its owner's control.)
2014-08-04 11:25:42	aliaras	!card Ray of Dissolution
2014-08-04 11:25:42	oracle	Instant, 2W (3)
2014-08-04 11:25:42	oracle	Destroy target enchantment. You gain 3 life.
2014-08-04 11:25:51	@relsqui	oh oh oh
2014-08-04 11:25:55	@relsqui	I misparsed your question
2014-08-04 11:25:56	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-04 11:26:38	@relsqui	yeah, I think that does actually work; you need be very specific that you're casting it ray of dissolution in response to banishing light's etb trigger, though
2014-08-04 11:26:44	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-04 11:26:50	@relsqui	because that's the first time you get priority after it's cast and your last chance to pull it off
2014-08-04 11:26:55	aliaras	haha, yup
2014-08-04 11:26:59	@relsqui	also, IANAJ :P
2014-08-04 11:27:09	aliaras	lol
2014-08-04 11:27:09	@relsqui	but one of the guys who is might back me up
2014-08-04 11:27:12	aliaras	so what's this judgecast?
2014-08-04 11:27:13	@relsqui	aliaras: http://judgecast.com/?p=531
2014-08-04 11:27:51	@relsqui	I mean in general it's what it sounds like
2014-08-04 11:27:55	@relsqui	in specific that's the one I was thinking of
2014-08-04 11:27:58	@relsqui	which frankly I could stand a review of
2014-08-04 11:29:07	 *	aliaras nods
2014-08-04 11:29:45	@relsqui	really I wanna go through the comp rules again and take moar notes
2014-08-04 11:30:10	aliaras	relsqui: also I don't think that's a supported operation in forge, more's the pity
2014-08-04 11:30:21	@relsqui	responding to etb?
2014-08-04 11:30:41	aliaras	with that granularity yeah? or maybe I'm just misunderstanding the two different opportunities
2014-08-04 11:30:52	aliaras	there's "it is cast" (counterspell?) and then etb-trigger
2014-08-04 11:30:56	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-04 11:31:00	@relsqui	hmm
2014-08-04 11:31:08	@relsqui	I wanna test that but I can't think of how to set up the situation where I can
2014-08-04 11:31:09	@relsqui	in forge
2014-08-04 11:31:09	@relsqui	:P
2014-08-04 11:31:12	aliaras	relsqui: I can :P
2014-08-04 11:31:17	@relsqui	k :)
2014-08-04 11:31:21	aliaras	relsqui: it's playing Big Weenies vs. U/W control :P
2014-08-04 11:31:26	@relsqui	haha okay
2014-08-04 11:31:30	aliaras	relsqui: in which I side in 4x Ray of Dissolution
2014-08-04 11:31:41	aliaras	and just keep casting it on their turn to get my fkn guys back
2014-08-04 11:31:52	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-04 11:31:56	aliaras	[also Sunblade Elf is a wayyyyyy better card than I realized in my deck]

2014-08-04 11:32:37	aliaras	relsqui: G 1/1, +1/+1 if you control a plains, 4W to give everything +1/+1
2014-08-04 11:32:51	@relsqui	oh yeah, totally
2014-08-04 11:33:21	aliaras	had some, took them out, was looking at deck again and like "waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit"

2014-08-04 11:39:22	 *	aliaras just looked this up >__>
2014-08-04 11:40:06	aliaras	tl;dr go to settings page, find search, manage search engines, scroll to bottom-- first box is what it's called, second is what you start typing to get the prompt, third is url with %S where the text goes
2014-08-04 11:40:10	aliaras	hence ^
2014-08-04 11:40:34	@relsqui	omg every time I tab out of this box it all disappears
2014-08-04 11:40:37	@relsqui	chrome wtf

2014-08-04 15:25:21	aliaras	wait whaaaa
2014-08-04 15:25:28	aliaras	I'll have to repro
2014-08-04 15:25:32	aliaras	but I think forge did it wrong
2014-08-04 15:25:37	aliaras	Detention Sphere targeting Beast
2014-08-04 15:25:44	aliaras	I respond to etb with Ray of Dissolution
2014-08-04 15:25:50	aliaras	beasts still gone after stack resolves
2014-08-04 15:26:01	@relsqui	ray successfully let you target dsphere?
2014-08-04 15:26:16	aliaras	yes
2014-08-04 15:26:19	aliaras	but then beasts were gone
2014-08-04 15:26:27	@relsqui	oooh
2014-08-04 15:26:30	@relsqui	dsphere is one of the old-style ones
2014-08-04 15:26:33	@relsqui	nope, you're out of luck, sorry
2014-08-04 15:26:35	aliaras	fml
2014-08-04 15:26:40	aliaras	why?
2014-08-04 15:26:48	@relsqui	!card oblivion ring
2014-08-04 15:26:48	oracle	Enchantment, 2W (3)
2014-08-04 15:26:48	oracle	When Oblivion Ring enters the battlefield, exile another target nonland permanent.
2014-08-04 15:26:48	oracle	When Oblivion Ring leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control.
2014-08-04 15:26:50	@relsqui	!card banishing light
2014-08-04 15:26:50	oracle	Enchantment, 2W (3)
2014-08-04 15:26:50	oracle	When Banishing Light enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Banishing Light leaves the battlefield. (That permanent returns under its owner's control.)
2014-08-04 15:27:05	@relsqui	^ notice how the first one is two abilities and the second one is one ability?
2014-08-04 15:27:25	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-04 15:27:46	@relsqui	I'm going to use oring for example because it's simpler, but dsphere same idea
2014-08-04 15:28:03	@relsqui	opponent casts oring, targetting your beast
2014-08-04 15:28:15	@relsqui	oring etbs, its etb effect goes on the stack
2014-08-04 15:28:30	@relsqui	you get priority, you ray it
2014-08-04 15:28:36	@relsqui	its ltb effect goes on the stack
2014-08-04 15:28:45	@relsqui	you both pass priority
2014-08-04 15:28:53	@relsqui	its ltb resolves, and attempts to return the exiled card to play
2014-08-04 15:28:57	@relsqui	it cannot, because it has not yet left play
2014-08-04 15:29:04	Pash	"You pass!"
2014-08-04 15:29:19	@relsqui	actually, wait, did that wrong
2014-08-04 15:29:22	@relsqui	your ray resolves before the ltb resolves
2014-08-04 15:29:25	@relsqui	but the point stands
2014-08-04 15:29:28	@relsqui	the etb resolves *last*
2014-08-04 15:29:34	@relsqui	and exiles your beast
2014-08-04 15:29:46	Pash	actually, wait, bad reference, no one else plays The Dark Spire
2014-08-04 15:29:46	@relsqui	whereas with banishing light and the other new cards with the same effect
2014-08-04 15:29:53	@relsqui	it's a single effect with the condition "until blah"
2014-08-04 15:30:08	<--	sabreman_work (~ultra_sab@193.18.92.162) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-08-04 15:30:16	@relsqui	so banishing is cast, its etb goes on the stack, you ray it, there is no ltb trigger
2014-08-04 15:30:26	@relsqui	instead, ray resolves, and then the etb on the bottom of the stack resolves
2014-08-04 15:30:31	aliaras	fuck. my. life.
2014-08-04 15:30:36	@relsqui	its "until" condition is immediately checked and is found to have already passed
2014-08-04 15:30:41	@relsqui	so it doesn't happen.
2014-08-04 15:30:51	@relsqui	aliaras: this is *why* they changed the wording on those effects
2014-08-04 15:30:55	aliaras	relsqui: GOOD
2014-08-04 15:31:01	aliaras	also fuck jaot seriously
2014-08-04 15:31:04	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-04 15:31:21	@dom	let the blue hate flow through you
2014-08-04 15:31:23	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-04 15:31:40	aliaras	it's not blue
2014-08-04 15:31:42	aliaras	it's just jaot
2014-08-04 15:31:44	aliaras	fuck jaot.
2014-08-04 15:32:18	aliaras	[it might also be some of the rest of blue but mostly jaot is the wincon vs. this deck]
2014-08-04 15:32:21	aliaras	[often.]
2014-08-04 15:32:24	Pash	but, the blue is wonder, the blue is life
2014-08-04 15:32:35	Pash	the blue is Pash
2014-08-04 15:32:40	@relsqui	aliaras: so you're going to come play magic with us at some point while you're here right
2014-08-04 15:32:44	@relsqui	like I realize it's not your first priority
2014-08-04 15:32:45	aliaras	relsqui: yes
2014-08-04 15:32:45	@relsqui	but
2014-08-04 15:32:46	@relsqui	:P

2014-08-05 11:04:58	 *	mancat speculates on a MBD with Whip of Erebos and Nighthowler that plays some kind of mill
2014-08-05 11:05:07	@mancat	know what's better than casting gary in MBD?
2014-08-05 11:05:13	@mancat	casting the same one twice! :)
2014-08-05 11:05:57	@relsqui	^_^
2014-08-05 11:06:20	@relsqui	hey the wpn site is less broken now
2014-08-05 11:06:35	@relsqui	and I think you're right that you have to be a retailer to be officially in it

2014-08-05 11:10:21	@mancat	why the hell doesn't maggicards.info have m15 yet
2014-08-05 11:10:25	@mancat	they aren't normally this slow
2014-08-05 11:10:31	@relsqui	mancat: I've been wondering that too
2014-08-05 11:10:33	@relsqui	aliaras: how did it differ?
2014-08-05 11:10:46	@relsqui	btw, digital asset policy http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/digital-marketing-asset-policy contains no surprises
2014-08-05 11:11:07	aliaras	relsqui: printed three extra Xenagos, the Reveler, zero Slaughter Games
2014-08-05 11:11:24	@relsqui	o_O
2014-08-05 11:12:08	aliaras	despite the Slaughter Games showing up in the sideboard, they don't show up on the "print proxies" screen
2014-08-05 11:12:21	aliaras	and the three extra Xenagos are there instead
2014-08-05 11:12:54	aliaras	yeah it's...baffling
2014-08-05 11:13:32	aliaras	(ftr, there are three Xenagos in the maindeck; those are printed correctly/grouped with maindeck)
2014-08-05 11:13:59	@relsqui	there's a tickbox for "include sideboard" isn't there?
2014-08-05 11:14:41	aliaras	well, the rest of the sideboard printed correctly
2014-08-05 11:15:22	aliaras	56/60 maindeck proxies printed (-4 forests), 13/15 sideboard cards printed correctly
2014-08-05 11:16:00	@relsqui	yeah, okay, that's weird

2014-08-05 12:07:22	aliaras	what does the N mean?
2014-08-05 12:07:28	aliaras	monstrous for N turns?
2014-08-05 12:13:15	@mancat	when you activate the ability, if the creature is not monstrous
2014-08-05 12:13:26	@mancat	it becomes monstrous (permanently) and you put N +1/+1 counters on it

2014-08-05 13:21:36	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-05 13:21:41	@relsqui	mancat, Golem, other judgetypes: what's the difference between "loses defender" and "can attack as though it didn't have defender"
2014-08-05 13:21:56	aliaras	relsqui: if something affected defenders it would still hit?
2014-08-05 13:22:03	aliaras	does anything affect defenders?
2014-08-05 13:22:05	@relsqui	yeah, but I'm not aware of anything doing th -- oh, yes I am
2014-08-05 13:22:11	@relsqui	or, more often the opposite

2014-08-05 13:22:40	aliaras	hmm?

2014-08-05 13:25:44	@relsqui	but possible
2014-08-05 13:25:55	aliaras	or if it's basically all an opponent has going on
2014-08-05 13:26:04	aliaras	or you could kill it!
2014-08-05 13:26:08	aliaras	elspeth -3 would just kill it.

2014-08-05 15:35:24	aliaras	hah, nod

2014-08-05 15:36:16	@mancat	double-faced cards -_-
2014-08-05 15:36:29	aliaras	relsqui: clicking on mtgo has led to me missing entire turns, fml
2014-08-05 15:36:37	aliaras	forge too but less so
2014-08-05 15:38:16	@mancat	mtgo is like a zen training interface. less interaction is better. do only the minimum, make each click with careful consideration.
2014-08-05 15:38:25	@mancat	that's a lot of why i don't play :P
2014-08-05 15:42:04	aliaras	haha
2014-08-05 15:42:42	aliaras	i only play momir vig with a friend (at least so far) so the stakes are low :p
2014-08-05 15:43:11	@mancat	nice :D
2014-08-05 15:43:16	@mancat	i think i have an account

2014-08-05 16:25:25	@relsqui	because it did
2014-08-05 16:25:26	@relsqui	but it's okay!
2014-08-05 16:26:24	@relsqui	ha, the listserve premise today is cute. "I wrote this email two years ago so, for the first time, we could have a winner's email written from the perspective of a non-winner"
2014-08-05 16:28:36	@relsqui	"is tunnel too powerful for today's standard" lol

2014-08-05 17:42:22	@relsqui	yay!
2014-08-05 17:42:26	@relsqui	jugglervr said: "The art director of Mirage was famous for not catching things the artist weren't supposed to do such as draw angels as male." Got any more anecdotes about this individual?
2014-08-05 17:42:30	@relsqui	Sunweb was originally supposed to be unable to block white creatures until the art came back with it blocking a white creature.
2014-08-05 17:42:34	@relsqui	Waiting in the Weeds was supposed to be squirrels when it came back with cats.
2014-08-05 17:42:36	@relsqui	Goblin Scouts as supposed to be dwarves when it came back with goblins.
2014-08-05 17:42:39	@relsqui	^ sometimes I can't tell if maro is joking

2014-08-05 20:27:00	karmabot	What?
2014-08-05 20:27:03	@relsqui	karmabot: (comp rules)
2014-08-05 20:27:03	karmabot	comp rules(2): basically everything else is, though (205.3m), you can't use Redirect to make a counterspell target itself, but making it target the Redirect that's redirecting it is totally legit (114.4, 608.2k), if you manage to make an Aura enchant itself, the game will take it away and glare at you as a state-based action (303.4d), if the spell doesn't need targets you don't have to pick any (700.2c), you can't put one card in two piles (700.3a),
2014-08-05 20:27:04	karmabot	stop hitting yourself! lol (701.10c), if regeneration of a permanent is prevented, you can pay for it anyway if you want to (701.12c), you can't sacrifice someone else's creature (701.14a), templating is really important (701.15e), shuffling an empy library is still shuffling it (701.16f), you can't tap something that's tapped (701.17a)

2014-08-06 16:37:37	@dom	yeah, but he is playing standard
2014-08-06 16:37:47	@dom	I'd want to proxy a top 8 deck and play it against mancat

2014-08-06 16:48:28	@relsqui	(blah blah insert that's weird here, I still feel this way but it's getting repetitive to say it every time)
2014-08-06 16:48:46	@dom	herald of torment is really good for mbd I think
2014-08-06 16:48:49	@mancat	the dimir specter guy from RTR was goo din this deck, cuz triple black devition on 3 drop
2014-08-06 16:48:55	@mancat	but this version feels good too
2014-08-06 16:49:05	@dom	yeah I agree re specter
2014-08-06 16:49:12	@mancat	gary hits for 5-7 consistently on turn 5, which is good
2014-08-06 16:49:33	@dom	did you want the deck lists for top 8? I have the forge files
2014-08-06 16:49:36	@mancat	i'm kind of on the fence about herald of torment, but i think it's good
2014-08-06 16:49:49	@mancat	it puts a kind of pressur ein the deck that it otherwise wouldn't really have
2014-08-06 16:50:10	@dom	yeah its a shitty packrat, but it still fills the role
2014-08-06 16:50:15	@mancat	nighthowler is kind of the main source of beats, but it's not evasion
2014-08-06 16:50:26	@mancat	and nighthowler bestoed on herald, or visa versa, is really good
2014-08-06 16:50:39	@mancat	sure but not right now
2014-08-06 16:50:45	@dom	k
2014-08-06 16:50:57	@dom	me and relsqui are going to timevault soon, wanna come?

2014-08-06 16:51:54	@dom	k we'll wait for you , unless tv is closer than fab

2014-08-06 16:53:50	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-06 16:54:17	@relsqui	pick_char does what it sounds like (prompts the user to pick from a set of valid options), correct is just the int index of the correct answer
2014-08-06 16:54:34	@relsqui	and to save you a lookup, 0x61 is ascii 'a'

2014-08-07 02:39:37	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-07 16:23:29	magic	I miss when planeswalkers were immortal god-like beings with questionable, if any, morality
2014-08-07 16:24:59	magic	I heard the arguement for why they were taken off the pedestal, but have yet to see WotC actually the advantages of a more down to earth walker as they technically are
2014-08-07 17:47:16	aliaras	relsqui: either; probably hanging out with christy sat. night/sun morning fwiw.
2014-08-07 18:34:36	@relsqui	okay cool

2014-08-07 18:38:13	@relsqui	I guess if you have plans on Saturday night I have a mild preference for going Sunday, because then we can both be busy that night and hang out the following evening
2014-08-07 18:38:37	@relsqui	or at least have the potential to

2014-08-07 19:32:27	aliaras	relsqui: solution: just swing harder B)
2014-08-07 19:32:27	@dom	relsqui: no, burning anger is way too expensive
2014-08-07 19:32:35	@relsqui	granted

2014-08-07 19:35:04	aliaras	only swinging for four now-- fkn blockers-- but still
2014-08-07 19:35:37	@relsqui	the other solution for red is to kill them before they get a chance to do anything about it
2014-08-07 19:35:41	@relsqui	that's my favorite
2014-08-07 19:35:53	@relsqui	!card sulfuric vortex

2014-08-07 19:36:27	oracle	Trample (If this creature would assign enough damage to its blockers to destroy them, you may have it assign the rest of its damage to defending player or planeswalker.)
2014-08-07 19:36:27	oracle	Glacial Crasher can't attack unless there is a Mountain on the battlefield.
2014-08-07 19:36:30	aliaras	^that happened.
2014-08-07 19:36:44	 *	aliaras frenzies it from blocking
2014-08-07 19:37:45	@dom	relsqui: I can't use sulfuric vortex its not in standard
2014-08-07 19:38:01	@relsqui	I wasn't giving you deck advice :P
2014-08-07 19:38:04	@dom	im trying to play a bunch of 1 cost auras and generator servant to get out brood keeper and keep it making dragons
2014-08-07 19:38:08	@dom	shhhh
2014-08-07 19:38:16	aliaras	hrngh okay
2014-08-07 19:38:18	@dom	and then im using the enchant from m15 to make all dragons be lorded
2014-08-07 19:38:20	aliaras	so it's a forge/mtgo difference
2014-08-07 19:38:39	aliaras	mtgo: must cast all pre-combat spells in main
2014-08-07 19:38:53	aliaras	forge: it goes to pre-combat THEN declare attackers
2014-08-07 19:39:13	@dom	you can't cast pre-combat spells in begin combat?
2014-08-07 19:39:19	aliaras	not as attacker
2014-08-07 19:39:26	@dom	yeah thats true
2014-08-07 19:39:44	@dom	mtgo should give you prior during declare blockers no matter who you are
2014-08-07 19:39:54	@dom	err, unless they dont block
2014-08-07 19:39:59	@dom	then it just goes to combat damage
2014-08-07 19:39:59	aliaras	nod
2014-08-07 19:40:01	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-07 19:40:02	aliaras	they did
2014-08-07 19:40:07	aliaras	hte time i was like 'wut' on
2014-08-07 19:40:12	@relsqui	actually iirc you get priority in declare blockers even if they don't
2014-08-07 19:40:14	@relsqui	I'd have to double check
2014-08-07 19:40:17	aliaras	btw if we time out and i'm at more life
2014-08-07 19:40:19	aliaras	do i win
2014-08-07 19:40:22	@relsqui	actually no you totally do
2014-08-07 19:40:23	@relsqui	absolutely
2014-08-07 19:40:29	@relsqui	aliaras: no idea
2014-08-07 19:40:35	aliaras	about to find out
2014-08-07 19:40:44	@relsqui	I think timeouts are usually draw, aren't they?
2014-08-07 19:40:48	@relsqui	because life total is not indicative of who's winning
2014-08-07 19:40:55	aliaras	I won and I'm not sure why
2014-08-07 19:40:57	@relsqui	heh
2014-08-07 19:41:02	@relsqui	opponent scoop?
2014-08-07 19:41:12	@dom	relsqui: really? I thought you only get passed priority back after attacks if they do something
2014-08-07 19:41:31	@relsqui	dom: I swing at you with a firebreather. it goes to declare blockers. you decline to declare blockers.
2014-08-07 19:41:35	@relsqui	I still get to pump before combat damage
2014-08-07 19:41:44	@relsqui	there's no other time I could do that than in declare blockers
2014-08-07 19:42:07	@dom	yeah, I know that
2014-08-07 19:42:16	@dom	hmmmm Im thinking mtgo is bugged
2014-08-07 19:42:16	@relsqui	so I get priority in db even if you don't d any b
2014-08-07 19:42:33	@dom	because I knew all of that before, im not stupid
2014-08-07 19:42:38	@dom	I play aggro
2014-08-07 19:42:44	@dom	but mtgo just ignores that
2014-08-07 19:42:46	@dom	dgafs
2014-08-07 19:42:53	@relsqui	I'm skeptical
2014-08-07 19:43:06	@relsqui	mtgo is actually a rules standard
2014-08-07 19:43:15	@relsqui	I've never seen it so I can't comment on what you're seeing
2014-08-07 19:43:21	@relsqui	but I'm extremely skeptical it's that wrong
2014-08-07 19:43:32	@dom	I've definitely seen that, I think its a recent bug with the new overhaul
2014-08-07 19:43:37	@relsqui	hmmm
2014-08-07 19:43:38	@dom	they overhauled it for m15, you see

2014-08-08 00:43:12	@relsqui	but I think you don't realize how bad it is
2014-08-08 00:43:18	@relsqui	I just got a package in the mail and was like omg

2014-08-08 01:02:13	@relsqui	dom: okay! I fixed the ts issue I was having. we can now have either ts or mumble. got a preference?
2014-08-08 01:02:16	@relsqui	the ts is private, dunno that we care
2014-08-08 01:03:08	@dom	eh it doesn't matter to me
2014-08-08 05:00:04	aliaras	relsqui: right now a 2015 booster box is my card carrying solution and I'm about to need a better one >____>
2014-08-08 06:39:19	@dom	aliaras: fat pack box and deckboxes inside that
2014-08-08 06:39:21	@dom	so good

2014-08-08 07:31:24	aliaras	dom: so far it's cards in fat pack, sleeves in one of the deckboxes that came with it, two proxy decks just rubber banded together and shoved somewhere idk
2014-08-08 07:31:33	aliaras	my real deck in the fat pack box tho
2014-08-08 07:32:00	aliaras	this is the sum total of Magic Things that I have and I can still take it with me on a trip, so that's pretty ok
2014-08-08 07:35:40	@dom	sure
2014-08-08 07:35:59	@dom	I can fit all my rares in a fat pack box, or my decks >>
2014-08-08 07:36:10	aliaras	haha
2014-08-08 07:36:10	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-08 07:52:27	aliaras	....i'm somewhat comforted that the GIS results for [crocodile lurking] still have Lurking Crocodile at third hit even if i tell it to show me non-personalized results
2014-08-08 08:27:18	aliaras	itt: probably the most organized my cards will ever be

2014-08-08 08:40:28	@dom	mancat will give you grief about rubber banding
2014-08-08 08:40:36	@dom	it destroys the sleeves and the cards

2014-08-08 09:07:52	@relsqui	or just

2014-08-08 09:37:19	@mancat	a little bit, now that you mention it
2014-08-08 09:37:21	@mancat	it's also cheaper...

2014-08-08 09:40:49	@relsqui	on a related note, I think at this point I'm not trying to do an event in the fall for the club
2014-08-08 09:40:52	@relsqui	for a couple of reasons
2014-08-08 09:41:10	@relsqui	1) we're new and I think could use a litle more getting our feet under ourselves, logistically (and learning how to use our admin tools and shit)
2014-08-08 09:41:16	@relsqui	2) it's getting way late to plan it
2014-08-08 09:41:24	@relsqui	3) we've missed the deadline for Viking Days which would've been a brilliant time to do it
2014-08-08 09:41:31	@mancat	aw

2014-08-08 09:41:34	@mancat	well those seem like good reasons

2014-08-08 09:44:15	@dom	act of treason + fling, for one
2014-08-08 09:44:28	@mancat	that's not cheaper, that's two cards :P

2014-08-08 09:44:34	@mancat	^ that's cheaper
2014-08-08 09:44:40	@dom	sure
2014-08-08 09:44:52	@dom	but if you're playing mono red anyways
2014-08-08 09:44:56	@relsqui	it sacs but it doesn't double fling
2014-08-08 09:44:59	@dom	who cares about cards?
2014-08-08 09:45:02	@relsqui	s/double //
2014-08-08 09:45:06	@relsqui	dom: uh me a lot
2014-08-08 09:45:24	@dom	just play faithless looting and kek for value
2014-08-08 09:45:44	@relsqui	mancat: btw, I came away yesterday with the thought that we're decided for saturday GP, is that so?
2014-08-08 09:46:01	@relsqui	also they're trying to take tecotosh right now
2014-08-08 09:46:08	@dom	pfft ingress
2014-08-08 09:46:34	 *	relsqui recharges a little
2014-08-08 09:47:14	@relsqui	mancat: also also do you have a pref between ts and mumble, sorry asking all the things
2014-08-08 09:47:18	 *	relsqui afk really this time
2014-08-08 09:49:15	@mancat	not really, no
2014-08-08 09:49:23	@mancat	vent, preferably, because i know it
2014-08-08 09:49:32	@mancat	but after vent, anytyhing but skype
2014-08-08 09:49:46	@mancat	because skype is gross and awful and i don't liek haivng it installed
2014-08-08 09:57:21	@dom	it feels unfair to play this deck vs decks with no removal
2014-08-08 09:57:48	@dom	"I have 3 dragons, a 2/5 broodkeeper and a 2/2 hero. Its turn 4. Sup?"
2014-08-08 09:57:55	@mancat	lol
2014-08-08 09:58:15	@dom	oh man pilgrimming for spectra ward is so value
2014-08-08 09:58:20	@dom	you were right about how good it is
2014-08-08 09:59:07	@mancat	oho, anger of the gods
2014-08-08 09:59:12	@mancat	basically pyroclasm but better
2014-08-08 09:59:17	@dom	!card anger of the gods

2014-08-08 09:59:18	oracle	Anger of the Gods deals 3 damage to each creature. If a creature dealt damage this way would die this turn, exile it instead.
2014-08-08 09:59:24	@mancat	a card you will probably need to watch out for
2014-08-08 09:59:31	@mancat	as i think it kills like evrything you have
2014-08-08 09:59:39	@dom	yeah, at base health
2014-08-08 09:59:47	@mancat	hence immortality thing
2014-08-08 09:59:47	@dom	man that sucks >>
2014-08-08 09:59:57	@mancat	and other thing
2014-08-08 09:59:59	@dom	yeah gift of immortality is pretty good
2014-08-08 10:00:02	@dom	and spectra ward
2014-08-08 10:00:03	@mancat	spectra ward
2014-08-08 10:00:04	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:00:06	@dom	and heliod's favor
2014-08-08 10:00:08	@dom	or whatever
2014-08-08 10:00:11	@dom	the +0/+2
2014-08-08 10:00:11	@mancat	well we shall see what's up
2014-08-08 10:00:13	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:01:00	@dom	there is a lot of piece of combos in there
2014-08-08 10:01:18	@dom	the only card I dont like is heliod's pilgrim, but there isn't anything to replace its utility
2014-08-08 10:01:23	@dom	it just sucks as a 1/2
2014-08-08 10:01:26	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:01:35	@mancat	hyave you tried playing without it and seeing how much you suffer for it?
2014-08-08 10:01:40	@mancat	cuz like
2014-08-08 10:01:44	@mancat	brimaz is pretty good :P
2014-08-08 10:01:48	@dom	HAH
2014-08-08 10:01:59	@mancat	forrealz though, brimaz might be a good card for you
2014-08-08 10:02:01	@dom	brimaz + anax and cynede + dragon mantle turn 4
2014-08-08 10:02:07	@dom	yeah I can see it now
2014-08-08 10:02:25	@dom	maybe take out 2 pilgrims and replace with brimaz?
2014-08-08 10:02:31	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:02:38	@dom	because when I need the pilgrims I *need* them
2014-08-08 10:02:42	@mancat	so pilgrim is like a 2 drop, right?
2014-08-08 10:02:44	@dom	3
2014-08-08 10:02:46	@mancat	ew
2014-08-08 10:02:48	@dom	its painful
2014-08-08 10:02:53	@mancat	yeah that kinda is
2014-08-08 10:03:06	@mancat	i mean you can just look at it as a tutor that comes with a bonus dude
2014-08-08 10:03:09	@mancat	but it still kinda sucks
2014-08-08 10:03:11	@dom	yeah
2014-08-08 10:03:28	@dom	theres a fucking 6 drop sorcery that tutors like 3 enchants
2014-08-08 10:03:37	@dom	but its a 6 drop
2014-08-08 10:04:01	@mancat	yeah...
2014-08-08 10:04:12	@mancat	pilgrim being a creature is kinda good too
2014-08-08 10:04:15	@mancat	1/2 notwithstanding
2014-08-08 10:04:23	@dom	yeah
2014-08-08 10:04:26	@mancat	auras do no good if you just got board wiped and have nothing to play them on
2014-08-08 10:04:32	@dom	yeah for sure
2014-08-08 10:04:43	@mancat	if yit's like turn 7 and you're dead in the water, pilgrim into spectra ward can buy you time
2014-08-08 10:05:02	@dom	yeah, or just let me stall with swinging with an unblockable 3
2014-08-08 10:05:07	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:05:21	@dom	yeah, I definitely think its playable and its helped me alot
2014-08-08 10:05:29	@mancat	yeah i can see that
2014-08-08 10:05:31	@dom	but if it was just like 2/1 oinstead
2014-08-08 10:05:36	@mancat	right? lol
2014-08-08 10:05:53	@mancat	huh
2014-08-08 10:05:59	@mancat	the dictate cards are pretty cool
2014-08-08 10:06:04	@mancat	too bad they're 5-drops
2014-08-08 10:06:09	@dom	I thought about dropping all my 4 of auras in the deck to 3 ofs and grabing nyxborn shieldmate
2014-08-08 10:06:15	@dom	re: having an aura stick
2014-08-08 10:06:20	@mancat	i feel like there have got to be decks in which Dictate of Heliod is good
2014-08-08 10:06:39	@dom	maybe
2014-08-08 10:06:50	@dom	if there is, I don't know it >>
2014-08-08 10:06:55	@mancat	not yours i think
2014-08-08 10:07:01	@mancat	but probably a white weenie deck somewhere
2014-08-08 10:07:05	@dom	sure
2014-08-08 10:07:14	@dom	EDH angels
2014-08-08 10:07:15	@dom	:S
2014-08-08 10:07:17	@mancat	lol
2014-08-08 10:07:45	@dom	omg mancat this is the deck where heroic is good
2014-08-08 10:07:59	@dom	or, well, not *good*
2014-08-08 10:08:02	@dom	but like, beneficial
2014-08-08 10:08:04	@mancat	i was just thinking that a little while ago, lol
2014-08-08 10:08:13	@mancat	have you tried Fabled hero?
2014-08-08 10:08:23	@mancat	it might be just not qute as good as your other dudes
2014-08-08 10:08:26	@mancat	but he's pretty good
2014-08-08 10:08:29	@dom	I haven't
2014-08-08 10:08:32	@dom	im surprised I haven't
2014-08-08 10:08:36	@dom	holy shit he'd be so good
2014-08-08 10:08:56	@mancat	he's a lot cheaper than brimaz at the same mana cost
2014-08-08 10:09:00	@mancat	not sure if he's as good, but he might be
2014-08-08 10:09:11	@mancat	with flame fist he's a 5 power doublestriker, that's hard to complain about
2014-08-08 10:09:22	@mancat	but he's also squishier than brimaz, and not vigilance
2014-08-08 10:09:28	@dom	yeah
2014-08-08 10:09:35	@mancat	brimaz is defensive, which is nice
2014-08-08 10:09:41	@mancat	but then you're a pretty fast dekc, right?
2014-08-08 10:09:44	@mancat	so you may not need that
2014-08-08 10:09:48	@dom	I dont need defense
2014-08-08 10:09:59	@dom	but brimaz gives me a better way to prevent a stumble
2014-08-08 10:10:11	@mancat	yeah, it keeps mans on the field
2014-08-08 10:10:21	@mancat	i feel like it does a better job of protecting you from blowouts
2014-08-08 10:10:28	@dom	yeah I agree
2014-08-08 10:10:29	@mancat	which is a big part of why he costs so much i think
2014-08-08 10:10:47	@dom	brimaz also doesn't die to anger
2014-08-08 10:10:50	@dom	base hp
2014-08-08 10:10:51	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:11:29	@dom	brood keeper is better akroan crusader
2014-08-08 10:11:33	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:11:40	@mancat	it's also a 4-drop
2014-08-08 10:11:55	@dom	yeah, although its very rare that I don't servant it out
2014-08-08 10:11:59	@mancat	oh right
2014-08-08 10:12:00	@mancat	fair enough
2014-08-08 10:12:21	@dom	turn 2 servant turn 3 brood keeper dragon mantle is not a unheard of play
2014-08-08 10:12:27	@dom	and actually happens pretty often
2014-08-08 10:12:49	@mancat	nice
2014-08-08 10:13:41	@dom	hmmm yeah I think dropping pilgrims to 2 and then getting brimaz is the play
2014-08-08 10:14:18	@mancat	i think you might consider Labyrinth Champion as a sideboard card
2014-08-08 10:14:30	@relsqui	mancat: sorry to be repetitive, have one more queued question and need to plan for it now. saturday GP?
2014-08-08 10:14:31	@mancat	i feel like you're likely to come up on matchups where you want that removal
2014-08-08 10:14:42	@mancat	relsqui: np. yes.
2014-08-08 10:14:51	@dom	yeah I think you're right re removal
2014-08-08 10:14:54	@mancat	i'm done at 2 and it will probably take me an hour to finish up and get over there
2014-08-08 10:14:57	@relsqui	okay cool thank you
2014-08-08 10:15:01	@mancat	np
2014-08-08 10:15:29	@dom	I just don't like to put 4 drops in here
2014-08-08 10:15:34	@dom	it feels too high for my curve
2014-08-08 10:15:44	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:15:50	@mancat	i wouldn't maindeck it for sure
2014-08-08 10:15:56	@dom	for sure
2014-08-08 10:16:19	@dom	hmm I bet this deck will be pretty cheap minus brimaz
2014-08-08 10:16:44	@dom	man I'm gonna be sad if it turns out to be not so good after khans >>
2014-08-08 10:18:44	@dom	(said every brewer ever)
2014-08-08 10:19:29	@mancat	lol
2014-08-08 10:19:36	@mancat	i'd say don't buy brimaz yet
2014-08-08 10:19:41	@mancat	didn't you say he's coming down in price?
2014-08-08 10:20:15	@dom	I don't know if he is
2014-08-08 10:20:18	@mancat	i mean either way i wouldn't buy him yet, til we test the deck a little more thoroughly
2014-08-08 10:20:19	@dom	we thought he would
2014-08-08 10:20:21	@mancat	we should play some standard :D
2014-08-08 10:20:24	@dom	yeah for sure
2014-08-08 10:20:28	@dom	after bd?
2014-08-08 10:20:29	@mancat	i thought you said he was down ot like $15
2014-08-08 10:20:31	@mancat	sure
2014-08-08 10:20:41	@dom	yeah, he's been 15 for like all of theros
2014-08-08 10:21:28	@mancat	i've been seeing 20 on magiccards.info
2014-08-08 10:21:34	@dom	hmmmm
2014-08-08 10:21:41	@dom	probably just different vendors
2014-08-08 10:21:56	@dom	I mean, I have one, so it wont cost that much but yeah im not buying any pieces until later
2014-08-08 10:22:09	@dom	I mean probably not even until after khans, I wanna make sure the deck stays good
2014-08-08 10:22:36	@dom	evolving wilds got reprinted, right?
2014-08-08 10:22:48	@mancat	i'd probably watch the first tournament post-khans closely and if brimaz makes an appearance i'd buy
2014-08-08 10:22:52	@mancat	i'm not sure but i assume so
2014-08-08 10:23:01	@mancat	i'm pretty sure that's something they're trying to keep in standard
2014-08-08 10:23:25	@dom	yeah, I mean I don't want to play evolving wilds, but I need to have both red and white
2014-08-08 10:23:33	@dom	Im running battlefield forge already
2014-08-08 10:23:36	@dom	but even with that
2014-08-08 10:23:42	@mancat	not enough?
2014-08-08 10:23:46	@dom	sometimes
2014-08-08 10:23:49	@dom	like 30% of the time
2014-08-08 10:23:51	@mancat	did the RW painland not get printed?

2014-08-08 10:24:18	@dom	yeah :(
2014-08-08 10:24:27	@mancat	sacred foundry is really the card you want
2014-08-08 10:24:34	@dom	it totally is
2014-08-08 10:24:48	@mancat	i'd play the scry land before evolving wilds though
2014-08-08 10:24:51	@mancat	it's easily as good
2014-08-08 10:24:54	@mancat	evolving wilds is slow
2014-08-08 10:24:57	@dom	the ummm temple

2014-08-08 10:24:59	@mancat	yeah
2014-08-08 10:25:05	@mancat	i think the RW temple is one of the cheapest

2014-08-08 10:25:18	@mancat	the temples are mostly prefered by control decks, and RW@ is not exactly a control color
2014-08-08 10:25:23	@dom	yeah lol
2014-08-08 10:25:28	@dom	also scry helps
2014-08-08 10:25:31	@dom	honestly
2014-08-08 10:25:34	@mancat	sure
2014-08-08 10:25:52	@dom	k gonna change and then go to orientations
2014-08-08 10:25:54	@mancat	ok
2014-08-08 10:26:15	@dom	i can proxy after desk and we can play before BD?
2014-08-08 10:26:33	@mancat	sure
2014-08-08 10:27:25	@mancat	oh that enchantment tutor is only 2 enchantments for 6
2014-08-08 10:27:27	@mancat	that's bad
2014-08-08 10:27:41	@mancat	it finds crucible but i don't think that makes it good, espcially since it sounds like you're cutting crucible
2014-08-08 10:28:10	@dom	yeah its terrible

2014-08-08 20:24:25	@relsqui	ah fair enough
2014-08-08 20:24:34	@relsqui	aliaras: hello from bd :)
2014-08-08 20:47:26	aliaras	:)
2014-08-08 20:48:53	aliaras	so I was playing mtgo on the plane (using my skills at lag-dodging from irc) and had this deck: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0a7i56czyn6t7fk/Screenshot%202014-08-08%2021.10.27.png
2014-08-08 20:52:02	aliaras	was interesting to play, but I died to lagmonster
2014-08-08 20:52:11	aliaras	(two disconnects -> remote desktop issues -> welp)
2014-08-08 20:53:07	@relsqui	aw
2014-08-08 20:53:22	@relsqui	you could pull a zigdon and just rewrite the server on the plane <_< >_>
2014-08-08 20:53:29	@dom	wat?
2014-08-08 20:53:41	aliaras	haha
2014-08-08 20:53:46	aliaras	this was me remoting into workputer
2014-08-08 20:54:23	aliaras	which...didn't help the lag problem :P
2014-08-08 20:55:53	aliaras	remarkably, remote desktop is very low-power-footprint
2014-08-08 20:56:03	@dom	wat, really?
2014-08-08 20:56:05	aliaras	yeah!
2014-08-08 20:56:12	@dom	I mean, I guess lower than running mtgo on your laptop >>

2014-08-08 20:56:34	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-08 20:56:42	aliaras	it was lower than a lot of things really

2014-08-08 20:57:13	@relsqui	dom: our friend zigdon was working on an irc bot (bucket, actually!), years ago, on a plane flight
2014-08-08 20:57:16	@relsqui	he didn't have internet
2014-08-08 20:57:22	@relsqui	but he *did* have the IRC protocol spec ...
2014-08-08 20:57:30	@dom	wat
2014-08-08 20:57:41	@relsqui	well he needed a server to test on, you see
2014-08-08 20:57:49	@relsqui	so he wrote one. obviously.
2014-08-08 20:57:49	aliaras	dom: battery only started draining more hard when I started opening Chrome and gchatting in it
2014-08-08 20:57:53	aliaras	relsqui: lol.
2014-08-08 20:57:57	aliaras	relsqui: where was he going, anyways?

2014-08-10 11:10:51	aliaras	relsqui: dom mancat whoever else: heading to gp in a little bit, be there around 12 or so
2014-08-10 11:14:04	aliaras	planning to do mtg things until like 5:30
2014-08-10 11:51:36	@relsqui	aliaras: I just woke up, I'll text you :)
2014-08-10 11:51:49	@relsqui	... I don't know why I told you that here
2014-08-10 16:05:10	stormcrow	I have returned! And I come bearing a shitload of cards, ranging from zendikar to m11 to scars (I got so many new phyrexia cards back then...) to m12 to innistrad
2014-08-10 16:05:49	stormcrow	digging through all of these should be interesting...and/or paingful, because most of them probably suck
2014-08-10 16:07:03	nightfly	who did you kill?
2014-08-10 16:08:47	stormcrow	no one the statute of limitations hasn't expired on
2014-08-10 16:09:31	stormcrow	other answers to that question: my bank account, my past self
2014-08-10 16:10:45	stormcrow	I got a lot of cards before I started at PSU (read: started at the CAT, lost my Friday nights, and decided to stop with the hobby since I didn't know anyone else I could play with then)
2014-08-10 16:11:18	stormcrow	I left them in Seattle, but went up this weekend to pick them up
2014-08-10 16:11:48	stormcrow	and now they are here! taking up space on my floor...
2014-08-10 16:18:44	nightfly	neat! I tried and get my collection of cards from storage but couldn't find them. /Way/ too much stuff in too tiny of any to sift through in time
2014-08-10 16:18:56	nightfly	s/any/area/
2014-08-10 16:32:16	@dom	stormcrow: yay! cards!
2014-08-10 16:32:24	@dom	nightfly: boo! no cards!
2014-08-10 17:48:28	@relsqui	^
2014-08-10 17:48:48	@relsqui	stormcrow: pulling out all the sucky cards is nice though, then you have fewer to haul around
2014-08-10 17:49:01	@relsqui	and you can either bulk sell them or proxy on them
2014-08-10 17:49:35	@relsqui	also, unrelatedly
2014-08-10 17:49:45	@relsqui	I just pulled a Spreading Seas in a blue sleeve out of one of my deckboxes. it is definitely not mine >_>

2014-08-10 21:02:59	@relsqui	but it threw him off

2014-08-10 21:04:07	Golem	This is why I watch pro tours and GPs.  Im pretty darn good at this game, but I dont by any means see all the plays its possible to make.

2014-08-11 03:12:54	@relsqui	or something

2014-08-11 04:19:46	@relsqui	urgh this deck really wants some ramp but playing mystics feels like cheating
2014-08-11 04:19:49	@relsqui	'cause they aren't frogs >_>
2014-08-11 08:14:00	aliaras	haha
2014-08-11 08:14:04	aliaras	is your deck just "frogs"?
2014-08-11 08:15:22	aliaras	also I had weird half-dreams on the plane about mtg and d&d and cards and stuff
2014-08-11 08:15:54	aliaras	dreaming when you're half-asleep is more trippy than normal
2014-08-11 08:36:38	@relsqui	aliaras: frog tribal. you can make pretty much tribal anything with stuff like !card adaptive automaton

2014-08-11 11:25:35	@relsqui	(also, I just realized, the problem with scouring sands is that polymorphist changes base p/t, it's often modified by other effects)
2014-08-11 11:26:46	@mancat	yeash
2014-08-11 11:31:01	@relsqui	hmm. I don't recall having strong opinions about it? the decks I'm testing against it usually beat it
2014-08-11 11:31:06	@relsqui	I should trying playing it again for a refresher, it's been a whil
2014-08-11 11:31:07	@relsqui	e
2014-08-11 11:31:11	@relsqui	maybe not while I'm at work, though
2014-08-11 14:11:45	aliaras	so I think I'm going to go back over my convoke deck and try to make it superaggro
2014-08-11 14:11:51	aliaras	which will mean cutting some cards
2014-08-11 14:11:53	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-11 14:11:55	@relsqui	probably wise!
2014-08-11 14:11:58	aliaras	but I can get a lot more 2 and 3 drops that swing for 3
2014-08-11 14:12:13	aliaras	fewer guys overall (since Raise the Alarm is something getting cut, probably)
2014-08-11 14:12:25	aliaras	but sunblade elf x4, oreskos swiftclaw x4, and then the spirit whatever
2014-08-11 14:12:30	aliaras	that's a 3-drop
2014-08-11 14:12:34	@dom	aliaras: did you want me to update my deck list for my rw aurabrood deck?

2014-08-11 14:12:47	@dom	k will do sometime today, can't guarantee soon
2014-08-11 14:12:59	aliaras	'sall good
2014-08-11 14:13:08	@dom	I'm not done tweaking it yet either
2014-08-11 14:13:11	aliaras	I'll probably go back to mtgo drafting and I need to go all dragon horde on my cards I got
2014-08-11 14:13:21	@dom	I call it aurabrood, but I think im ditching brood keepers altogether
2014-08-11 14:14:07	aliaras	oh really?
2014-08-11 14:14:08	aliaras	what for?
2014-08-11 14:14:11	aliaras	they were pretty stronk
2014-08-11 14:14:33	@dom	uhh they're 4 drops, and I dont really like to see them in my hand *allthetime*
2014-08-11 14:14:43	@dom	so that means that they probably aren't right for this deck
2014-08-11 14:15:05	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-11 14:15:32	@dom	mancat made a good point that probably a bestow guy would be good so I can always have a stick to put an aura on

2014-08-11 15:44:12	aliaras	depends on how good red cards are I guess
2014-08-11 15:44:17	aliaras	it's definitely W/* aggro though

2014-08-11 15:47:08	aliaras	no triplicate spirits yet tho
2014-08-11 15:48:00	@relsqui	aliaras: hatedrafting, I am told, not usually winning strategy
2014-08-11 15:48:07	@relsqui	that one guy whining about it notwithstanding
2014-08-11 15:48:18	aliaras	lol yeah he was an asshole
2014-08-11 15:48:18	@relsqui	it *might* make other people's decks worse but it will definitely not make yours better
2014-08-11 15:48:25	aliaras	it was more hatedraft/get into
2014-08-11 15:48:29	aliaras	like, I wanted to play red
2014-08-11 15:48:31	@relsqui	oh okay
2014-08-11 15:48:33	aliaras	I just collected all these green cards
2014-08-11 15:48:33	@relsqui	yeah that's different
2014-08-11 15:48:35	aliaras	and I could swap
2014-08-11 15:48:39	aliaras	if the red was amazeballs
2014-08-11 15:49:42	aliaras	it just didn't escape my notice that if the red was amazeballs, (1) I would have it and (2) player to my right would not
2014-08-11 15:50:34	aliaras	hngh
2014-08-11 15:50:36	aliaras	shivan reef

2014-08-11 15:57:40	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-11 15:57:48	aliaras	but her not being in someone else's deck is Relevant To My Interests
2014-08-11 15:57:52	aliaras	because just fuck that

2014-08-11 15:58:07	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-08-11 15:58:30	aliaras	like srs i think that actually is a better play than picking a reasonable other card, just because planeswalkers are shitty to my deck
2014-08-11 15:58:33	aliaras	which is swinging with dudes
2014-08-11 15:58:38	aliaras	not lava axing their face or something
2014-08-11 15:58:48	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-11 15:58:55	@dom	well that liliana is not going to completely wreck your shit
2014-08-11 15:59:01	aliaras	her ult is kinda shit
2014-08-11 15:59:03	@dom	its mostly a controllier card
2014-08-11 15:59:15	@dom	I guess ults are relevant in limited...

2014-08-11 15:59:33	aliaras	why, in standard, is it the case that if you get ulted you did something wrong?

2014-08-11 15:59:45	aliaras	yeah I ult vs forge ai plenty
2014-08-11 15:59:49	aliaras	especially with elspeth

2014-08-11 16:00:02	aliaras	i will happily convoke/chump with elspeth bros
2014-08-11 16:00:31	aliaras	also mtgo's draft interface far superior to doing it irl
2014-08-11 16:00:48	aliaras	i like this whole 'see your cards laid out by cmc and color and also pile the shit ones off while waiting for someone to pass you packs' business
2014-08-11 16:00:59	@relsqui	hehe
2014-08-11 16:01:10	@dom	aliaras: yeah I love that
2014-08-11 16:01:25	@dom	"draft some shit, 'move to sideboard' kek that shit is FORGOTTEN, yo!"

2014-08-11 16:01:52	@relsqui	(on the other hand they finally implemented "skip to end of turn" which is cool
2014-08-11 16:01:54	@relsqui	)
2014-08-11 16:02:04	aliaras	it's been six. minutes. and can't you just sort while drafting cmon god

2014-08-11 16:43:11	aliaras	dis fuckin' deck
2014-08-11 17:20:03	@dom	mancat: so the cards I don't agree with being in my rw deck are: brood keeper, generator servant, brimaz and chosen by heliod
2014-08-11 17:20:19	@dom	im running 4 of keeper and servant, 1 of chosen and 2 of brimaz
2014-08-11 17:20:57	@dom	chosen by heliod gets me a card, and lets me live through bile blight
2014-08-11 17:21:11	@dom	so might be side deckable, esp against black
2014-08-11 17:21:30	@dom	but otherwise its strictly worse than dragon mantle, and dragon mantle is basically a heroic trigger
2014-08-11 17:24:05	@dom	what I propose instead for sticks are !card mogis's warhound
2014-08-11 17:24:06	oracle	Enchantment Creature — Hound 2/2, 1R (2)
2014-08-11 17:24:06	oracle	Bestow {2}{R} (If you cast this card for its bestow cost, it's an Aura spell with enchant creature. It becomes a creature again if it's not attached to a creature.)

2014-08-11 17:24:06	oracle	Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and attacks each turn if able.

2014-08-11 17:24:18	oracle	Bestow {1}{R} (If you cast this card for its bestow cost, it's an Aura spell with enchant creature. It becomes a creature again if it's not attached to a creature.)

2014-08-11 17:26:20	@dom	also !card cavalry pegasus

2014-08-11 17:27:04	@dom	well hmm if I add in the other two, I can't make them fly with cavalry pegsus
2014-08-11 17:28:13	@dom	also maybe hushwing gryff vs mono black devotion

2014-08-11 17:49:39	aliaras	which is better?
2014-08-11 17:49:48	@relsqui	heat ray, probably
2014-08-11 17:50:01	@relsqui	the deck that wants a cheap way to burn for four doesn't run a lot of creatures
2014-08-11 17:50:07	@relsqui	the deck that runs a lot of creatures wants to swing with them
2014-08-11 17:50:22	@relsqui	I say this as someone running both decks, lol
2014-08-11 17:50:33	@relsqui	well, and mostly parroting mancat
2014-08-11 17:50:37	@relsqui	'cause I trust his judgment
2014-08-11 17:50:39	@relsqui	but some of both
2014-08-11 17:51:51	aliaras	cool, that's what I took :)
2014-08-11 17:52:04	aliaras	on similar logic
2014-08-11 17:52:19	aliaras	mostly mine was "heat ray is really flexible, if all I really really really need is to kill a Sungrace Pegasus, I can do that for 3"
2014-08-11 17:52:25	aliaras	but heyyyyy Stoke the Flames came back around lol
2014-08-11 17:52:33	 *	relsqui nods

2014-08-11 18:04:35	@relsqui	there was some serious bullshit to be done there

2014-08-11 18:06:46	@relsqui	I can overload all kinds of operators
2014-08-11 18:06:51	aliaras	ahhhhhhh
2014-08-11 18:06:55	@relsqui	scope resolution (this::one) is not one of them
2014-08-11 18:06:58	@relsqui	which seems legit honestly >_>
2014-08-11 18:07:12	@relsqui	awwww, neither is the ternary operator
2014-08-11 18:09:55	aliaras	nooooooo i think i am facing another afk person on mtgo :(

2014-08-11 18:12:39	@relsqui	but I just couldn't, after GP
2014-08-11 18:12:48	aliaras	I figure I usually only get commons at a rate of like
2014-08-11 18:12:50	aliaras	max 50/time
2014-08-11 18:14:27	aliaras	convoke combat tricks: :333333

2014-08-11 18:50:21	aliaras	well so that's why doing it for this weekend is worth it right
2014-08-11 18:50:34	aliaras	except for the stacks I'm not gonna touch which are already separate
2014-08-11 18:56:56	aliaras	ok so pretty sure this opponent ketp an all-lands hand
2014-08-11 18:57:06	aliaras	and I kept a very aggro hand
2014-08-12 00:00:22	Golem	All right, finnaly time for bed.  I shal leave you with the mtg puzzler of the night.  If you have !card Zur the Enchanter
2014-08-12 00:00:24	oracle	Legendary Creature — Human Wizard 1/4, 1WUB (4)
2014-08-12 00:00:24	oracle	Flying
2014-08-12 00:00:24	oracle	Whenever Zur the Enchanter attacks, you may search your library for an enchantment card with converted mana cost 3 or less and put it onto the battlefield. If you do, shuffle your library.
2014-08-12 00:00:56	Golem	, and you attack, fetching a pacifism.  Your opponent's only creature is a !card Slippery Boggle
2014-08-12 00:00:56	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-08-12 00:01:09	Golem	(or other relevant hexproof creature)
2014-08-12 00:01:16	Golem	what happens?
2014-08-12 00:01:40	Golem	!card Slippery Bogle
2014-08-12 00:01:41	oracle	Creature — Beast 1/1, {G/U} (1)

2014-08-12 00:10:34	@relsqui	hmmm
2014-08-12 00:10:42	@relsqui	I can see it going one of two ways
2014-08-12 00:10:59	@relsqui	I *think* the right way is you're not casting it, you're just putting it onto the field, so strictly speaking it doesn't target and you can put it on the bogle
2014-08-12 00:11:12	@relsqui	the other way is the only legal target is your own guy so it has to go on your own guy
2014-08-12 00:11:19	@relsqui	but I think the first one is true
2014-08-12 00:11:21	 *	relsqui looks for rulings
2014-08-12 00:11:40	@relsqui	> 7/15/2006: If you use Zur the Enchanter's triggered ability to search for an Aura, it will be put onto the battlefield attached to an appropriate permanent. It doesn't target that permanent.
2014-08-12 00:11:45	@relsqui	^_^
2014-08-12 00:11:50	Golem	dingdingding
2014-08-12 00:11:52	Golem	we have a winner
2014-08-12 00:13:02	@relsqui	:D
2014-08-12 00:13:06	@relsqui	I'm getting better at this game!
2014-08-12 00:13:31	Golem	This means you can also attach it to a creature with pro white!
2014-08-12 00:13:35	Golem	It will fall off immediately
2014-08-12 00:13:35	@relsqui	yes!
2014-08-12 00:13:38	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-12 00:13:40	Golem	but you can do it!
2014-08-12 00:13:41	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-12 00:13:43	@relsqui	huh
2014-08-12 00:13:45	@relsqui	you could, like
2014-08-12 00:13:46	@relsqui	heroic it
2014-08-12 00:13:54	Golem	indeed
2014-08-12 00:13:56	@relsqui	you could put it on a chroma warded brood master and make a dragon!
2014-08-12 00:14:23	Golem	And then have a pacified brood master
2014-08-12 00:14:33	Golem	because chroma ward is silly like that
2014-08-12 00:15:41	@relsqui	oh, right, weird. it doesn't remove them it just prevents them from being targeted
2014-08-12 00:15:48	@relsqui	that was a bad example, lol
2014-08-12 00:24:27	Golem	;p

2014-08-12 12:55:18	@relsqui	although in this matchup what it's doing is drawing edicts

2014-08-12 13:38:50	@dom	not a warning
2014-08-12 13:39:03	aliaras	so best joke ever when i was freaking out about tornado warning
2014-08-12 13:39:07	aliaras	was from my partner Shrdlu
2014-08-12 13:39:19	aliaras	"eh, it's nbd, it's a tornado warning. If it were a tornado *error* now..."
2014-08-12 13:39:29	@dom	kek

2014-08-12 13:40:56	@relsqui	dom: oh is it? might've misheard. or possibly the few miles between us is relevant
2014-08-12 13:41:17	@dom	its a watch for most of northern oregon according to weather
2014-08-12 13:41:33	@dom	err, google public alerts I mean

2014-08-12 13:42:15	@relsqui	ah
2014-08-12 13:43:41	@relsqui	oh it looks like there's both
2014-08-12 13:43:51	@relsqui	a broader warning and a watch in clackamas and se multnomah counties
2014-08-12 13:43:53	@relsqui	the second one is what we saw
2014-08-12 13:44:02	@relsqui	but the map area google shows is pretty far from us
2014-08-12 13:44:17	@relsqui	"At 1:36 pm PDT, Doppler radar indicated a severe thunderstorm capable of producing quarter size hail and damaging winds in excess of 60 mph."
2014-08-12 13:44:47	@relsqui	if it's moving this way I feel like I should probably go to where I want to be when it hits, though.
2014-08-12 13:44:56	aliaras	in bed? *g*
2014-08-12 13:45:06	@relsqui	no, on campus

2014-08-12 13:51:01	@dom	kek
2014-08-12 13:51:44	@dom	if it turns out to be an emp and we have to kill to survive

2014-08-12 17:50:14	@mancat	it's kind of a cool setting IMO
2014-08-12 17:50:38	@mancat	not a major one in terms of impact on magic multiverse, but i thought it was pretty well done
2014-08-12 17:50:49	@mancat	of course i'm biased

2014-08-12 17:51:25	@mancat	it's also kinda classic tabletop RPG feeling
2014-08-12 17:51:26	@relsqui	so I tend to agree with them :P
2014-08-12 17:51:39	@mancat	it starts out like classic D&D and ends up like Call of Cthulhu
2014-08-12 17:51:40	aliaras	haha
2014-08-12 17:51:47	@relsqui	nice
2014-08-12 17:52:15	@relsqui	"like C++, classes in Java can have member functions (called methods) ..." wait, are they not called methods in C++?
2014-08-12 17:52:19	@relsqui	I have probably confused a lot of people
2014-08-12 17:52:19	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-12 17:52:29	@mancat	relsqui: lol yeah
2014-08-12 17:52:41	@mancat	i've started calling them methods this week too cuz suddenly java
2014-08-12 17:53:07	@mancat	all functions are methods and all modules are functions and i don't know what is going on any more

2014-08-15 01:27:24	@mancat	also yes, your Anger of the Gods question does work the way you want it to
2014-08-15 01:48:56	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-15 01:49:12	@relsqui	was p. confident but dom was not; wanted a second opinion so he didn't have to trust his opponent, heh
2014-08-15 13:47:42	@dom	Im tempted to make a hexproof deck just to say fuck you to emoval
2014-08-15 13:47:43	@dom	removal
2014-08-15 13:49:32	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-15 13:51:40	aliaras	hahaha
2014-08-15 13:53:44	@dom	there isn't a ton of hexproof >>
2014-08-15 13:53:57	@dom	I can do like fleecemane lion and the reach guy in green
2014-08-15 13:54:02	@dom	and then like ranger's guile

2014-08-15 14:02:06	aliaras	okay so I've been tinkering with simulated drafts
2014-08-15 14:02:10	aliaras	and made this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r84rc44rj64tzxo/blue-and-goblins.png
2014-08-15 14:02:12	aliaras	v. proud of it.
2014-08-15 14:03:53	@dom	:P
2014-08-15 14:04:03	@dom	I like using blue for void snare and dissipation
2014-08-15 14:04:13	@dom	not so much creatures
2014-08-15 14:05:16	@dom	I like aeronaut tinkerer too
2014-08-15 14:05:25	@dom	can usually grab an artifact and he has good pt
2014-08-15 14:08:23	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-15 14:08:34	aliaras	yeah the pathmage is some evasion stuff
2014-08-15 14:08:38	aliaras	the nimbus flies
2014-08-15 14:08:44	aliaras	the glacial crasher... "hey it's a creature"
2014-08-15 14:08:49	@dom	I dont like nimbus because its 5 for a flying 3/3
2014-08-15 14:08:53	aliaras	not super happy about the UU but it works
2014-08-15 14:08:59	@dom	yeah flying is good but im not paying 2 more for it
2014-08-15 14:09:04	aliaras	the real point of the deck is "goblins" and "more goblins"
2014-08-15 14:09:08	@dom	sure
2014-08-15 14:09:13	aliaras	ideally either Goblin Rabblemaster or Obelisk of Urd or both
2014-08-15 14:09:19	@dom	yeah
2014-08-15 14:09:24	@dom	I like borderland marauder too
2014-08-15 14:09:27	@dom	for fast red
2014-08-15 14:09:30	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-15 14:09:32	aliaras	didn't see any
2014-08-15 14:09:36	aliaras	but borderland marauder has won me soem games
2014-08-15 14:09:38	aliaras	some*
2014-08-15 14:10:09	@dom	I love marauder + hammerhand
2014-08-15 14:10:12	@dom	or ferno fist
2014-08-15 14:12:52	aliaras	inferno fist is awesome
2014-08-15 14:12:55	aliaras	hammerhand i'm sorta so/so on
2014-08-15 14:12:58	aliaras	like, it's a fine card
2014-08-15 14:13:02	aliaras	but it's not an amazeballs card
2014-08-15 14:14:47	@dom	its for 1 red
2014-08-15 14:15:23	@dom	I like it because it forces your opponent to have an answer 1 turn before they usually have to
2014-08-15 14:20:31	aliaras	nodnod

2014-08-15 20:00:43	oracle	Primordial Ooze attacks each turn if able.
2014-08-15 20:00:43	oracle	At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on Primordial Ooze. Then you may pay {X}, where X is the number of +1/+1 counters on it. If you don't, tap Primordial Ooze and it deals X damage to you.
2014-08-15 20:20:05	Corax	That was an amusing card.
2014-08-15 20:22:37	 *	relsqui oozes at corax
2014-08-15 20:24:57	aliaras	iiiiinteresting
2014-08-15 20:41:53	aliaras	so like
2014-08-15 20:41:54	aliaras	in draft
2014-08-15 20:42:05	aliaras	is "always draft mythics" a decent rule, even if you're hatedrafting half the time
2014-08-15 20:42:29	aliaras	well, at least planeswalkers
2014-08-15 20:42:38	aliaras	(thinking about e.g. p2p1)
2014-08-15 20:43:42	@dom	depends on the mythic
2014-08-15 20:43:47	@dom	some are pretty dang good
2014-08-15 20:43:55	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-15 20:43:58	@dom	but think about running both, unless you're deep in a color
2014-08-15 20:44:04	aliaras	was kinda deep already
2014-08-15 20:44:09	@dom	like, pack 2 first pick is not too late to switch
2014-08-15 20:44:23	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-15 20:44:25	aliaras	yeah, maybe.
2014-08-15 20:44:45	aliaras	I didn't, but it's worth thinking about
2014-08-15 20:44:48	@dom	sure
2014-08-15 20:44:53	aliaras	I was about equally deep in red/green which looked pretty fkn open
2014-08-15 20:44:56	aliaras	although looking more
2014-08-15 20:44:58	aliaras	it's mostly green
2014-08-15 20:44:59	@dom	if you're keeping the cards, aka normal drafting
2014-08-15 20:45:12	@dom	I would honestly suggest to keep most mythics >>
2014-08-15 20:45:22	aliaras	yeah it is >_>
2014-08-15 20:45:24	@dom	unless its like an actual tourney
2014-08-15 20:45:25	aliaras	well normal mtgo

2014-08-15 20:45:58	aliaras	which would have been great
2014-08-15 20:46:03	aliaras	if i could realistically go blue at this point :P
2014-08-15 20:46:21	aliaras	and you can't splash for plainswalkers :P

2014-08-16 13:52:32	oracle	{U}, {T}: Each player reveals the top card of his or her library. You may put the revealed cards into their owners' graveyards. If you don't, each player draws a card.
2014-08-16 13:52:42	@relsqui	just as a way to draw into the combo faster
2014-08-16 14:07:05	@relsqui	also it draws edicts but that's only because the AI is dumb
2014-08-16 14:13:41	@relsqui	hm, perhaps magma jet should be in side
2014-08-16 14:34:01	@relsqui	or at least a candidate for siding out
2014-08-16 14:40:57	@relsqui	aw, man. http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/13483_Official_Planar_Chaos_Preview_Timbermare.html
2014-08-16 15:09:11	@relsqui	hey, wth
2014-08-16 15:09:30	@relsqui	does heroic go off even if the spell is countered?
2014-08-16 15:09:34	@relsqui	I guess it's ... cast but doesn't resolve
2014-08-16 15:09:37	@relsqui	hrmph
2014-08-16 15:52:46	@dom	I dont think heroic goes off if the spell is countered
2014-08-16 15:52:53	@dom	because the aura never enters the field
2014-08-16 16:05:22	@relsqui	heroic isn't based on auras, though
2014-08-16 16:05:30	@relsqui	!card hero of leina tower

2014-08-16 22:01:10	Golem	Puts out purpheros and some goblin rabblmasters
2014-08-16 22:01:33	Golem	im thinking, oh, thats cute.  But I have a bunch of 5/5s and 7/7s out, ill just race
2014-08-16 22:01:58	Golem	Monstrous Polukranos for like 12, wipe his board.  Attack him.

2014-08-16 22:04:47	@relsqui	niiiice
2014-08-16 22:05:33	Golem	in my defense, if I had played smart and used some of that extra mana to play the nylea in my hand i would have still won ><.
2014-08-16 22:07:43	Golem	I now have the deck list, and it is called "Bee Shenanigans"
2014-08-16 22:07:50	Golem	I think I am in love
2014-08-16 22:08:14	Golem	All though I think I will rename it slightly to "NOT THE BEES!"
2014-08-16 22:21:53	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-16 22:22:12	@relsqui	chord into bees is pretty great
2014-08-16 22:43:53	Golem	....this deck might actually be awesome
2014-08-16 22:44:06	Golem	I just took down a deck like the one that won the PT
2014-08-16 22:44:40	@dom	nice
2014-08-16 22:44:49	@dom	that deck greatly depends on the pilot though
2014-08-16 22:45:01	Golem	yar
2014-08-16 22:45:25	Golem	NTBs actually has a lot of fast walkers though, so it turns out its not as lopsided a match as I thought

2014-08-17 18:26:08	aliaras	testing starts now.
2014-08-17 18:26:18	aliaras	maindeck: things I actually have. Maybeboard: maybe?
2014-08-17 18:35:09	aliaras	feedback very welcome ( dom, relsqui)
2014-08-17 18:42:34	@dom	if you're doing red, I dont like burning anger or brood keeper, though I've been wrong before
2014-08-17 18:43:21	@dom	check out rabblemaster red decks online for more good cards
2014-08-17 18:43:41	@dom	I mean, they'll use rtr cards and rotating ones, but they also have good ones like firedrinker satyr
2014-08-17 18:45:27	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-17 18:45:41	aliaras	hmmmm. why not like either of those?
2014-08-17 18:45:46	@dom	too high cost
2014-08-17 18:45:49	aliaras	I like burning anger because it's basically 5 mana/shocks forever
2014-08-17 18:45:58	@dom	yeah, if your creatures stay alive
2014-08-17 18:46:08	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-17 18:46:26	@dom	burning anger feels a lot better in limited
2014-08-17 18:46:59	@dom	because theres fewer boardwipes
2014-08-17 18:47:10	@dom	but you might run into anger of the gods / other stuff in constructed
2014-08-17 18:47:34	@dom	and then you wasted 5 mana on a card that could have been 2 or 3 haste creatures that burn with purphuros anyways
2014-08-17 18:48:04	@dom	I think theres a super sweet red deck hidden in purphuros / rabblemaster / raise the alarm combo
2014-08-17 18:48:10	@dom	with fast red creatures
2014-08-17 18:48:40	aliaras	hmmmmmm

2014-08-17 18:48:52	aliaras	yeah my maybeboard has 'maybe i'll splash white' in it
2014-08-17 18:50:10	aliaras	I need a stompy type deck to play this against
2014-08-17 18:50:12	aliaras	a few times
2014-08-17 18:50:15	aliaras	and see if I wreck myself

2014-08-17 18:55:49	@dom	I like forge devils, though you may not
2014-08-17 18:55:57	@dom	firedrinker satyr is super good, imo

2014-08-17 19:01:15	@dom	you don't have to use the active ability, but its there and that gives you options
2014-08-17 19:01:21	@mancat	yeah for sure
2014-08-17 19:01:27	@mancat	reach is important for burn, and that's good reach
2014-08-17 19:01:27	@dom	it also allows you to trade up if they drop a fatty on turn 4 and you're out of gas
2014-08-17 19:02:00	aliaras	'reach'?
2014-08-17 19:02:09	aliaras	also it sounds like it's dealing damage to *you*
2014-08-17 19:02:17	aliaras	not reflecting it back at the player who did the damage?
2014-08-17 19:02:21	aliaras	or am I misunderstanding
2014-08-17 19:02:58	@mancat	it does both, cuz you only use it when it's attacking or blocking, generally
2014-08-17 19:03:10	@mancat	reach is like...
2014-08-17 19:03:27	@mancat	your ability to pull through and cover the last mile
2014-08-17 19:03:50	@mancat	red kinda has that thing where you're racing both against your opponent's turn counter, and against your own dwindling hand
2014-08-17 19:04:37	@mancat	so reach is what you need when you're like "man it's turn 6, i've lost board advantage, i'm out of cards and my opponent is at 5 life... if only i could top-deck a laval axe"
2014-08-17 19:05:14	aliaras	right.
2014-08-17 19:05:27	@mancat	and, incidentally, why lava axe is not a terrible card :P
2014-08-17 19:05:32	aliaras	haha
2014-08-17 19:05:33	aliaras	sure
2014-08-17 19:05:39	aliaras	could sub that for burning anger
2014-08-17 19:05:51	aliaras	although damn does it feel good to turn the brood guy sideways and hit for two
2014-08-17 19:05:54	aliaras	all the time
2014-08-17 19:06:00	@dom	I think theres something probably better than lava axe >>
2014-08-17 19:06:29	@mancat	that's often true, it's just kind of a statement about the importance of reach
2014-08-17 19:06:53	@mancat	firedrinker satyr is good reach, lets you swing for like 5 with him when you're out of cards in hand
2014-08-17 19:07:17	@dom	yah
2014-08-17 19:07:47	@dom	I want to say put magma jet in place of the other 4 of, but I don't think its the answer for all red decks
2014-08-17 19:07:55	@dom	scry is good, but I think you want creatures
2014-08-17 19:07:59	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-17 19:08:08	aliaras	I think I also need a replacement for frenzied goblin for control decks
2014-08-17 19:08:20	aliaras	he's in there because 'goblin' and 1-drop and decent deal for creature decks
2014-08-17 19:08:44	@dom	frenzied goblin is good
2014-08-17 19:09:10	@dom	imo, bump goblin rabblemaster and roughrider to 3 ofs and purphuros to 3 of as well

2014-08-17 21:57:51	@relsqui	> The concept behind ASA is simple: infinite life, infinite mana, shared library and graveyard. If you can do something, you have to do it as soon as you can. If a spell or ability can target multiple things, you have to do as much as possible. Any abilities have to be activated as soon as possible after the permanent comes under your control, but only once (and exactly once) per turn cycle. If you miss an ability, don't play a spell when you could ...
2014-08-17 21:57:57	@relsqui	... or break a game rule, you lose.
2014-08-17 21:58:01	@relsqui	"Activate the third ability of Mist Dragon, hold priority, activate the second ability of Mist Dragon, hold priority, activate the first ability of Mist Dragon.

2014-08-17 21:59:26	@relsqui	> It's also a very counter-intuitive format as the almost uniformly correct play is to avoid drawing cards, avoid having permanents and avoid having cards in your hand.

2014-08-17 22:10:43	@relsqui	when you don't do something you could have done as soon as you could have done it, you lose

2014-08-17 22:10:55	@relsqui	Q: In As Soon As, I played Dread Statuary and activated its second ability, then its first ability in response. My opponent says I lose. Why?
2014-08-17 22:10:58	@relsqui	!card dread statuary
2014-08-17 22:10:59	oracle	Land
2014-08-17 22:10:59	oracle	{T}: Add {1} to your mana pool.
2014-08-17 22:10:59	oracle	{4}: Dread Statuary becomes a 4/2 Golem artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.
2014-08-17 22:11:05	@relsqui	A: Because you had an opportunity to activate the first ability, and didn't. The Statuary's second ability requires a mana payment as part of its cost, so the game gives you an opportunity to activate mana abilities during the process of activating it. You needed to activate the first ability at that time in order to avoid losing.
2014-08-17 22:12:06	@relsqui	this sounds completely ridiculous and I want to try it.
2014-08-17 22:15:36	@relsqui	here's a good one I got wrong today

My untapped lands are two Swamps and one Plains, and I have Tragic Slip and Path to Exile in hand. Can I cast Altar's Reap in such a way so that, whichever color the returning Iona names, I have the mana to deal with it immediately?
2014-08-17 22:15:57	@relsqui	the fact that they bothered answering it at all means the answer is yes, of course

2014-08-17 23:19:40	@relsqui	so I'm pretty satisfied by that :)
2014-08-17 23:19:45	 *	relsqui afk
2014-08-17 23:53:24	@mancat	nice! grats!
2014-08-18 01:43:45	@relsqui	thanks <3
2014-08-18 01:43:52	@relsqui	took me a couple of tries
2014-08-18 01:43:55	@relsqui	but I am proud of myself
2014-08-18 19:01:41	aliaras	hey relsqui what happens if I ensoul an ensouled artifact
2014-08-18 19:01:54	@relsqui	I can answer that but I bet you can figure it out
2014-08-18 19:02:02	@relsqui	if you just read the card very literally
2014-08-18 19:02:36	@relsqui	(but if you don't wanna do that thing I'll just tell you)
2014-08-18 19:02:38	 *	relsqui usual error
2014-08-18 19:04:34	aliaras	relsqui: tried reading card ;-)
2014-08-18 19:04:53	@relsqui	basically, your 5/5 artifact creature becomes a 5/5 artifact creature
2014-08-18 19:05:08	@relsqui	so unless something else happens in between which also affects one or more of those properties, nothing changes
2014-08-18 19:05:10	aliaras	got it.
2014-08-18 19:05:23	@relsqui	note that something which gives, say, +1/+1 does not count for that!
2014-08-18 19:05:27	@relsqui	so if you ensoul it, it becomes a 5/5
2014-08-18 19:05:34	@relsqui	and then an effect gives it +1/+1 'til end of turn or something
2014-08-18 19:05:37	@relsqui	and you ensoul it again
2014-08-18 19:05:39	@relsqui	it's still 6/6
2014-08-18 19:05:42	@relsqui	the 5/5 doesn't override the bonus
2014-08-18 19:06:43	aliaras	likewise
2014-08-18 19:06:45	aliaras	Peel from Reality
2014-08-18 19:06:49	aliaras	fizzles if you have no creatures?
2014-08-18 19:07:47	aliaras	ffffffffffffff
2014-08-18 19:07:59	@relsqui	it doesn't get as far as fizzling; you can't legally cast it if you don't have a creature at that time
2014-08-18 19:08:00	aliaras	did not quite have enough mana up to peel in response to a lightning strike
2014-08-18 19:08:03	aliaras	ah ok
2014-08-18 19:08:18	@relsqui	if you cast it first, and someone destroys your creature in response
2014-08-18 19:08:22	@relsqui	*then* it fizzles
2014-08-18 19:08:37	aliaras	ahhhh ok
2014-08-18 19:08:54	aliaras	see above re missing a chance to peel in response to a bolt >_>

2014-08-18 19:29:15	aliaras	pretty bad deck
2014-08-18 19:29:16	aliaras	it's just bad
2014-08-18 19:29:25	@relsqui	mm. how so?
2014-08-18 19:29:27	aliaras	I was like, blue and white and control?
2014-08-18 19:29:30	aliaras	but it's missing enough creatures
2014-08-18 19:29:32	@relsqui	is def. a thing!
2014-08-18 19:29:33	@relsqui	ahh, yeah
2014-08-18 19:29:38	aliaras	just got licked by a kinda mediocre white/red deck
2014-08-18 19:29:54	aliaras	and like I could kinda tell that white was getting drafted
2014-08-18 19:29:58	aliaras	(trying to get better at that)
2014-08-18 19:30:53	aliaras	okay so i've hit the learning plateau of like, learned a lot, and how much i've learned about being good has outstripped my ability to do it p_q

2014-08-18 19:31:58	aliaras	have done it in forge, have done it on a website
2014-08-18 19:32:07	aliaras	atm doing it on mtgo vs humans but that's a time-consuming process

2014-08-18 19:32:47	nightfly	Do y'all use a thing to print your proxies or do you do it manually?

2014-08-18 19:45:28	aliaras	I'm not sure what it stands for
2014-08-18 19:45:42	aliaras	I just think of it as "The thingie that makes sure noobs play noobs"
2014-08-18 19:47:01	@relsqui	oh
2014-08-18 19:47:05	@relsqui	it's not ELO, it's Elo
2014-08-18 19:47:06	@relsqui	it's a name
2014-08-18 19:47:41	aliaras	oh!
2014-08-18 19:48:11	@relsqui	and strictly speaking it doesn't ensure you play other noobs, it just ensures you get more credit when you play less nooby people than you
2014-08-18 19:48:58	@relsqui	The DCI (formerly Duelists' Convocation International) used Elo ratings for tournaments of Magic: The Gathering and other Wizards of the Coast games. However, the DCI abandoned this system in 2012 in favour of a new cumulative system of "Planeswalker Points", chiefly because of the above-noted concern that Elo encourages highly rated players to avoid playing to "protect their rating".[22][23]
2014-08-18 19:58:42	aliaras	oh cool
2014-08-18 19:58:57	aliaras	also yesssssss.

2014-08-19 14:59:57	@relsqui	looking at the mana symbols in the deck it seems like I need way less white than everything else, but I forgot that I reuse the same ephara's enlightenment a lot
2014-08-19 15:02:06	@relsqui	the problem is I want to drop some red for white, but I don't want to cut mountains because of chained, and everything else is in duals
2014-08-19 15:02:26	@relsqui	I think this can be done but it takes some juggling
2014-08-19 15:02:50	@relsqui	(and I don't want to reduce total number of duals because those are handy)

2014-08-22 16:33:11	@relsqui	yeah :/
2014-08-22 16:33:29	aliaras	it's mostly I wouldn't expect that knowing what I know of mtg
2014-08-22 16:33:29	@relsqui	so I wouldn't suggest this to any new player who didn't *also* read reactor tech specs for fun, but ... you could actually just read the comprehensive rules >_>
2014-08-22 16:33:34	aliaras	haha
2014-08-22 16:33:37	aliaras	I didn't for *fun* :P

2014-08-22 17:35:35	aliaras	a few different ways to win but nothing amazeballs
2014-08-22 17:36:19	@dom	sure
2014-08-22 17:47:21	aliaras	loooool mirror matchup first game
2014-08-22 17:55:16	aliaras	oh good my opponent has soul of theros
2014-08-22 18:18:41	@mancat	>_>
2014-08-22 18:22:25	aliaras	oh actually this channel might be interested
2014-08-22 18:22:30	@relsqui	sup?
2014-08-22 18:22:31	aliaras	I'm trying to decode mtgo's game logs
2014-08-22 18:22:37	@relsqui	oh yeah I saw this in otherchannel
2014-08-22 18:22:41	@relsqui	I don't know if anyone in here plays mtgo though
2014-08-22 18:22:58	aliaras	no but the combo of 'magic' and 'interested in puzzles involving hex codes' is possible >_>
2014-08-22 18:23:08	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-22 18:23:09	@relsqui	true
2014-08-22 18:23:16	aliaras	game logs exhibit a: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/14e64c4fe1993dcf43fa#file-gistfile1-txt
2014-08-22 18:23:47	@relsqui	(we're in braindump, though, so maybe not super active)
2014-08-22 18:23:57	aliaras	so far I have figured out that it is [xxxx] [two bytes related to game] [d1 08] [00] [one byte related to action/player]
2014-08-22 18:24:09	aliaras	shrdlu thinks the last two are a 16-bit integer
2014-08-22 18:24:29	aliaras	in which case it might be [xx] [xx] [yy] [d1 08] [00zz]
2014-08-22 18:24:34	aliaras	er, [00 z]
2014-08-22 18:24:42	aliaras	~consistency~
2014-08-22 18:25:52	aliaras	hmmmm if I just want the logs I can just regex for them
2014-08-22 18:26:18	aliaras	won't get me hand info still, but I don't think it's hiding in this hex
2014-08-22 21:15:34	@relsqui	Golem: whta are you playing?
2014-08-22 21:15:54	@dom	tell me what you see, and I can probably ID it
2014-08-22 21:16:19	aliaras	hmm?
2014-08-22 21:16:23	@relsqui	not enough to be useful. isomorphic. rpgish?
2014-08-22 21:16:27	@relsqui	aliaras: we're in braindump, I'm screencreeping :P
2014-08-22 21:16:31	aliaras	haha :P
2014-08-22 21:16:35	aliaras	mannnnnnnnnnnnnnn
2014-08-22 21:16:42	@dom	relsqui: minimap in bottom right?
2014-08-22 21:16:51	@relsqui	uh, not right now but he's in a menu
2014-08-22 21:16:57	@dom	but usually?
2014-08-22 21:17:03	@relsqui	doesn't look like
2014-08-22 21:17:10	@dom	any minimap?
2014-08-22 21:17:10	@relsqui	there's a side menu thing that pulls out when he mouses over it
2014-08-22 21:17:14	@relsqui	which might have a map in it?
2014-08-22 21:17:18	aliaras	Eric is moving desks which means I will no longer have random magic conversations via mutual screencreeping >_>
2014-08-22 21:17:23	@relsqui	haha aw
2014-08-22 21:17:32	@relsqui	you could just leave a hangout up :P
2014-08-22 21:17:37	aliaras	it's true :p
2014-08-22 21:17:53	@dom	hmmm he might be playing HoMMM (one of em)
2014-08-22 21:17:55	@relsqui	oooog my tummy hurts as predicted
2014-08-22 21:17:55	aliaras	I am just a little sad about both the loss of magic conversations and mentoring
2014-08-22 21:17:56	@dom	or something else
2014-08-22 21:17:58	@relsqui	too much candies
2014-08-22 21:17:59	@relsqui	v_v
2014-08-22 21:18:09	@relsqui	I have, like, the self-moderation instinct of an untrained dog
2014-08-22 21:18:12	@dom	relsqui: get better candies and I would have taken them from you before you ere sick
2014-08-22 21:18:15	aliaras	and the fact that replacement deskmate will be undoubtedly less cool
2014-08-22 21:18:16	@relsqui	pssht
2014-08-22 21:18:18	@dom	this is only your fault
2014-08-22 21:18:18	aliaras	haha

2014-08-22 21:19:44	@dom	I don
2014-08-22 21:19:46	@relsqui	it looks way too small-scale for civ
2014-08-22 21:19:46	@dom	't know
2014-08-22 21:19:51	@dom	might be df
2014-08-22 21:20:03	@relsqui	no, only seems to have one char
2014-08-22 21:20:08	@relsqui	and v. graphical
2014-08-22 21:20:16	@dom	sounds like HoMMM then
2014-08-22 21:20:21	@relsqui	seems plausible, I know he's a fan
2014-08-22 21:20:25	@dom	yah
2014-08-22 21:21:18	@relsqui	text along the bottom sometimes
2014-08-22 21:21:24	@relsqui	seems to be stuff in the env he can highlight and clic kon

2014-08-22 21:21:35	Pash	I'm getting intrigued

2014-08-22 21:32:40	aliaras	Mostly I'm in that state with drafting where it's like...I really like it, and when I get new pieces of information that stick they *really* stick and I get a lot better
2014-08-22 21:32:47	aliaras	although my deck tonight was terribul
2014-08-22 21:32:53	aliaras	1-2 :(
2014-08-22 21:33:03	@dom	pshaw thats not that bad
2014-08-22 21:33:05	aliaras	although it'd have been 2-1 were it not for mtgo difficulties
2014-08-22 21:33:18	aliaras	dom: mostly it was highly variable :P
2014-08-22 21:33:37	aliaras	the only really really good play I'm smug about was also the one I fucked up
2014-08-22 21:34:22	aliaras	opponent was at 15 life with a bunch of creatures, including three deathtouchers plus Hornet's Nest. I had a 5/3 trampler and some other guys. In my hand: Hammerhand, Lava Axe and Shrapnel Blast. Played Hammerhand on the trampler, targeting Hornet's Nest, and swung.
2014-08-22 21:34:34	aliaras	As expected, the opponent blocked with a 1/1 deathtoucher, taking five damage.
2014-08-22 21:35:05	aliaras	*intended* to sac artifact to get 5 damage in, wait a turn, 5 damage to face with lava axe
2014-08-22 21:35:11	aliaras	actually targeted the artifact I was saccing :(
2014-08-22 21:35:18	@dom	:(
2014-08-22 21:35:23	aliaras	because I clicked so fast because I was really excited that that gambit worked :((((
2014-08-22 21:35:37	@dom	I just don't like the mtgo interface at all
2014-08-22 21:35:45	@dom	or any digital magic interface tbh
2014-08-22 21:35:48	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-22 21:36:00	aliaras	someone commented that the mtgo interface is a debugger
2014-08-22 21:36:00	@dom	papermagic = best magic
2014-08-22 21:36:04	@dom	heh
2014-08-22 21:36:08	aliaras	papermagic is great :)
2014-08-22 21:36:15	 *	aliaras has less papermagic in her life
2014-08-22 21:36:19	@dom	I think hearthstone is just yards ahead of any card game online
2014-08-22 21:36:22	@dom	yeah I hear ya

2014-08-22 21:39:04	@dom	thats how I feel playing the artifact deck
2014-08-22 21:39:06	aliaras	that I saw how to win by fooling my opponent into doing a thing that made total sense for him
2014-08-22 21:39:08	@relsqui	dom: run it against walls or something >_>
2014-08-22 21:39:17	aliaras	and could come from behind with my burny burn stuff
2014-08-22 21:39:19	@relsqui	aliaras: haven't read your scrollback about it yet because I don't have the attention for it rn

2014-08-22 21:45:35	@dom	well he is the cohost
2014-08-22 21:45:41	@relsqui	I might try to see if I can start tolerating podcasts on my commute
2014-08-22 21:45:43	@dom	but he doesn't always talk about drafting
2014-08-22 21:45:47	@dom	podcasts++
2014-08-22 21:45:47	aliaras	awwwwww
2014-08-22 21:45:52	@dom	I dont listen to them a ton
2014-08-22 21:45:56	aliaras	relsqui: yeah I can and do enjoy it
2014-08-22 21:46:01	@dom	(podcasts in general, I mean)
2014-08-22 21:46:02	@relsqui	you and fuckin everyone except me afaict
2014-08-22 21:46:04	aliaras	so if this cast breaks neatly into 30m segments I will listen
2014-08-22 21:46:09	@relsqui	yeah that's the hard part usually
2014-08-22 21:46:11	aliaras	relsqui: eh, varies
2014-08-22 21:46:39	aliaras	relsqui: Eric has been trying to sell me on draft videos, and yes, there's a good series on mtgoacademy ("Simon Says") with a guy who teaches the way I learn
2014-08-22 21:46:52	@relsqui	honestly I'd almost be MORE willing to watch videos
2014-08-22 21:47:00	aliaras	but watching them is infuriating because I will have to pause it and come back and pause and come back and pause and come back...
2014-08-22 21:47:01	@relsqui	I'd just have to make time for it
2014-08-22 21:47:03	@relsqui	YES
2014-08-22 21:47:04	@relsqui	THAT SHIT
2014-08-22 21:47:05	aliaras	oh lol well you take that rec then :P
2014-08-22 21:47:06	@relsqui	ugh
2014-08-22 21:47:16	@relsqui	I just have to do nothing else while I'm doing it
2014-08-22 21:47:20	aliaras	style ~= Shrdlu style so
2014-08-22 21:47:37	@relsqui	?
2014-08-22 21:47:41	@dom	SeemsGoodMagic on Youtube is pretty good
2014-08-22 21:47:42	@relsqui	oh, of teaching?
2014-08-22 21:47:44	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-22 21:47:48	@relsqui	that is good praise :)
2014-08-22 21:48:05	aliaras	this is also a trait Eric has, which is why I liked sitting right next to him
2014-08-22 21:49:01	aliaras	anyways i can't do that for podcasts because i can't spend the time
2014-08-22 21:49:08	aliaras	but i can listen if i'm stuck in a car
2014-08-22 21:49:08	aliaras	so
2014-08-22 21:49:16	aliaras	way easier in car-land than bike-land
2014-08-22 21:49:25	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-22 21:49:28	aliaras	although there was a period when i was commuting and listening while biking
2014-08-22 21:49:34	@relsqui	yeah, vrb does that all the time
2014-08-22 21:49:36	aliaras	because my listening backlog was too damn high
2014-08-22 21:49:52	@relsqui	yeah that's the other reason I never add anything to that queue >_>
2014-08-22 21:50:16	@relsqui	avoids backlog!
2014-08-22 21:52:25	aliaras	yeah well :P
2014-08-22 21:58:00	@dom	oh mana, speculation about khans makes me excited

2014-08-22 22:02:29	@relsqui	hadn't seen that one yet
2014-08-22 22:03:01	@dom	i mean its straight up bad for constructed I think
2014-08-22 22:03:05	@dom	but limited?
2014-08-22 22:03:09	@dom	whoa baby
2014-08-22 22:04:52	aliaras	:OOOOOOO
2014-08-23 00:00:52	-->	magic (steierta@chandra.cs.pdx.edu) has joined #mtg
2014-08-23 09:21:58	aliaras	okay so I'm looking around at Gatherer for cards just to try to understand them better
2014-08-23 09:22:05	aliaras	and I am seeing m15 commons I have *never* seen
2014-08-23 09:22:09	aliaras	e.g. !card Seismic Strike
2014-08-23 09:22:10	oracle	Instant, 2R (3)
2014-08-23 09:22:10	oracle	Seismic Strike deals damage to target creature equal to the number of Mountains you control.
2014-08-23 09:22:28	aliaras	which surprises me, because I've drafted a lot of m15, and then was digging through the box o' cards from everyone *else's* m15 draft
2014-08-23 09:24:58	@mancat	there are cards in the M15 print run that you cannot find in packs
2014-08-23 09:25:06	aliaras	why?
2014-08-23 09:25:09	@mancat	i think they only come in intro deck or something
2014-08-23 09:25:11	aliaras	where do they show up?
2014-08-23 09:25:13	aliaras	weird
2014-08-23 09:25:18	@mancat	i'm not sure if that' sone of them, but it osunds liekly
2014-08-23 09:25:31	aliaras	also i'm looking at gatherer and i think i could draft red/blue/artifacts as a deck
2014-08-23 09:25:31	@mancat	this is the first set that they've ever done that
2014-08-23 09:25:35	@mancat	i agree it's weird
2014-08-23 09:25:46	aliaras	Scrapyard Mongrel, Ensoul Artifact, Aeronaut Tinkerer, all get passed
2014-08-23 09:25:51	aliaras	oh, and Shrapnel Blast
2014-08-23 09:26:11	@mancat	they've made several significant changes to how they're handling limited formats and printing with M15, and i'm not a big fan fo most of them
2014-08-23 09:26:21	aliaras	like what else?
2014-08-23 09:26:47	@mancat	if you went to the M15 prerelease you get to pick one of 5 promo cards
2014-08-23 09:26:52	@mancat	instead of just getting 1 like you did in the past
2014-08-23 09:27:36	@mancat	er, sorry, i don't hink you get to pick, but there are 5 of them
2014-08-23 09:27:46	@mancat	and you get to put it in your deck at the event
2014-08-23 09:27:49	@mancat	but they suck
2014-08-23 09:28:08	@mancat	like they barely qualify as bombs in sealed deck, they're unplayable in constructed
2014-08-23 09:28:30	@mancat	you used to only get 1 promo, you couldn't play it in the event, but it was a promo version of a really good rare from the set
2014-08-23 09:28:31	aliaras	heh
2014-08-23 09:28:36	aliaras	interesting
2014-08-23 09:28:49	@mancat	for example !card Wurmcoil Engine
2014-08-23 09:28:49	oracle	Artifact Creature — Wurm 6/6, 6 (6)
2014-08-23 09:28:49	oracle	Deathtouch, lifelink
2014-08-23 09:28:49	oracle	When Wurmcoil Engine dies, put a 3/3 colorless Wurm artifact creature token with deathtouch and a 3/3 colorless Wurm artifact creature token with lifelink onto the battlefield.
2014-08-23 09:28:56	@mancat	now you get !card Phytotitan
2014-08-23 09:28:57	oracle	Creature — Plant Elemental 7/2, 4GG (6)
2014-08-23 09:28:57	oracle	When Phytotitan dies, return it to the battlefield tapped under its owner's control at the beginning of his or her next upkeep.
2014-08-23 09:28:57	aliaras	oooooh
2014-08-23 09:28:59	@mancat	which is crap
2014-08-23 09:29:07	aliaras	yeah I got a phytotitan with my intro deck
2014-08-23 09:29:10	aliaras	and it was like, v0v
2014-08-23 09:46:22	aliaras	okay I think I have a set of cards I could draft for a red/blue artifact deck
2014-08-23 09:46:35	aliaras	if I get any of the good cards for it in the first 5 it's gonna happen
2014-08-23 09:48:21	aliaras	I'm hoping for Ensoul Artifact/Shrapnel Blast and playable artifacts.
2014-08-23 09:48:30	aliaras	and then the rest I can figure out
2014-08-23 09:52:21	aliaras	got a shrapnel blast
2014-08-23 09:52:23	aliaras	HAPPENINGSTATUS
2014-08-23 09:56:27	aliaras	I passed things because I knew they'd come back and they totally did <3 <3 <3
2014-08-23 11:25:05	@relsqui	mancat: yeah, you got to pick, by choosing which color
2014-08-23 12:57:05	aliaras	!card The Chain Veil
2014-08-23 12:57:06	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-08-23 12:57:13	aliaras	this is a weird-ass mythic
2014-08-23 13:38:25	aliaras	mulligan to 5 but with Yisan in my hand/now on the battlefield: okay I guess this is my 'strategy' now
2014-08-23 13:39:36	aliaras	next go I get a 3-drop, then one of my 4s or 5s
2014-08-23 16:24:30	@relsqui	aliaras: yeahhh it is
2014-08-23 16:24:38	@relsqui	aliaras: do you know the deal with it in the lore?
2014-08-23 16:25:16	aliaras	relsqui: nope!
2014-08-23 16:25:29	@relsqui	tl;dr it's the reason garruk went crazy and started killing walkers >_>
2014-08-23 16:25:29	aliaras	lol Forge AI is bad at drafting
2014-08-23 16:25:37	aliaras	who the hell passes Triplicate Spirits
2014-08-23 16:25:43	aliaras	four times, even
2014-08-23 16:25:47	Golem	thats.....extremely simplified
2014-08-23 16:25:54	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-23 16:25:56	@relsqui	you wanna do the long form?
2014-08-23 16:26:16	@relsqui	aliaras: I mean, anyone not in white? :P
2014-08-23 16:26:18	@relsqui	your colors not only colors
2014-08-23 16:26:36	@relsqui	not that forge AI ISN'T bad at drafting, mind you
2014-08-23 16:26:43	Golem	not really, but thats kinda like saying that a butterfly flapping its wings is the reason for a hurricane and a riot
2014-08-23 16:26:49	@relsqui	hehehe
2014-08-23 16:26:57	@relsqui	I only know it loosely anyway
2014-08-23 16:26:57	aliaras	relsqui: it's true, but I am surprised that nobody in the four positions to my left in pack 1 decided that maybe white was a good idea
2014-08-23 16:27:22	aliaras	and a second one wheeled
2014-08-23 16:29:15	Golem	a better tl;dr would be:  Liliana wants it so she has the power to break the deals she made with several demons
2014-08-23 16:30:26	Golem	Garruk was simply cursed because he happened to get in the way at the wrong time.
2014-08-23 16:33:02	aliaras	so what's that have to do with the veil?
2014-08-23 16:33:23	Golem	All right, time for a longer version
2014-08-23 16:33:33	Golem	basically liliana made a deal with four demon lords
2014-08-23 16:33:39	 *	relsqui popcorn
2014-08-23 16:33:41	Golem	1 soul for immortality and youth
2014-08-23 16:34:12	Golem	But after about a century of servitutde to demon assholes, liliana isnt terribly keen on upholding her side of the bargan
2014-08-23 16:34:43	Golem	So when one of the demons tells her to go get this powerful artifact from some old toumb, she is already looking for a way out
2014-08-23 16:35:03	Golem	enter the chain veil, an artifact that dramatically increases the power of any plansewalker that wears it
2014-08-23 16:35:37	Golem	Liliana goes and fetches the chain veil, but being a none too subtle necromancer, she taints a large swath of nature doing so
2014-08-23 16:35:51	Golem	this ticks off garruk, who happens to be in the area, and they get into a fight
2014-08-23 16:36:02	Golem	liliana is about to loose, puts on the chain veil, and curses garruk
2014-08-23 16:36:23	Golem	realizing the power of the artifact, liliana returns to the demon and kills his ass
2014-08-23 16:36:40	Golem	but the contract was with 4 demons, not one, so its not broken yet
2014-08-23 16:36:52	@relsqui	one down, three to go
2014-08-23 16:37:08	Golem	Liliana heads to innistrad, where the second demon, gristlebrand, was imprisoned by avacyn and sorin
2014-08-23 16:37:19	Golem	She sets him free, then offs him as well
2014-08-23 16:37:22	@relsqui	did sorin help with that? I thought that was just avacyn
2014-08-23 16:37:32	Golem	im not entirely clear about that myself
2014-08-23 16:37:38	@relsqui	I don't *think* he was around for that
2014-08-23 16:37:38	Golem	could have just been acacyn
2014-08-23 16:37:40	@relsqui	yea
2014-08-23 16:37:41	@relsqui	h
2014-08-23 16:37:43	Golem	anyways
2014-08-23 16:37:47	@relsqui	but she had to trap herself to do it. but that's another story.
2014-08-23 16:38:04	Golem	liliana kills gristlebrand, but not before garruk catches up to her and beats her four kinds of bloody
2014-08-23 16:38:14	Golem	only to discover that she has no idea how to undo her own curse
2014-08-23 16:38:30	Golem	Garruk leaves and slowly goes crazy
2014-08-23 16:38:33	@relsqui	avacyn tried, yeah? that was why he was on innistrad
2014-08-23 16:38:36	Golem	yar
2014-08-23 16:38:52	@relsqui	(in which we throw out a bunch of other names aliaras has no reason to know either)
2014-08-23 16:38:53	Golem	but unfortunately he went crazy before she could try (or she tried and couldent help_
2014-08-23 16:38:54	@relsqui	(sorry about that)
2014-08-23 16:38:59	@relsqui	I think she tried and it didn't work
2014-08-23 16:39:19	Golem	And garruk offs his first plansewalker, an agent of Avacyn
2014-08-23 16:39:28	@relsqui	wait, what walker was an agent of avacyn?
2014-08-23 16:39:39	Golem	one not much known
2014-08-23 16:39:44	@relsqui	hm okay
2014-08-23 16:39:47	Golem	id have to look it up
2014-08-23 16:39:54	Golem	if you see the mask garruk is carrying around, thats hsi
2014-08-23 16:39:56	Golem	*his
2014-08-23 16:40:01	@relsqui	whoa, interesting
2014-08-23 16:40:27	Golem	Anydiddle, liliana is still hunting the other 2 demons, garruk is nuts, and we are up to speed
2014-08-23 16:40:34	Golem	last I checked liliana still had the chain veil
2014-08-23 16:40:40	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-23 16:40:49	@relsqui	and I think is kind of fucked if she gives it up at this poitn
2014-08-23 16:40:59	Golem	yup
2014-08-23 16:41:23	Golem	Garruk is hunting all plansewalkers now, even his old allies, and she is likely at the top of that shaky list
2014-08-23 16:42:50	@relsqui	yeah. although he/the curse got weakened recently, yeah?
2014-08-23 16:42:59	@relsqui	stormcrow was telling me about a recent article
2014-08-23 16:43:06	@relsqui	and started with like "so garruk fought jace." "WHAT."
2014-08-23 16:43:12	Golem	oh yeah
2014-08-23 16:43:19	Golem	forgot that part, wasnt relevant to liliana
2014-08-23 16:43:22	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-23 16:43:34	@relsqui	I think of it more as garruk's story, I guess it really is liliana's
2014-08-23 16:43:39	@relsqui	but I've been paying more attention to his part
2014-08-23 16:43:43	Golem	garruk went to revinka for info on where she was.  jace was there, garruk lost his temper, and jace got beat
2014-08-23 16:44:05	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-23 16:44:17	@relsqui	we had this moment of "well obviously they're not going to kill off jace, but .... what if they killed off jace o_o"
2014-08-23 16:44:26	@relsqui	like, wtf happens to ravnica
2014-08-23 16:44:48	Golem	interesting
2014-08-23 16:45:14	Golem	yeah it seems that Garruk went back to shandalar, and was gonna transform into a demon but was stopped by a Hedron artifact
2014-08-23 16:45:20	@relsqui	ohh, yeah
2014-08-23 16:45:28	@relsqui	something about someone getting a hedron implanted into them or somethign?
2014-08-23 16:45:31	@relsqui	I obviously didn't actually read this thing
2014-08-23 16:45:35	Golem	yar
2014-08-23 16:45:46	@relsqui	I haven't done the zendikar wikiwalk yet so I just hear "hedron" and think "eldrazi O_O"
2014-08-23 16:45:47	Golem	well time will tell if its just surpressing the problem or curing it
2014-08-23 16:45:52	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-23 16:45:59	Golem	hedrons were only supposed to imprison the eldrazi sooooooo
2014-08-23 16:47:30	Golem	INnnnntereesssttinnggg
2014-08-23 16:47:37	Golem	so suposedly the chain veil is haunted
2014-08-23 16:47:49	Golem	by ancient Onakke (ogre) spirits
2014-08-23 16:48:14	Golem	the Onakke made the veil and their spirits are now haunting liliana whenever she uses it
2014-08-23 16:51:20	@relsqui	so basically she's just beholden to different creature snow
2014-08-23 16:51:33	@relsqui	anyway, relatedly, afk reteaching my friend zigdon to play ^_^

2014-08-23 17:48:36	@dom	oh derp of course
2014-08-23 17:48:37	@relsqui	aliaras: I'm not sure ... it might be using the flashback lightning bolt icon near the library icons and stuff?
2014-08-23 17:48:40	@dom	ill be down in a sec
2014-08-23 17:48:51	@relsqui	k
2014-08-23 17:48:56	aliaras	relsqui: yeah it is :)
2014-08-23 17:50:38	@relsqui	okay cool

2014-08-23 20:51:14	aliaras	as if you can play it, the next turn you have all the life and all the boardp osition
2014-08-23 20:51:28	aliaras	the next time you untap*
2014-08-23 20:52:32	@dom	I mean, all of the souls are that though
2014-08-23 20:53:17	aliaras	Ehhhhhhhh yes and no
2014-08-23 20:53:32	aliaras	Soul of Ravnica looks pretty weaksauce tbh
2014-08-23 20:53:46	aliaras	5UU: draw two cards
2014-08-23 20:53:51	aliaras	(probably)
2014-08-23 20:55:01	aliaras	for Soul of Theros, if you're winning, you're winning really hard. If you're stalemated, you now have that whole +2/+2 first strike/lifelink thing going on, which means you can probably swing with everything or near it (as lifegain is *like* blockers...)
2014-08-23 20:55:34	aliaras	if you're losing, you're at worst now stalemated for the same reason, as your fewer creatures can really really effectively block even the good incoming ones
2014-08-23 20:55:46	aliaras	and in the intervening attack phase, hey, nobody ever said no to a 6/6
2014-08-23 20:57:06	@dom	soul of ravnica is pretty shit, yeah
2014-08-23 20:57:09	aliaras	soul of new phyrexia is almost that one-sidedly awesome but 'indestructable' isn't nearly as good as first strike/lifelink IM (limited :P) E
2014-08-23 20:57:41	@dom	soul of theros is only good with pridemate in draft I think where board states just stall out
2014-08-23 20:58:17	@dom	and I really wouldn't play the majority of soul cards in drafted decks >>

2014-08-23 21:00:01	aliaras	it's great with any creatures
2014-08-23 21:00:09	@dom	yes, its great *in draft*
2014-08-23 21:00:14	@dom	regardless of having pridemate
2014-08-23 21:00:24	aliaras	ah ok, I misread you
2014-08-23 21:00:28	@dom	but I was objecting to the "with pridemate" part
2014-08-23 21:00:32	aliaras	yeah :)
2014-08-23 21:00:40	aliaras	nah I just found it with pridemate to be hilarious
2014-08-23 21:00:55	aliaras	had both out in a forge draft and had an 11/11 that started at 2 mana :P
2014-08-23 21:01:02	@dom	yah
2014-08-23 21:01:12	@dom	pridemate is just hilarious in draft because nobody can stop it
2014-08-23 21:01:24	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-23 21:01:31	aliaras	although a good bounce on it is kinda funny
2014-08-23 21:01:39	@dom	yah
2014-08-23 21:01:42	@dom	see blue control
2014-08-23 21:01:48	@dom	or ru tempo
2014-08-23 21:01:59	aliaras	I should see if I can make ru tempo work
2014-08-23 21:02:10	aliaras	wu control sorta worked (that was where i had the soul)
2014-08-23 21:02:20	aliaras	which i think was p1p1
2014-08-23 21:03:43	aliaras	I drafted an over-the-top boros deck in forge that would never have been passed to me in a real game, it was kinda fun
2014-08-23 21:04:17	@dom	I like boros a lot in m15 draft
2014-08-23 21:04:31	@dom	I think white is really strong in m15 hands down
2014-08-23 21:05:30	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-23 21:05:35	aliaras	agreed
2014-08-23 21:05:49	aliaras	I like boros a lot in m15 draft; I was less happy when I was playing the third boros deck of my draft pool
2014-08-23 21:15:49	aliaras	okay sleeptime for me
2014-08-24 11:21:58	aliaras	decks which went 2-1: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i41kddspl7tpnfn/Screenshot%202014-08-24%2011.45.28.png?dl=0

2014-08-24 17:52:35	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-24 17:52:50	@relsqui	mancat: that card has three faults
2014-08-24 17:52:58	@relsqui	of which the two least egregious are that it doesn't do much and it's way too expensive
2014-08-24 17:53:01	@relsqui	and the greatest is that it's boring.
2014-08-24 17:54:18	@relsqui	mancat: also I really wanna watch more wakfu now -_-; it's just getting good!!
2014-08-24 17:54:28	 *	dom keks
2014-08-24 17:55:40	@dom	im a bit bored by the lack of sadlygrove and ruel ( and no one is surprised by that)
2014-08-24 17:56:03	@relsqui	that's part of why I wanna see where current storyline goes
2014-08-24 18:02:02	@relsqui	... okay this + another channel are making me want to eat ice cream and watch wakfu. do you guys want to eat ice cream and watch wakfu?
2014-08-24 18:02:46	@dom	I would be down for a little of those
2014-08-24 18:02:50	@relsqui	mancat: ^
2014-08-24 18:28:46	aliaras	mancat: right?!?!?!?! I opened Garruk p1p1, then got Caustic Tar, and then it was off to the races
2014-08-24 18:28:54	aliaras	Stab Wound was p2p1
2014-08-24 18:29:12	aliaras	only thing I lost to was boros aggro with too much combat tricks/burn for what I had
2014-08-24 18:29:16	aliaras	but it was a tight loss
2014-08-24 18:29:31	aliaras	the gchat logs of that are like 'I've got this i've got this i've got this FUCK jk i lost"
2014-08-24 18:29:35	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-24 18:30:50	aliaras	anyways afk back to girls >_>

2014-08-24 18:43:36	aliaras	oh also in that draft: an honest to god mill deck
2014-08-24 18:43:56	@relsqui	did someone pull like four mind sculpt?
2014-08-24 18:44:15	aliaras	three mind sculpts, i won game 1 by using garruks wake against a 1/1 soldier and a black paragon
2014-08-24 18:44:34	aliaras	and won with 1 card in deck
2014-08-24 18:44:34	 *	relsqui counts on fingers
2014-08-24 18:44:39	@relsqui	okay yeah three is still a lot in limited
2014-08-24 18:44:43	aliaras	yes
2014-08-24 18:44:44	@relsqui	heh nice
2014-08-24 18:45:01	aliaras	zof shade was a real bro there
2014-08-24 18:46:04	aliaras	next game sided in all graveyard interactive cards, won handily just playing aggro
2014-08-24 18:47:33	@relsqui	aliaras: I honestly envy your ability to pour time into this
2014-08-24 18:47:38	@relsqui	not even, like, logistical ability
2014-08-24 18:47:41	@relsqui	mental/emotional
2014-08-24 18:48:22	aliaras	heh, nod
2014-08-24 18:49:40	aliaras	doubt I'll play longer than a year
2014-08-24 18:49:59	@relsqui	yah, but you are probably already a better player than I am
2014-08-24 18:50:14	@relsqui	def. drafter

2014-08-25 10:39:08	aliaras	as a new player who likes drafting core set right now a lot I'm a little :(
2014-08-25 10:39:45	aliaras	I'm not sure why I'm so :( at the idea of there being a thing for new players and other players, but I think it has to do with feeling like not a REAL magic player or like a little kid, both of which are things which irk me for other reasons
2014-08-25 10:40:53	@relsqui	core is for everybody, it's just designed to be accessible to new players
2014-08-25 10:40:56	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-25 10:41:01	aliaras	that's why I've liked it
2014-08-25 10:41:11	@relsqui	also, if you like it more than drafting theros, you're not alone :P
2014-08-25 10:41:12	Golem	Good, its already being talked about
2014-08-25 10:41:18	@relsqui	> Maro, I'm scared. The reaction has been relatively positive! Magic players accepting change! You ARE killing the game!
2014-08-25 10:41:20	Golem	just poped on to see if anyone else had spotted that
2014-08-25 10:41:21	@relsqui	^ hahahaha
2014-08-25 10:41:27	Golem	;p
2014-08-25 10:41:35	aliaras	relsqui:
2014-08-25 10:41:36	aliaras	This led to the next rather radical proposal.what if we got rid of the core set? As I explained above, the core set has had a split identity problem for years, and it was only getting worse. What if we used the summer slot for the small set for the second block? This would mean we'd have to solve the problem of what to do with new players, but there had already been talk of creating a product line solely for them, anyway.
2014-08-25 10:41:38	Golem	the wierd thing is, that scared person might be right
2014-08-25 10:41:42	aliaras	^ this is the paragraph that bothered me
2014-08-25 10:41:54	Golem	I'll reserve judgement I suppose
2014-08-25 10:42:03	Golem	Yar
2014-08-25 10:42:18	Golem	I think they have forgotten what the core set was and why it existed for new players
2014-08-25 10:42:24	@relsqui	aliaras: the split identity thing is that it's supposed to be accessible but *also* provide reprints and tools for everyone else
2014-08-25 10:42:29	@relsqui	Golem: they're doing a new thing for new players also
2014-08-25 10:42:39	Golem	Yar, but thats not my point
2014-08-25 10:42:42	aliaras	relsqui: yeah, I get that, but I don't think that's a total drawback
2014-08-25 10:42:47	Golem	the core set wasnt FOR new players or old players
2014-08-25 10:42:51	aliaras	the idea of a thing specifically for new players bothers me
2014-08-25 10:42:55	@relsqui	aliaras: oh, I see.
2014-08-25 10:42:59	 *	relsqui shrugs
2014-08-25 10:43:03	Golem	it just happened to be the place with the most simple cards, which is why you sent new players there
2014-08-25 10:43:05	@relsqui	I don't have an opinion about that until I see what it is.
2014-08-25 10:43:12	@relsqui	Golem: it didn't "just happen" to be, that was on purpose :P
2014-08-25 10:43:32	Golem	The core set was (originally) supposed to be a place where all the baseline tools for each color were stored
2014-08-25 10:43:39	@relsqui	aliaras: I mean, the sample decks are for specifically for new players, and I still think those are great
2014-08-25 10:43:42	aliaras	I mean, whatever it is, if it's for new players but not experienced magic players, you run into one of my two things: "I'm not a *real* magic player" and "well, guess I'm just a little kid who has to do her time before eating at the big kid's table"
2014-08-25 10:43:51	Golem	So they didnt have to reprint another green mana dork, a white wrath, a black kill spell, and so on, every set
2014-08-25 10:43:53	aliaras	relsqui: right but they have all the cards that are in non-new player decks
2014-08-25 10:44:03	@relsqui	aliaras: who says the new thing won't also be like that?
2014-08-25 10:44:17	@relsqui	the core set wasn't newbie cards, it was a subset of real cards that are newbie-accessible
2014-08-25 10:44:23	@relsqui	I see no reason they'll stop doing it that way
2014-08-25 10:44:26	Golem	Bingo ^
2014-08-25 10:44:44	aliaras	because they just talked about doing that?
2014-08-25 10:44:48	Golem	;p
2014-08-25 10:45:00	@relsqui	what part of the column made it sound like they won't be doing it that way any more?
2014-08-25 10:45:19	aliaras	I mean, "creating a product line just for them" doesn't sound like "we will be incorporating new-player onboarding into the same stuff that's going into the larger metagame"
2014-08-25 10:45:26	aliaras	the way core set is
2014-08-25 10:45:28	@relsqui	ah; I disagree
2014-08-25 10:45:29	Golem	The part where they elminate the core set enitirely?
2014-08-25 10:45:32	@relsqui	I see why you read it that way
2014-08-25 10:45:36	@relsqui	but I don't think that's what that means
2014-08-25 10:45:41	@relsqui	if for no other reason, they TRIED that
2014-08-25 10:45:46	@relsqui	and from what I hear it sucked :P
2014-08-25 10:45:56	@relsqui	so I don't imagine they'll do it again
2014-08-25 10:45:57	Golem	it did, and RND is not above repeating mistakes
2014-08-25 10:46:01	aliaras	^
2014-08-25 10:46:04	Golem	make no mistake about THAT
2014-08-25 10:46:12	@relsqui	aliaras: "product line" doesn't mean "whole separate set of cards which aren't interchangeable"
2014-08-25 10:46:15	Golem	however, I hope they will learn from last time
2014-08-25 10:46:19	Golem	Mmmmmmmmmmm
2014-08-25 10:46:21	@relsqui	conspiracy is a separate product line from expansions
2014-08-25 10:46:24	Golem	maybie?
2014-08-25 10:46:25	@relsqui	so's commander
2014-08-25 10:46:34	aliaras	Conspiracy and Commander are actually a great example of what I don't want
2014-08-25 10:46:36	@relsqui	so are the from the vault packs, etc.
2014-08-25 10:46:46	Golem	Both of those catered to strong subsets of an existing magic community
2014-08-25 10:47:11	Golem	If you want to bring people into the game, I think it is smart to make sure the cards they start playing with are also the cards they can start playing competatively with
2014-08-25 10:47:21	Golem	That being said
2014-08-25 10:47:30	Golem	we dont know what their new scheme is yet
2014-08-25 10:47:41	Golem	So I wouldent worry until we know what they are doing
2014-08-25 10:47:44	aliaras	>_>
2014-08-25 10:47:57	@relsqui	eh, I think it's okay to teach arithmetic before you teach calculus. you'll still use numbers, later, just not only them :P
2014-08-25 10:48:23	Golem	Generally, you dont pay to use numbers ;p
2014-08-25 10:48:35	@relsqui	lol "maybe now we get to go back to Kamigawa!" "we now get to visit twice as many worlds per year, and I'm not sure even that gets us back to Kamigawa"
2014-08-25 10:48:41	@relsqui	poor Kamigawa fans
2014-08-25 10:48:49	aliaras	haha
2014-08-25 10:48:50	Golem	I liked kamigawa :(
2014-08-25 10:48:56	@relsqui	you and half of blogatog apparently
2014-08-25 10:49:18	Golem	It was a good set to be a green mage, even if they did print one of the most broken equipment of all time
2014-08-25 10:49:29	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-25 10:49:44	@relsqui	oh man ... so since they knew about this change and we didn't, they had to come up with three-set codenames that worked for two sets
2014-08-25 10:49:47	@relsqui	so they did
2014-08-25 10:49:48	@relsqui	because obviously.
2014-08-25 10:49:50	Golem	;p
2014-08-25 10:49:52	Golem	hehe
2014-08-25 10:49:56	@relsqui	blood/sweat/tears is actually blood/sweat and tears/fears
2014-08-25 10:50:03	@relsqui	lock/stock/barrel is lock/stock and barrel/monkeys
2014-08-25 10:50:04	@relsqui	XD
2014-08-25 10:50:12	aliaras	XD
2014-08-25 10:50:14	Golem	This amuses the golem
2014-08-25 10:51:20	Golem	I have concerns with thier new idea that they didnt address, and I suspect that have passed them by because RND doesnt really think about the trading side of things
2014-08-25 10:51:30	Golem	Mostly anyways
2014-08-25 10:51:58	Golem	One thing is that without a core set, they will either need to step up the pace of in-block reprints, or find another way to make old cards remain relevant
2014-08-25 10:51:58	aliaras	hmm?
2014-08-25 10:52:05	aliaras	Ah, yeah
2014-08-25 10:52:18	aliaras	The trading thing is also a concern for the 'new player' product line
2014-08-25 10:52:26	@relsqui	Golem: they're stepping up the pace of in-block reprints
2014-08-25 10:52:33	aliaras	For example, I subsidize my drafting habit by trading bomb-ass shit I draft for more packs
2014-08-25 10:52:34	@relsqui	question asked and answered on blogatog
2014-08-25 10:52:39	Golem	Ahhhh
2014-08-25 10:52:41	Golem	Well good
2014-08-25 10:52:43	@relsqui	aliaras: you and everyone I think, haha
2014-08-25 10:52:51	@relsqui	well, I do it with mm
2014-08-25 10:52:53	@relsqui	but same principle
2014-08-25 10:52:56	aliaras	which I can do because someone wants to have my bombs to play in Standard, and I want more packs
2014-08-25 10:52:59	aliaras	yeah :P
2014-08-25 10:53:08	Golem	Welcome to being a magic player ^_^
2014-08-25 10:53:40	@relsqui	*g*
2014-08-25 10:53:45	Golem	On a similar note however, its likely going to be even more expensive to play standard
2014-08-25 10:54:10	@relsqui	someone asked about that too
2014-08-25 10:54:12	Golem	Shorter block rotations means more new cards and more cards rotating out faster
2014-08-25 10:54:14	@relsqui	I forget the entire response
2014-08-25 10:54:27	aliaras	Anyways, learning to draft in a block environment sounds a bit miserable, and being unable to trade new player cards to vets for their standard decks is also miserable
2014-08-25 10:54:31	aliaras	because dat drafting price tag
2014-08-25 10:54:52	Golem	You always learn to draft in a block enviroment ;p
2014-08-25 10:54:55	Golem	but your point is taken
2014-08-25 10:55:14	aliaras	haha
2014-08-25 10:55:23	aliaras	It's already really hard :(
2014-08-25 10:55:35	@relsqui	I still don't think there will be a thing that's "new player cards" any more than there is now
2014-08-25 10:55:46	@relsqui	like, I dunno why you guys jumped to that conclusion
2014-08-25 10:55:53	@relsqui	that does not seem like a likely solution to me
2014-08-25 10:56:17	aliaras	because they mention it as something that's not the blocks, and they mention just the blocks as standard-legal
2014-08-25 10:56:21	aliaras	that's why.
2014-08-25 10:56:23	Golem	Because its the solution they have tried like 3 times already and its been terrible each time?
2014-08-25 10:57:17	@relsqui	Golem: what're the other two?
2014-08-25 10:57:21	Golem	But I reserve judgement.  I am of the opinion that new players need a safe and loving enviroment to learn in, not neccesarily an easy one
2014-08-25 10:57:25	Golem	White bordered sets
2014-08-25 10:57:58	@relsqui	if you wanna give 'em a safe and loving environment, work on the community culture. :)
2014-08-25 10:58:06	Golem	exactly
2014-08-25 10:58:07	aliaras	yeah, well, that helps a lot :)
2014-08-25 10:58:55	Golem	Give them the real cards.  They will want to learn the mechanics anyways eventually, so start em easy with the basic keywords and then let them ask questions about the more complex stuff
2014-08-25 10:59:14	@relsqui	oh my god why are we arguing about this
2014-08-25 10:59:16	@relsqui	we DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL BE
2014-08-25 10:59:25	@relsqui	I'm not going to sit here and fucking argue about something that none of us know
2014-08-25 10:59:25	Golem	Because nerds

2014-08-25 10:59:32	@relsqui	no, that's stupid

2014-08-25 11:00:00	@relsqui	yes, because everyone involved has all the information
2014-08-25 11:00:04	@relsqui	so you can *have* an argument
2014-08-25 11:00:06	Golem	Ah I see
2014-08-25 11:00:11	Golem	So yeah
2014-08-25 11:00:16	Golem	reserve judgement, wait and see
2014-08-25 11:00:19	@relsqui	yeah. christ.
2014-08-25 11:00:24	@relsqui	we're not going to know for like two years anyway
2014-08-25 11:01:35	@relsqui	I'm more interested in what they're going to do for the last core set :)
2014-08-25 11:01:39	Golem	There exists the possibility for abuse in all change, this is no differant.  And I will credit RND with one thing: They do genuinely try to make the game better.

2014-08-25 11:05:48	@relsqui	well, let me back up. I remember to get shit done by making it a scheduled task on my calendar
2014-08-25 11:05:58	@relsqui	so it reminds me it has to get done and also I pick a time to do it
2014-08-25 11:06:11	@relsqui	and I've learned this neat trick where I put work-related tasks *on my work hours*
2014-08-25 11:06:23	@relsqui	and then .... and then I don't feel like I have to be working *all the time*
2014-08-25 11:06:57	aliaras	:D

2014-08-25 11:09:00	@relsqui	when I was newer and only half-remembered the way the block structure had been explained to me
2014-08-25 11:09:02	Golem	Should be interesting
2014-08-25 11:09:09	@relsqui	a) it was confusing, and b) I was disappointed that there was only one expansion block a year
2014-08-25 11:10:03	@relsqui	oh thank god I correctly remembered/calculated when my payday this month is
2014-08-25 11:10:12	@relsqui	(it's "last business day of the month" so it's a little earlier this month than usual)
2014-08-25 11:10:18	@relsqui	which is good because I'm Super Broke
2014-08-25 11:10:31	aliaras	heh

2014-08-25 11:11:57	@relsqui	Golem: so they challenged me to make a black/white deck without creatures
2014-08-25 11:12:04	@relsqui	I forget if it was supposed to be a kind of deck other than that
2014-08-25 11:12:19	@relsqui	tl;dr I have like fifteen card tabs open and I'm having a really hard time putting white in this >_>
2014-08-25 11:12:25	@relsqui	I might have to, like

The first player may reveal cards from the top of his or her library until he or she reveals a creature card. If he or she does, that player puts that card onto the battlefield and all other cards revealed this way into his or her graveyard.

2014-08-25 11:21:35	Golem	Yup, if its scornful egotist then its always going to be a bit more disapointing than you hoped

2014-08-25 11:50:34	@mancat	it's like "Look neckbeards, things are gonna change again. Remember M10 and how we changed everything? It's happening again. Get your rage caps on."
2014-08-25 11:50:41	Golem	lol
2014-08-25 11:50:47	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-08-25 11:50:55	@relsqui	(what was M10?)
2014-08-25 11:51:00	@relsqui	I mean, what was its change
2014-08-25 11:51:05	@mancat	um
2014-08-25 11:51:05	Golem	M10 was the change to the borders
2014-08-25 11:51:06	@mancat	several things
2014-08-25 11:51:07	Golem	from the old style
2014-08-25 11:51:11	Golem	and several other things
2014-08-25 11:51:25	@mancat	they abolished mana burn, damange stopped using the stack, and mana pools flushed every phase instead of every step
2014-08-25 11:51:30	@mancat	those are the three big one si remember
2014-08-25 11:51:33	@relsqui	ah!
2014-08-25 11:51:37	@relsqui	yeah okay those are big
2014-08-25 11:52:28	Golem	phase instead of turn wasnt it?
2014-08-25 11:52:45	Golem	ah well
2014-08-25 11:52:47	Golem	terminology
2014-08-25 11:52:54	Golem	tl;dr, Lotsa changes
2014-08-25 11:53:03	Golem	I still miss damage on the stack ;_;
2014-08-25 11:53:06	@mancat	no it used to eb step
2014-08-25 11:53:18	@mancat	like mana would flush between declare attackers and declare blockers
2014-08-25 11:53:21	@mancat	now it's every phase
2014-08-25 11:53:23	Golem	ahh
2014-08-25 11:53:25	@mancat	i'm like 85% sure
2014-08-25 11:53:29	@mancat	it might be the other waya round
2014-08-25 11:53:31	@relsqui	XD
2014-08-25 11:53:31	@mancat	but it was never turn
2014-08-25 11:53:32	Golem	hehe
2014-08-25 11:53:35	Golem	well its phases mow
2014-08-25 11:53:36	Golem	*now
2014-08-25 11:53:54	Golem	so I dunno
2014-08-25 11:54:14	Golem	the idea of floating mana has been around since the beggining, but i didnt play with it as a mechanic until the psychatog days
2014-08-25 11:55:46	@relsqui	mancat: so I'm trying to build this white/black deck and I'm having trouble putting white in it. I may have to finish making the monoblack deck and then get back to you v_v
2014-08-25 11:55:52	Golem	Right, im off to eat and then to head in to desking

2014-08-25 11:56:50	@relsqui	it's not a control deck >_>
2014-08-25 11:56:57	@relsqui	I forget, did you guys tell me to make a control deck?
2014-08-25 11:56:59	@mancat	mono black with no creatures?
2014-08-25 11:57:00	@relsqui	yes.
2014-08-25 11:57:07	@mancat	are you playing mono-black combo?

2014-08-25 11:57:11	@relsqui	<_<

2014-08-25 11:57:52	@mancat	are you playing Lotus Petal and Lion's Eye Diamond?
2014-08-25 11:58:22	@relsqui	yes and no respectively.
2014-08-25 11:58:26	@relsqui	the latter for two reasons
2014-08-25 11:58:45	@mancat	let me guess
2014-08-25 11:58:48	@relsqui	the nominal reason is that I'm not proxying $90 cards
2014-08-25 11:58:50	@mancat	1. it's really ahrd to play with
2014-08-25 11:58:55	@mancat	2. what the hell is that card, anyway
2014-08-25 11:58:57	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-08-25 11:59:02	@relsqui	and the other one is, yeah, I don't know how to do the timing
2014-08-25 11:59:17	@mancat	basically the card that makes it playable is !card Grim Tutor
2014-08-25 11:59:17	oracle	Sorcery, 1BB (3)
2014-08-25 11:59:17	oracle	Search your library for a card and put that card into your hand, then shuffle your library. You lose 3 life.
2014-08-25 11:59:37	@mancat	you cast grim tutor, and in response crack LED to get hellbent and for mana to cast what you find with
2014-08-25 11:59:40	@relsqui	I like that the ruling about the timing actually just says "yes, this is a bit weird"
2014-08-25 11:59:46	@mancat	a common target is !card Ad Nauseam
2014-08-25 11:59:46	oracle	Instant, 3BB (5)
2014-08-25 11:59:46	oracle	Reveal the top card of your library and put that card into your hand. You lose life equal to its converted mana cost. You may repeat this process any number of times.
2014-08-25 11:59:48	@mancat	or else Tendrils
2014-08-25 11:59:55	@relsqui	nice
2014-08-25 12:00:26	@mancat	in legacy Ad Nauseam Tendrils you can fairly reliably draw like 20-25 cards with Ad Nauseam
2014-08-25 12:00:40	@relsqui	right because deck is full of cheap things
2014-08-25 12:00:43	@relsqui	and wtf do I need life total for
2014-08-25 12:00:52	@mancat	but you only play 1 Ad Nauseam and 1 Tendrils because flipping Ad Nauseam with Ad Nauseam is often a death sentence
2014-08-25 12:01:04	@relsqui	heh
2014-08-25 12:01:12	@relsqui	eenteresting
2014-08-25 12:01:25	@mancat	this deck usually plays lots of blue though
2014-08-25 12:01:34	@mancat	also sometimes one-of !card Past in Flames
2014-08-25 12:01:35	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-08-25 12:01:42	@mancat	or !card Burning Wish
2014-08-25 12:01:42	oracle	Sorcery, 1R (2)
2014-08-25 12:01:42	oracle	You may choose a sorcery card you own from outside the game, reveal that card, and put it into your hand. Exile Burning Wish.
2014-08-25 12:01:51	@mancat	in which case your sideboard is just a tutor library
2014-08-25 12:01:55	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-25 12:02:07	@relsqui	so okay here's a problem I keep having
2014-08-25 12:02:12	@mancat	yeah?
2014-08-25 12:02:23	@relsqui	where's the line between "this is an archetype, and these are cards that are known to work well in it" and netdecking
2014-08-25 12:02:36	@mancat	you're right, that is a problem
2014-08-25 12:02:41	@relsqui	I wanna be doing my own thing and I wanna be doing a thing well, and I don't know how to do both
2014-08-25 12:02:49	@mancat	i completely understand
2014-08-25 12:02:57	@mancat	the answer is highly personal though
2014-08-25 12:03:06	@mancat	i have spent many time agonizing over that
2014-08-25 12:03:16	@relsqui	that's slightly reassuring
2014-08-25 12:03:20	@relsqui	in a not-just-me sense
2014-08-25 12:03:26	@mancat	finally i've settled on "If I haven't actually copied any part of this deck from a decklist i found online, i'm not netdecking"
2014-08-25 12:03:35	@mancat	and then i jsut accept that most of the best decks are already known quanitites
2014-08-25 12:03:42	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-25 12:03:54	@relsqui	(on a side note, burn just won modern in Kobe and that makes me happy on principle)
2014-08-25 12:03:56	aliaras	netdecking?
2014-08-25 12:04:02	@relsqui	aliaras: getting a decklist from the internet
2014-08-25 12:04:04	aliaras	ahhhh
2014-08-25 12:04:08	@relsqui	because they're all public
2014-08-25 12:04:12	@relsqui	so you can just grab something out of the top eight and go
2014-08-25 12:04:19	aliaras	yeah, have done that
2014-08-25 12:04:33	aliaras	as an archetype-tester thing
2014-08-25 12:04:36	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-25 12:04:44	@relsqui	I mean, yeah, I've mancatdecked *g*
2014-08-25 12:04:55	@relsqui	which is a difference of degree but perhaps not kind
2014-08-25 12:04:58	aliaras	haha
2014-08-25 12:05:02	@relsqui	mancat: hi, you're a verb now
2014-08-25 12:05:35	aliaras	tbh that's part of why I'm more excited about drafting than standard atm, because standard I feel like I could netdeck or just make something shitty and have a hard time figuring out why it's shitty
2014-08-25 12:05:43	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-25 12:05:47	@relsqui	it's a nice thing about limited!
2014-08-25 12:05:54	aliaras	wheras drafting is a new round of deckbuilding every time and if it's shitty then I'll probably know what I could have used
2014-08-25 12:05:54	@relsqui	I appreciate that as well for the same reason
2014-08-25 12:06:05	@mancat	relsqui: i'm not sure if you've noticed, but everything is a verb when you're around :P
2014-08-25 12:06:11	@relsqui	..... v_v
2014-08-25 12:06:14	aliaras	XD
2014-08-25 12:06:22	@relsqui	.oO (he's got my number)
2014-08-25 12:06:35	@mancat	867-5309?
2014-08-25 12:06:58	aliaras	anyways I feel like when I've got a better handle on what works and *why* things work then I can go back to building decks more
2014-08-25 12:07:24	aliaras	I guess I could go look up a deck similar to my fast red one and see what's different and kinda ask why
2014-08-25 12:08:08	@relsqui	mancat++
2014-08-25 12:08:22	@relsqui	aliaras: you can also, if you wanna learn from tournament decks, watch the tournaments!
2014-08-25 12:08:27	aliaras	relsqui: that's true!
2014-08-25 12:08:32	aliaras	I watched some of the pro tour
2014-08-25 12:08:33	@relsqui	dom and I were doing that a little last night
2014-08-25 12:08:41	@relsqui	although not very much because DID YOU KNOW computers are terriblE?
2014-08-25 12:08:54	aliaras	It's mostly just not where I want to put my energy because it is more likely to lead to me being frustrated than having fun
2014-08-25 12:09:00	aliaras	because of being a very very learn-by-doing person
2014-08-25 12:09:07	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-25 12:09:16	aliaras	and see aforementioned about building either shitty decks or copying
2014-08-25 12:09:20	aliaras	and building shitty decks is frustrating
2014-08-25 12:11:18	@relsqui	yeah.
2014-08-25 12:11:24	@relsqui	is kinda where I am also
2014-08-25 12:11:33	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-25 12:11:38	aliaras	building challenge decks sounds fun though :P
2014-08-25 12:11:53	@relsqui	:D we should give aliaras one
2014-08-25 12:11:59	aliaras	Kay :D
2014-08-25 12:12:38	@mancat	i don't know enough about what kinda decks you build
2014-08-25 12:12:44	@mancat	all i know is you like selesnia tokens
2014-08-25 12:14:08	@relsqui	clearly she should come to our club >_>
2014-08-25 12:14:17	@mancat	lol yes
2014-08-25 12:14:20	@relsqui	because she definitely doesn't have, like, a day job and her own life that needs taking care of several thousand miles away
2014-08-25 12:15:08	aliaras	I really like pdx tho
2014-08-25 12:15:24	@mancat	^_^
2014-08-25 12:15:27	@mancat	pdx is a good place
2014-08-25 12:15:31	aliaras	mancat: I am flexible right now. I liked selesnya tokens. I made a very fast red deck that was fun. I had my baller-as-shit Golgari draft deck which owned
2014-08-25 12:15:42	aliaras	golgari in general is pretty cool
2014-08-25 12:15:43	@relsqui	for the swarm \o/
2014-08-25 12:15:45	aliaras	big big things
2014-08-25 12:15:49	@relsqui	oh man
2014-08-25 12:15:49	@mancat	no kidding, lol
2014-08-25 12:15:52	@relsqui	big golgari things
2014-08-25 12:15:56	@relsqui	tell her about the one you just built mancat
2014-08-25 12:15:57	@relsqui	lmao
2014-08-25 12:16:07	@mancat	lol that deck is stupid
2014-08-25 12:16:09	@relsqui	it's great
2014-08-25 12:16:14	@relsqui	I love it
2014-08-25 12:16:25	@mancat	ok dom gave me a challenge deck where i'm playing !card Verdant Eidolon
2014-08-25 12:16:25	oracle	Creature — Spirit 2/2, 3G (4)
2014-08-25 12:16:25	oracle	{G}, Sacrifice Verdant Eidolon: Add three mana of any one color to your mana pool.
2014-08-25 12:16:25	oracle	Whenever you cast a multicolored spell, you may return Verdant Eidolon from your graveyard to your hand.
2014-08-25 12:16:29	@relsqui	(You Might Be a Melvin If)
2014-08-25 12:16:29	@mancat	4-of
2014-08-25 12:16:40	@mancat	and 4-of 4 other creatures that are part of a cycle with that
2014-08-25 12:16:59	@mancat	they're all 4-cost 2/2s with a sac ability that return from graveyard to hand when you cast a multicolored spell
2014-08-25 12:17:04	@mancat	the rest of the deck ahs to eb singleton
2014-08-25 12:17:31	@mancat	so the obvious choice for this deck was Lotleth Troll
2014-08-25 12:17:44	aliaras	relsqui: Melvin?
2014-08-25 12:17:53	@mancat	the last game i played with it i played a lotleth troll, and by the time i swung with it next turn it was a 56/53
2014-08-25 12:17:56	@relsqui	aliaras: we'll come back to it
2014-08-25 12:17:58	aliaras	mancat: holy shit
2014-08-25 12:18:01	@mancat	lol
2014-08-25 12:18:02	aliaras	!card Lotleth Troll
2014-08-25 12:18:02	oracle	Creature — Zombie Troll 2/1, BG (2)
2014-08-25 12:18:02	oracle	Trample
2014-08-25 12:18:02	oracle	Discard a creature card: Put a +1/+1 counter on Lotleth Troll.
2014-08-25 12:18:02	oracle	{B}: Regenerate Lotleth Troll.
2014-08-25 12:18:09	@relsqui	<3 lotleth troll
2014-08-25 12:18:36	@relsqui	you may remember him from such synergies as !card slitherhead
2014-08-25 12:18:36	oracle	Creature — Plant Zombie 1/1, {B/G} (1)
2014-08-25 12:18:36	oracle	Scavenge {0} ({0}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to this card's power on target creature. Scavenge only as a sorcery.)
2014-08-25 12:19:27	aliaras	don't see the synergy, you still need to get the cards to the graveyard
2014-08-25 12:19:50	@relsqui	that's what lotleth troll does
2014-08-25 12:19:55	@relsqui	lets you discard creatures
2014-08-25 12:19:58	@relsqui	arbitrarily
2014-08-25 12:20:26	@relsqui	the combo with slitherhead is you drop troll, discard slitherhead, then exile slitherhead and put the counter on troll
2014-08-25 12:20:30	@relsqui	and now you have a 4/3 on turn two
2014-08-25 12:20:44	@mancat	with trample and B: regen
2014-08-25 12:20:47	@relsqui	^
2014-08-25 12:21:14	@mancat	but yeah, in my de3ck you cast troll, pitcha ll the eidolons, then cast a multicolored spell
2014-08-25 12:21:18	@mancat	rinse, repeat
2014-08-25 12:21:37	@mancat	it plays a lot of 2-drop multicolored instands and sorceries
2014-08-25 12:22:57	@relsqui	anyway, yeah
2014-08-25 12:23:01	@relsqui	fortheswarm
2014-08-25 12:23:03	 *	relsqui gets dressed
2014-08-25 12:23:11	aliaras	mancat: nice
2014-08-25 12:23:14	aliaras	really nice.
2014-08-25 12:24:49	@relsqui	mancat: I've had Criminal stuck in my head all morning
2014-08-25 12:25:07	@relsqui	I don't need anything from you, I'm just telling you to get it stuck in YOUR head
2014-08-25 12:25:28	@mancat	lol thanks
2014-08-25 12:25:43	@relsqui	you're welcome!
2014-08-25 12:25:47	@mancat	aliaras: it's like one good interaction in a deck that plsy 20 really shitty cards :P
2014-08-25 12:25:51	@mancat	but it's fun when it goes off
2014-08-25 12:26:21	@relsqui	I know that feel v_v
2014-08-25 12:26:36	aliaras	:D
2014-08-25 12:31:57	@relsqui	aliaras: so there are these psychographic profiles describing the various ways/reasons different people enjoy magic
2014-08-25 12:32:06	aliaras	yeah, don't think I've heard that one
2014-08-25 12:32:10	@relsqui	oh okay
2014-08-25 12:32:23	@relsqui	lemme make sure I haven't misremembered which one I mean before relaying it
2014-08-25 12:32:30	aliaras	familiar with Timmy, Johnny, Spike
2014-08-25 12:32:51	@relsqui	so there are two others which aren't really technically psychographics but go along a different axis
2014-08-25 12:33:11	@relsqui	melvins really like intricate rules interactions
2014-08-25 12:33:16	@relsqui	and cool mechanics
2014-08-25 12:33:26	@relsqui	vorthoses are super into lore and story
2014-08-25 12:33:40	 *	aliaras nodnodnod
2014-08-25 12:33:41	@relsqui	these are traditionally set opposed to one another, which is silly. I like both a lot.
2014-08-25 12:33:48	aliaras	makes sense :)
2014-08-25 12:34:02	@relsqui	yus
2014-08-25 13:34:58	@relsqui	mancat: oh, I meant to mention. silly moments while picking over cards for black storm
2014-08-25 13:35:31	@relsqui	"so I need a bunch of draw and I don't want to have to spend a bunch of my carefully-ritualed mana to do it ... what I need is a way to trade life for cards"
2014-08-25 13:35:35	@relsqui	if ... if only there were a way to do that
2014-08-25 13:35:36	@relsqui	in black
2014-08-25 13:35:53	@relsqui	perhaps something that would let me arbitrarily trade quantities of life for card draw
2014-08-25 13:36:08	@relsqui	(I'm not proxying that either but the realization was illuminating)
2014-08-25 13:36:56	@mancat	...yeah there's a reason those cards are abnned :P
2014-08-25 13:37:01	@mancat	*banned
2014-08-25 13:37:20	 *	relsqui grins
2014-08-25 13:37:55	@relsqui	I had the big one in mind, what else were you thinking of?
2014-08-25 13:39:04	@relsqui	I guess I could look it up
2014-08-25 14:37:21	Golem	Hmm.  I has a thought.  Garruk is a plansewalker hunter.  Nicol bolas is (arguably) the strongest walker.
2014-08-25 14:37:30	Golem	KING KONG VS GODZILLA
2014-08-25 14:44:14	@relsqui	would watch
2014-08-25 15:30:51	@relsqui	> Thank you for registering for Party in the Park 2014. Your group’s table request has been approved!
2014-08-25 15:30:55	@relsqui	\m/
2014-08-25 15:32:00	@dom	\m/
2014-08-25 15:33:09	@relsqui	so we'll need people for check-in and setup at 10am on october 2, and then some quantity of people around from 11-3
2014-08-25 15:36:33	@relsqui	and to do some planning before then
2014-08-25 16:19:35	@dom	did people read the MaRo article?
2014-08-25 16:19:46	@dom	does not really live up to the hype IMO
2014-08-25 16:26:01	 *	relsqui shrugs
2014-08-25 16:26:12	@relsqui	it's a pretty big change, more so for people who have been playing longer than we have
2014-08-25 16:26:16	@relsqui	I think it's cool
2014-08-25 16:26:23	aliaras	I am skeptical and apprehensive :P
2014-08-25 16:26:33	@relsqui	I'm excited, but not as much as maro is
2014-08-25 16:26:49	aliaras	also I am playing uB control and I'll see how this goes >_>
2014-08-25 16:27:02	@relsqui	I should build this tendrils deck if I'm going to be sitting around the cat uselessly
2014-08-25 16:27:10	aliaras	tendrils deck? :D
2014-08-25 16:27:26	@relsqui	!card tendrils of agony
2014-08-25 16:27:28	oracle	Sorcery, 2BB (4)
2014-08-25 16:27:28	oracle	Target player loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
2014-08-25 16:27:28	oracle	Storm (When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn. You may choose new targets for the copies.)
2014-08-25 16:27:31	aliaras	oooh
2014-08-25 16:27:58	aliaras	this deck: would be 1000x more baller if I hadn't passed Evolving Wilds
2014-08-25 16:28:08	aliaras	then I would have Hornet's Nest and be way less nervous about my few UU cards
2014-08-25 16:28:38	aliaras	have hornet's nest, bonk with Cruel Sadist, churn out a token deathtoucher every other turn
2014-08-25 16:29:25	@relsqui	hehehe
2014-08-25 16:31:31	aliaras	right?!?
2014-08-25 16:31:56	aliaras	I can see what I picked over it and see whether I still agree with my past self, but the answer is "probably not"
2014-08-25 16:34:43	@relsqui	I'm still pretty into the chord -> hornet play we were talking about a few days ago
2014-08-25 16:35:04	@relsqui	flash in nest, chump, make like forty bees, look smug
2014-08-25 17:08:28	aliaras	whoa
2014-08-25 17:08:29	aliaras	nice
2014-08-25 17:08:30	aliaras	that
2014-08-25 17:08:31	aliaras	*nice*
2014-08-25 17:08:44	aliaras	so I'm afraid I may have made mistakes about who precisely was beatdown there
2014-08-25 17:09:08	aliaras	because I could have tried to trade more aggressively maybe?
2014-08-25 17:19:16	aliaras	cruel sadist on a goblin rabblemaster: VALUE
2014-08-25 17:55:42	aliaras	okay so this deck has let me down somewhat
2014-08-25 17:56:00	aliaras	but I'm still having fun and clutch counterspells are amazing
2014-08-25 18:48:51	@relsqui	mancat: >_> I should stop popping up and asking you things
2014-08-25 18:48:57	 *	relsqui has storm questions but can just try it and see
2014-08-25 18:49:46	@dom	i dont know why the challenge was for you to not use creatures
2014-08-25 18:50:40	@dom	you wahave way more spell decks than creatue decks
2014-08-25 18:50:59	@dom	in other news, my laptop has shit wifi in my dorm room. Who knew?
2014-08-25 18:51:11	@dom	brb going to meet guy
2014-08-25 18:51:20	@relsqui	dom: yeah that's what I said too
2014-08-25 18:51:25	@relsqui	but mancat thinks I use too many creatures
2014-08-25 18:51:32	@relsqui	CLEARLY he wants me playing more pure burn >_>
2014-08-25 18:53:20	@relsqui	first deck of this draft is out of balance
2014-08-25 18:53:22	@relsqui	need more draw
2014-08-25 18:53:24	@relsqui	less land
2014-08-25 18:54:21	 *	relsqui tinkers
2014-08-25 19:11:07	@mancat	what i actually intended is that you try a technical control deck :P
2014-08-25 19:11:20	@mancat	but if you wanna play storm i won't stop you
2014-08-25 19:13:52	@relsqui	XD
2014-08-25 19:13:59	@relsqui	I mean, that sounds more interesting and more useful
2014-08-25 19:14:02	 *	relsqui has abandoned this one.
2014-08-25 19:14:10	@relsqui	but I'm not sure I know how to build it.
2014-08-25 19:15:49	@relsqui	what actually happened is like "I have nfi where to start. gatherer, pls to tell me highest-rated bw noncreature cards"
2014-08-25 19:15:56	@relsqui	and gatherer is like HEY BRO HAVE YOU HEARD OF NECROPOTENCE
2014-08-25 19:22:19	@relsqui	which in retrospect I should have predicted. white is rl good at creatures, so if you take creatures out of bw you end up with a lot of black
2014-08-25 19:40:54	@relsqui	hahaha http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/post/95783942739/will-you-please-confirm-that-every-other-block-will-now
2014-08-25 19:41:02	@relsqui	"will now be return to ravnica" is the end of the question >_>
2014-08-25 19:41:06	@relsqui	> I like factionalized multicolor sets with good mana-fixing, too. You might be interested in this thing that's coming out soon, Khans of Tarkir... :)

2014-08-25 20:34:08	@relsqui	!card pyromancer ascension

2014-08-25 20:34:09	oracle	Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has the same name as a card in your graveyard, you may put a quest counter on Pyromancer Ascension.
2014-08-25 20:34:09	oracle	Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell while Pyromancer Ascension has two or more quest counters on it, you may copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
2014-08-25 20:34:27	@relsqui	aliaras: ^ here's your challenge from me and mancat.
2014-08-25 20:34:39	@relsqui	I dunno if we wanna put any more specific constraints on it
2014-08-25 20:34:44	@relsqui	other than "build the deck that makes that gO"
2014-08-25 20:57:04	@mancat	!card lightning bolt

2014-08-25 21:50:18	@relsqui	why is this good !card zuran orb
2014-08-25 21:50:18	oracle	Artifact, 0
2014-08-25 21:50:18	oracle	Sacrifice a land: You gain 2 life.
2014-08-25 21:50:23	@relsqui	I mean, clearly it's useful
2014-08-25 21:50:29	@relsqui	but it's extremely highly rated and I don't know why
2014-08-25 22:51:41	Golem	Fun stuff I discover when I play silly decks
2014-08-25 22:52:06	Golem	Dont respond to the polukranos ability trigger, respond to the monstrous ability itself
2014-08-25 22:52:47	Golem	otherwise your opponent will do what I did, and after seing you make all your dudes indestructable with boros charm, will instead just direct all 9 damage at his own hornet's nest
2014-08-25 22:53:36	Golem	Although Looking at it, I couldent actually do that
2014-08-25 22:53:37	Golem	HMM
2014-08-25 22:53:42	Golem	didnt catch that at the time
2014-08-26 00:04:44	@relsqui	what does it mean to respond to the ability trigger and not the ability?
2014-08-26 01:36:37	@relsqui	oh, that was really confusing. I misread beseech the queen's mana cost as being phyrexian. in retrospect I don't know how
2014-08-26 01:36:45	@relsqui	I just saw two of something or one black and didn't think about it too hard
2014-08-26 01:37:02	@relsqui	and got annoyed at forge >_> sorry forge
2014-08-26 06:57:06	aliaras	relsqui: eeeeenteresting :)
2014-08-26 06:57:09	aliaras	thanks

2014-08-26 09:19:54	@relsqui	also, I think the reason I'm not worried that the thing for beginners will be some babying thing is that the previous one is *the core set*
2014-08-26 09:36:49	@relsqui	oh hey. need to remember to leave at least the cube with someone that's not me or andy today
2014-08-26 09:36:57	@relsqui	since we're both planning to be out of town next week
2014-08-26 11:39:11	aliaras	18:38 <@relsqui> way better than, for example, the tutor computer
2014-08-26 11:39:17	aliaras	relsqui: I'm having your problem with magic words v.v
2014-08-26 11:39:29	@relsqui	XD
2014-08-26 11:39:32	@relsqui	eeeexcellent
2014-08-26 11:39:41	 *	relsqui searches library for a computer
2014-08-26 11:40:10	aliaras	actually I had this problem really bad with race for the galaxy
2014-08-26 11:40:16	aliaras	where you start with 6 cards and discard 2
2014-08-26 11:40:25	aliaras	and I instead looked at my cards and went "notbad, I'll keep."
2014-08-26 11:41:03	@relsqui	lololol
2014-08-26 11:41:14	@relsqui	see also cribbage

2014-08-26 11:41:30	@relsqui	thanks, coffee
2014-08-26 11:41:36	 *	relsqui got like five hours of sleep for no particular reason
2014-08-26 11:42:54	aliaras	hee
2014-08-26 11:42:59	 *	aliaras got 8 but they ended at 7am
2014-08-26 11:43:29	@relsqui	that's pretty legit
2014-08-26 11:43:41	aliaras	yeash
2014-08-26 11:43:45	aliaras	still a bit tired tho
2014-08-26 11:44:20	aliaras	also not sure how to think about my draft last night. was running a worse deck than I could have been, went 2-1 anyways
2014-08-26 11:44:38	aliaras	because of one bad connection (timeout) and one opponent who, at 1-1, should have had a better deck than the one I saw
2014-08-26 11:46:13	aliaras	so I suspect they did not draw very well
2014-08-26 11:54:54	@dom	11 of my current windows' 15 tabs are magiccards.info
2014-08-26 11:57:05	@relsqui	lol, that was me yesterday. what are you working on?
2014-08-26 12:06:21	@dom	nothing, thats just normal everyday usage
2014-08-26 12:06:39	@dom	I dont wanna forget about a card I looked up cuz i wanna use it
2014-08-26 12:06:43	@dom	so I open a new tab
2014-08-26 12:24:10	@relsqui	ah
2014-08-26 12:24:20	@relsqui	I do that to a point and then dump it in a brainstorm file in deckstats or deckbox
2014-08-26 12:24:40	@relsqui	pretty much to avoid that
2014-08-26 12:24:44	@relsqui	or I just build the deck >_>

2014-08-26 18:26:46	-->	Nucleosynth (sid38853@id-38853.ealing.irccloud.com) has joined #mtg
2014-08-26 18:27:29	aliaras	Okay so I am teaching Nucleosynth mtg ( Nucleosynth: also minimaxzed from otherchannel waybackwhen)
2014-08-26 18:27:45	aliaras	relsqui: and we are stuck on a rules question: how does regenerate interact with first strike?
2014-08-26 18:27:56	aliaras	Like say, hypothetically, he played !card Vampire Warlord
2014-08-26 18:27:59	oracle	Creature — Vampire Warrior 4/2, 4B (5)
2014-08-26 18:27:59	oracle	Sacrifice another creature: Regenerate Vampire Warlord. (The next time this creature would be destroyed this turn, it isn't. Instead tap it, remove all damage from it, and remove it from combat.)
2014-08-26 18:28:14	aliaras	and I have two first-striking 1/1 slivers
2014-08-26 18:28:43	aliaras	So if he attacks and I block: do my slivers die?
2014-08-26 18:53:06	aliaras	Also: sacrifice: does it count as dying?
2014-08-26 18:53:14	aliaras	Nucleosynth just used a !card Corpse Hauler
2014-08-26 18:53:14	oracle	Creature — Human Rogue 2/1, 1B (2)
2014-08-26 18:53:14	oracle	{2}{B}, Sacrifice Corpse Hauler: Return another target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
2014-08-26 18:53:30	aliaras	with this guy on the board: !card Xathrid Necromancer
2014-08-26 18:53:30	oracle	Creature — Human Wizard 2/2, 2B (3)
2014-08-26 18:53:30	oracle	Whenever Xathrid Necromancer or another Human creature you control dies, put a 2/2 black Zombie creature token onto the battlefield tapped.
2014-08-26 19:04:45	aliaras	AND ANOTHER QUESTION
2014-08-26 19:05:18	aliaras	I have !card Young Pyromancer
2014-08-26 19:05:18	oracle	Creature — Human Shaman 2/1, 1R (2)
2014-08-26 19:05:18	oracle	Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, put a 1/1 red Elemental creature token onto the battlefield.
2014-08-26 19:05:37	aliaras	I cast Chandra's Outrage (red instant) which is countered by my goddamn motherfucker of an opponent playing blue
2014-08-26 19:05:42	aliaras	( Nucleosynth: <3 )
2014-08-26 19:05:59	Nucleosynth	:3
2014-08-26 19:06:01	aliaras	do I get a 1/1 token?
2014-08-26 20:46:05	<--	Corax (~justinm@131.252.211.196) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2014-08-26 21:24:36	@relsqui	aliaras: one sec, lemme catch up
2014-08-26 21:24:44	@relsqui	aliaras: but before I read the whole interaction, a regenerating creature is tapped and removed from combat
2014-08-26 21:24:59	@relsqui	aliaras: so if that answers your question cool, if not one sec while I catch up
2014-08-26 21:25:24	@relsqui	oh you saw that already in reminder text k
2014-08-26 21:25:48	@relsqui	no your slivers don't die, sacrificing usually counts as "dying" depending on why you're asking
2014-08-26 21:25:58	@relsqui	for the purpose of, like, "when this creature dies" yes
2014-08-26 21:26:07	@relsqui	for the purpose of being able to regenerate no
2014-08-26 21:26:26	@relsqui	so yes, Nucleosynth gets a zombie for saccing corpse hauler
2014-08-26 21:28:03	@relsqui	aliaras: and finally yes, you get an elemental
2014-08-26 21:28:13	@relsqui	the spell becomes "cast" when you put it on the stack, after you announce it and pay for it
2014-08-26 21:28:20	@relsqui	at which point it becomes a legal target for counterspell
2014-08-26 21:28:23	@relsqui	so it never resolves, but you did cast it
2014-08-26 21:37:56	aliaras	oh, cool
2014-08-26 21:38:03	@relsqui	mancat: hey
2014-08-26 21:38:03	aliaras	last question: does !card Hive Stirrings
2014-08-26 21:38:04	@relsqui	hey mancat
2014-08-26 21:38:04	oracle	Sorcery, 2W (3)
2014-08-26 21:38:04	oracle	Put two 1/1 colorless Sliver creature tokens onto the battlefield.
2014-08-26 21:38:04	@relsqui	hey

2014-08-26 21:38:27	@relsqui	^____^

2014-08-26 21:38:39	@relsqui	^_^
2014-08-26 21:38:43	 *	relsqui not done making that face yet, lol
2014-08-26 21:38:57	aliaras	relsqui: does Hive Stirrings trigger !card Door of Destinies
2014-08-26 21:38:57	oracle	Artifact, 4 (4)
2014-08-26 21:38:57	oracle	As Door of Destinies enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
2014-08-26 21:38:57	oracle	Whenever you cast a spell of the chosen type, put a charge counter on Door of Destinies.
2014-08-26 21:38:57	oracle	Creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1 for each charge counter on Door of Destinies.
2014-08-26 21:39:04	aliaras	where the type is Sliver?
2014-08-26 21:39:20	@relsqui	aliaras: nope. types are anything that's in the type line of the card, between the art and the rules text
2014-08-26 21:39:24	@relsqui	the only type of that spell is Sorcery
2014-08-26 21:39:31	@relsqui	you didn't cast the tokens, you just put them into play
2014-08-26 21:39:37	@relsqui	(and, relatedly, they're not spells)
2014-08-26 21:40:03	 *	aliaras nods
2014-08-26 21:40:11	aliaras	but * Sliver would trigger it
2014-08-26 21:40:15	@relsqui	yah
2014-08-26 21:40:19	aliaras	cool
2014-08-26 21:40:32	@relsqui	umm
2014-08-26 21:40:52	@relsqui	!card bitterblossom
2014-08-26 21:40:52	oracle	Tribal Enchantment — Faerie, 1B (2)
2014-08-26 21:40:52	oracle	At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life and put a 1/1 black Faerie Rogue creature token with flying onto the battlefield.
2014-08-26 21:40:58	@relsqui	^ here's a noncreature that could trigger door
2014-08-26 21:41:12	@mancat	Tribal... worst type ever
2014-08-26 21:41:15	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-26 21:41:21	@relsqui	itym worst supertype
2014-08-26 21:41:22	@relsqui	>_>
2014-08-26 21:41:28	@mancat	nope
2014-08-26 21:41:29	@mancat	worst type
2014-08-26 21:41:33	@mancat	that's exactly my point
2014-08-26 21:41:35	@relsqui	oh, right
2014-08-26 21:41:35	@mancat	it should be a supertype
2014-08-26 21:41:38	@relsqui	I forgot about that
2014-08-26 21:41:43	@mancat	because a card that's *just* a tribal makes no damn sense
2014-08-26 21:41:43	@relsqui	I remembered it was weird, I forgot which direction
2014-08-26 21:41:56	@mancat	the reason it's not a supertype is that supertypes can't have subtypes
2014-08-26 21:41:59	@mancat	apropos of nothing
2014-08-26 21:42:00	@relsqui	yeah, iirc it's like that because you can't have .... multiple supertypes with the same subtypes, or something
2014-08-26 21:42:03	@relsqui	it's something weird like that
2014-08-26 21:42:03	@relsqui	ah, yeah
2014-08-26 21:42:33	@relsqui	argh I continue to want a hard copy of the comp rules
2014-08-26 21:42:36	@relsqui	for when I'm like
2014-08-26 21:42:38	@mancat	there's basically no reason to keep that a strict rule, they should have changed that and make Tribal a supertype
2014-08-26 21:42:40	@relsqui	"what are the supertypes again"
2014-08-26 21:42:41	@mancat	it makes way more sense that way
2014-08-26 21:42:41	aliaras	haha
2014-08-26 21:42:48	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-26 21:42:50	@relsqui	world and .......

2014-08-26 21:43:19	@relsqui	I like being in the middle of rules questions

2014-08-26 21:43:27	@relsqui	and I answer if I can and if not I poke you and Golem
2014-08-26 21:43:39	aliaras	relsqui: :D
2014-08-26 21:43:43	aliaras	this is part of why I ask you
2014-08-26 21:43:52	@relsqui	mancat: there are two more
2014-08-26 21:43:57	@mancat	are there?

2014-08-26 23:49:08	@relsqui	^ isn't that another scheme card name? :P
2014-08-27 08:00:23	-->	Corax (justinm@stargate.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #mtg
2014-08-27 13:14:44	@relsqui	okay, submitted design request to the graphic design center
2014-08-27 13:22:36	@relsqui	not sure whether regretting adding all the magic tumblrs to mah rss
2014-08-27 13:22:47	@relsqui	"why does jar of eyeballs get two counters from a cyclops??"
2014-08-27 13:30:58	aliaras	hahaha
2014-08-27 13:31:30	aliaras	hey relsqui, is there such a thing as like, cube sealed?
2014-08-27 13:31:39	@relsqui	there is such a thing as cube whatever you want :P
2014-08-27 13:31:44	@relsqui	it's a cube! that's the point ^_^
2014-08-27 13:32:02	aliaras	haha okay
2014-08-27 13:32:06	aliaras	what makes a cube a cube?
2014-08-27 13:32:21	aliaras	(inb4 'well it has six sides...')
2014-08-27 13:32:24	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-27 13:32:42	@relsqui	I'm not sure it has any definition beyond a large (at least a few hundred) set of hand-picked cards for playing games with
2014-08-27 13:32:49	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-27 13:32:51	 *	relsqui looks it up
2014-08-27 13:32:53	aliaras	How would one hand-pick the cards?
2014-08-27 13:33:06	 *	aliaras is contemplating turning the little m14 stack into a noob cube
2014-08-27 13:33:13	aliaras	which it effectively is, but it's small :P
2014-08-27 13:33:26	@relsqui	you mean "how make good cube"? that's more of a mancat question
2014-08-27 13:33:42	@relsqui	http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Cube#Cube_Draft
2014-08-27 13:33:51	@relsqui	has a little information
2014-08-27 13:33:51	aliaras	Yeah
2014-08-27 13:33:55	@relsqui	you *can* do whatever you want
2014-08-27 13:34:05	@relsqui	it's probably a good idea to balance it for colors and power unless you're specifically doing osmething else
2014-08-27 13:34:40	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-27 13:34:48	aliaras	yeah it's hard to know what counts there
2014-08-27 13:35:15	@relsqui	counts?
2014-08-27 13:35:35	@relsqui	mancat: oh, the ridiculous format we couldn't remember the name of last night is grand melee, apparently
2014-08-27 13:35:37	aliaras	How to make sure it is balanced and not just on # of cards
2014-08-27 13:35:48	@relsqui	ah, yeah
2014-08-27 14:14:26	@relsqui	mancat: also, I found the place where/how to email wizards re: support as a university club, and I can't for the life of me word this message
2014-08-27 14:14:29	@relsqui	would appreciate help
2014-08-27 14:21:55	aliaras	relsqui: want me to take a look at it?
2014-08-27 14:22:06	@relsqui	I don't think you've understood :P
2014-08-27 14:22:08	@relsqui	there is nothing to look at.
2014-08-27 14:22:12	aliaras	haha okay
2014-08-27 14:22:44	@relsqui	but if you wanna toss out wordings for basically "hey we're not a store but we do teaching and outreach, do you want to give us stuff?" go for it
2014-08-27 14:24:08	@relsqui	useful data points include we're going to be tabling on campus soon, and having sample decks would be neat >_> but wanna be open to other things
2014-08-27 14:27:45	aliaras	My first guess: Hi, \n\n I'm the head of the Portland State University Magic club. [Over the past year, we've grown by $amount, and we're continually bringing new people in to and getting them into the game]. While we're not ourselves a store, we run events every [frequency], and attendance [has been growing]. \n \n [[Requesting parts go here]]
2014-08-27 14:28:05	aliaras	oh I was gonna put something in about your relationship with your LGS
2014-08-27 14:28:09	aliaras	in p1
2014-08-27 14:28:34	@relsqui	I think we're aiming less formal than that, it's just a customer support message
2014-08-27 14:28:40	@relsqui	so it's not like I have A Human to talk at
2014-08-27 14:28:46	aliaras	Well, A Human will read it
2014-08-27 14:28:49	@relsqui	well, yes
2014-08-27 14:28:56	@relsqui	but that human won't be someone I'm on "trying to impress you" terms with
2014-08-27 14:29:25	@relsqui	so I was thinking more like "here's my situation, is this a thing you guys do/want to do?"
2014-08-27 14:29:31	 *	aliaras nods
2014-08-27 14:29:40	@relsqui	really just "is it a thing you guys do" because I'm sure there's some policy for this
2014-08-27 14:31:22	aliaras	Yeah that was going to be my p2-- "Do you have anything you do to support groups like mine? We would be interested in working with you all in order to run more awesome events for more people. For example, we're tabling soon, and it'd be really useful to have sample decks to show off how the game works."
2014-08-27 14:31:32	 *	relsqui nods thoughtfully
2014-08-27 14:31:39	aliaras	but the para1 is so whoever reads it is like "damn, these guys are awesome"
2014-08-27 14:31:54	@relsqui	adding thing about LGS is good, also wanted to ask "are we able to run sanctioned events as a non-store? would we need to/can we partner with our LGS to do this?"
2014-08-27 14:31:56	aliaras	and because...it's just nicer to read. It's a bit of background/context
2014-08-27 14:32:01	aliaras	That's a really good question.
2014-08-27 14:32:11	@relsqui	aliaras: background/context yes, but this isn't a sales pitch and I don't want it to sound lik eone
2014-08-27 14:32:15	 *	aliaras nods
2014-08-27 14:33:09	aliaras	Yeah, then loosen my thing up a bit maybe, but is still good to have an intro
2014-08-27 14:33:10	@relsqui	also, "length of time we've been around" is a no-go because that's like six months, lol
2014-08-27 14:33:13	@relsqui	sure
2014-08-27 14:33:15	aliaras	haha 's fine
2014-08-27 14:33:19	@relsqui	that's the "here's our sitch" part
2014-08-27 14:33:28	aliaras	was just thinking of what kinds of things you'd say to someone if they're like "hey, what do you do?"
2014-08-27 14:33:30	@relsqui	right
2014-08-27 14:33:36	aliaras	and you wanna sound baller because you are :P
2014-08-27 14:34:43	@relsqui	eh, I mean, kinda, but again -- I don't need to impress anyone, I really doubt this is going to be a situation of an individual deciding "well, maybe we can do this thing for them if they're cool enough"
2014-08-27 14:34:55	@relsqui	I'm assuming they have some policy about supporting non-store orgs
2014-08-27 14:34:59	aliaras	yeah probably
2014-08-27 14:35:06	aliaras	so like, I'm A Human, right
2014-08-27 14:35:20	@relsqui	so I just wanna illustrate that's what we are, and it would apply to us, and find out about it
2014-08-27 14:35:55	aliaras	Could also go more with a similar kind of approach to asking programming questions
2014-08-27 14:36:09	@relsqui	"I've already looked into x and y, the part I don't know is z"?
2014-08-27 14:36:12	aliaras	"Hi I am so and so and I have looked here here and here and did not find one, so I'm asking you"
2014-08-27 14:36:15	aliaras	yep
2014-08-27 14:36:35	@relsqui	oop gotta run and bus, bbiab
2014-08-27 14:36:45	aliaras	mostly when I see things in the queue that are just question i am like 'wut'
2014-08-27 21:10:00	@relsqui	lol. "you said jitm was a 10 on the storm scale. why has the powere level of standard been lowered that far??" ".... jitm was never not too OP for standard"
2014-08-27 21:15:21	Nucleosynth	so I've only been using the MTGO interface for maybe 10 minutes, but 1) omg who designed this UI  2) did they really really like using debuggers
2014-08-27 21:16:06	aliaras	relsqui: hahaha source?
2014-08-27 21:16:29	@relsqui	aliaras: blogatog
2014-08-27 21:18:43	aliaras	also what's the 'storm scale'?
2014-08-27 21:22:25	aliaras	okay so who is Emrakul, the Aeons Torn?
2014-08-27 21:22:27	aliaras	lorewise I mean :P
2014-08-27 21:22:56	@relsqui	the storm scale is "on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being storm, how likely is x to be reprinted"
2014-08-27 21:23:02	aliaras	ahhhhhh
2014-08-27 21:23:03	@relsqui	I forget if it's "reprinted in standard"
2014-08-27 21:23:04	@relsqui	I think so
2014-08-27 21:23:11	@relsqui	so, like, 1 is basic lands
2014-08-27 21:23:14	@relsqui	10 is storm
2014-08-27 21:23:20	aliaras	lol
2014-08-27 21:23:39	Nucleosynth	aliaras: Emrakul appears to be "a tremendous badass who is not to be trifled with" afaict
2014-08-27 21:23:59	@relsqui	I haven't done the eldrazi wikiwalk yet :( so I can't tell you much about emrakul
2014-08-27 21:30:39	Nucleosynth	so I got !card Vorinclex in this Momir game and it is making things very very silly
2014-08-27 21:30:40	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-08-27 21:31:01	@relsqui	!card vorinclex

2014-08-27 21:31:11	 *	relsqui looks it up
2014-08-27 21:31:12	aliaras	awwwwwww oracle
2014-08-27 21:31:15	Nucleosynth	haha ahww
2014-08-27 21:31:23	@relsqui	aliaras: you've seen its source, right?

2014-08-27 21:32:19	aliaras	nah
2014-08-27 21:32:27	Nucleosynth	I am impressed
2014-08-27 21:32:52	@relsqui	right?
2014-08-27 21:33:01	@relsqui	like, it's completely insane as a way to implement it
2014-08-27 21:33:16	@relsqui	and it makes you appreciate more that it works even as much as it does 8)
2014-08-27 21:33:49	@relsqui	(mancat++ <3 :P)
2014-08-27 21:40:40	Nucleosynth	http://i.imgur.com/fNOcFCB.png   #momirproblems
2014-08-27 21:41:00	aliaras	relsqui btw you should come out and visit again because I have calculated that if you do there will be enough people to draft with >_>
2014-08-27 21:41:14	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-27 21:42:08	@relsqui	I like how you say calculated as if you don't mean literally counting
2014-08-27 21:42:13	@relsqui	how many are you considering enough?
2014-08-27 21:42:21	aliaras	I was looking for a full set, so 8
2014-08-27 21:42:28	aliaras	can get 4 in various combinations
2014-08-27 21:43:15	aliaras	easily
2014-08-27 21:48:23	<--	Nucleosynth (sid38853@id-38853.ealing.irccloud.com) has quit (Quit: Updating details, brb)
2014-08-27 21:48:25	-->	nucleosynth (sid38853@id-38853.ealing.irccloud.com) has joined #mtg
2014-08-27 22:46:09	stormcrow	aliaras: Emrakul, the Aeons Torn is one of the three Eldrazi titans, which are plane-eating cosmic monstrosities that live in the Blind Eternities (the non-reality that exists between planes). Think of Emrakul as being C'thulhu-like, and you're on the right track.
2014-08-27 22:46:47	@relsqui	stormcrow++ thanks!
2014-08-27 22:47:21	@relsqui	the eldrazi basically go around eating planes, yeah?
2014-08-27 22:47:35	@relsqui	until I-forget-which-walkers trapped them on zendikar in the hedrons
2014-08-27 22:47:49	stormcrow	The Eldrazi were held in place by a big spell from Sorin Markov, Ugin the Spirit Dragon, and a third planeswalker we don't know yet. Jace, Chandra, and Sarkhan Vol opened the lock, and Nissa broke the lock when Sorin came to investigate.
2014-08-27 22:48:08	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-27 22:48:22	stormcrow	The Eldrazi escaped and immediately began eating Zendikar
2014-08-27 22:48:43	@relsqui	(hedrons are ... what their name suggests they should be. big rocky shape things. if you pull up images of lands from zendikar block you'll see them)
2014-08-27 22:51:27	stormcrow	The hedrons were (apparently) also used to keep Ob Nixilis powerless and trapped on Zendikar, and dulled the curse that Liliana put on Garruk.
2014-08-27 22:52:35	@relsqui	they're pretty rad rocks
2014-08-27 22:56:51	@relsqui	okay! shot off that support email to wizards, finally
2014-08-27 22:57:52	@relsqui	saying basically a) is there a way for us to get sample decks from you/do you do any other kinds of support for non-store orgs, and b) are we able to run a tournament without being a retailer, and if not, what would we need from our flgs to partner with them
2014-08-27 22:58:19	@relsqui	and when they get back to me I can talk to tv folks
2014-08-27 23:19:02	@relsqui	DERP I just realized I can't be around for all of party in the park, I have a class to go to :P lol
2014-08-27 23:19:09	@relsqui	but I'll be there for the first part
2014-08-28 12:40:00	aliaras	so !card Might Makes Right
2014-08-28 12:40:00	oracle	Enchantment, 5R (6)
2014-08-28 12:40:00	oracle	At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control each creature on the battlefield with the greatest power, gain control of target creature an opponent controls until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn. (It can attack and {T} this turn.)
2014-08-28 12:40:03	aliaras	the ultimate win-more card?
2014-08-28 12:43:23	@relsqui	I don't think it's necessarily win-more
2014-08-28 12:43:45	@relsqui	because just having the biggest critter doesn't mean you're winning :P
2014-08-28 12:43:50	@relsqui	emrakul dies to fifteen squirrels
2014-08-28 12:43:55	aliaras	it's true
2014-08-28 14:46:36	@mancat	only in bizarre edge cases :P
2014-08-28 14:52:45	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-28 14:52:53	@relsqui	my point stands
2014-08-28 14:52:58	@relsqui	and that mental picture is too good to pass up
2014-08-28 15:13:43	@relsqui	oh hey reply from wizards
2014-08-28 15:13:59	@relsqui	they don't support sanctioned events from non-stores, so we'll want to talk to TV about that
2014-08-28 15:14:10	@relsqui	but they will send us some sample decks if we tell them where to :)
2014-08-28 15:14:16	@relsqui	I wonder if we can receive a package here
2014-08-28 15:14:17	aliaras	oh sweet :)
2014-08-28 15:31:17	@relsqui	aliaras, mancat: we can totally put four generations of magic players in one place
2014-08-28 15:31:19	@relsqui	next weekend
2014-08-28 15:31:23	@relsqui	I am in favor of this happening if possible.
2014-08-28 15:31:37	aliaras	er
2014-08-28 15:31:39	aliaras	?
2014-08-28 15:32:00	@relsqui	aliaras: he's been wanting to introduce me to the person who taught *him*
2014-08-28 15:32:02	@relsqui	or got him back into it, anyway
2014-08-28 15:32:05	aliaras	hahahaha
2014-08-28 15:32:07	@relsqui	which is a thing we can do in sj
2014-08-28 15:32:19	@relsqui	"hey, meet your magic grandkid!"
2014-08-28 15:32:27	@relsqui	and I pointed out after you were here that that's what you are to him :)
2014-08-28 15:33:26	aliaras	heee
2014-08-28 15:33:41	@relsqui	yes, exactly
2014-08-28 16:13:59	@relsqui	this is interesting http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/growing-fantasy-game-universe-collides-with-entrenched-boys-club-mentality/2014/08/26/3745c1fa-2971-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html

2014-08-28 16:14:59	aliaras	oooh thanks
2014-08-28 16:15:21	@relsqui	don't read the comments, obviously
2014-08-28 16:17:43	nightfly	reading the comments is almost always a bad idea -_-
2014-08-28 16:18:17	@relsqui	yeah.
2014-08-28 16:18:41	@relsqui	I forget whose law it is that the comments in any online article about feminism are why we need feminism
2014-08-28 16:18:59	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-28 16:19:01	aliaras	true though
2014-08-28 17:24:45	aliaras	relsqui: good article, thanks :)
2014-08-28 17:25:25	aliaras	also man every time I play red I get https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0BDS0-ZwOw stuck in my head
2014-08-28 17:30:44	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-28 17:56:19	aliaras	i,i "what if this Storm ends"
2014-08-28 17:57:47	@relsqui	XD
2014-08-28 21:15:19	@relsqui	"is Matt Tabak too strong for standard" ahahaha
2014-08-28 21:16:00	@relsqui	aliaras, Golem: http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/96058706578/youve-mentioned-that-yall-have-a-new-beginner-product

2014-08-28 21:16:07	@relsqui	tl;dr "yes, the new beginner product will be standard-legal"
2014-08-28 21:17:54	@relsqui	"we fucked that up in portal and learned better"
2014-08-28 21:24:56	stormcrow	Oh, man, Portal. I think that's where I originally learned how to play magic
2014-08-28 21:25:02	Golem	lol
2014-08-28 21:25:05	Golem	ah portal
2014-08-28 21:25:09	Golem	that was an awful set
2014-08-28 21:25:11	stormcrow	This was...long ago
2014-08-28 21:25:33	Golem	It holds a fond place in my heart, if only because long ago someone gave me a lot of portal cards
2014-08-28 21:25:45	@relsqui	hehe
2014-08-28 21:25:58	stormcrow	I think my age was in single digits? Crap, what years were those around, anyway?
2014-08-28 21:26:05	@relsqui	anyway yeah, I think basically having it be a separate product was sufficiently obviously a bad idea
2014-08-28 21:26:32	@relsqui	UGH
2014-08-28 21:26:33	@relsqui	> houstofcards said: I wasn't able to find a place to voice my opinion for the "favorite clan shirt" voting . Where can I send my Abzan-tee ballot?
2014-08-28 21:26:34	Golem	LEARNING!
2014-08-28 21:26:50	Golem	Good, Not repeating mistakes is an important skill to develop in life and mtg
2014-08-28 21:26:52	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-28 21:27:13	Golem	Also that pun hurts me
2014-08-28 21:27:18	Golem	it hurts me right in my heart place
2014-08-28 21:27:32	@relsqui	yes.
2014-08-28 21:27:39	@relsqui	<3
2014-08-28 21:27:42	@relsqui	I'm a fan
2014-08-28 21:27:43	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-28 21:27:52	Golem	On the upside!  A new khans card is out!
2014-08-28 21:27:57	@relsqui	ooh
2014-08-28 21:27:57	Golem	Its wierd
2014-08-28 21:28:05	 *	relsqui toddles to mythicspoiler
2014-08-28 21:28:06	Golem	http://www.mtgsalvation.com/cards/khans-of-tarkir/23350-soundclaw-mystic
2014-08-28 21:28:15	stormcrow	Let's see, wikipedia has portal originally coming out in 97, so I was...
2014-08-28 21:28:17	@relsqui	whoa, cool
2014-08-28 21:28:23	@relsqui	morph mana dork!
2014-08-28 21:28:45	Golem	Im not totaly convinced, but when such effects are repeatable they have been very powerful in the past
2014-08-28 21:28:51	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-28 21:29:06	Golem	And this has the potential to do 2 modes:  2 mana mana dork, or 3 mana big mana dork
2014-08-28 21:29:14	Golem	also 2 power for 2 mana is reasonable
2014-08-28 21:29:15	@relsqui	wait why are there two different set symbols on these
2014-08-28 21:29:29	Golem	what do you mean?
2014-08-28 21:29:37	@relsqui	http://mythicspoiler.com/
2014-08-28 21:29:46	@relsqui	look at set symbol on soundclaw mystic, then on mystic monastery
2014-08-28 21:29:49	@relsqui	oh, maybe duel decks?
2014-08-28 21:29:50	Golem	HMM
2014-08-28 21:29:53	Golem	yeah I think that was it
2014-08-28 21:30:04	Golem	I think those cards are coming out in the duel decks
2014-08-28 21:30:08	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-28 21:30:18	@relsqui	also which clan is that? I dunno my clans yet :)
2014-08-28 21:30:29	Golem	Aski?
2014-08-28 21:30:29	Golem	I think
2014-08-28 21:30:31	Golem	the RUG ones
2014-08-28 21:30:45	Golem	I dont know the clans very well yet either
2014-08-28 21:30:59	@relsqui	temur
2014-08-28 21:31:02	Golem	Temur
2014-08-28 21:31:04	Golem	yar
2014-08-28 21:31:08	Golem	MY clan ^_^
2014-08-28 21:31:10	@relsqui	hehehe
2014-08-28 21:31:15	Golem	not that it should come as any surprise ;p
2014-08-28 21:31:41	@relsqui	topics on blogatog earlier included how there should be an artifact that's the leg bone of a prosimian from that clan
2014-08-28 21:31:45	@relsqui	that is, a temur lemur femur
2014-08-28 21:31:52	Golem	>.<
2014-08-28 21:32:00	@relsqui	Golem: they've been at this ALL WEEK XD
2014-08-28 21:32:06	Golem	ye gods
2014-08-28 21:32:12	Golem	and little boarletts
2014-08-28 21:34:22	Golem	but back to the card, I do like that you can flip it up, and then tap it for mana, netting 2 extra mana on turn 3-4ish.
2014-08-28 21:34:33	Golem	Thats a big hop
2014-08-28 21:34:54	@relsqui	oh hey, yeah
2014-08-28 21:35:24	Golem	And it provides at least one of every temur color when it does that
2014-08-28 21:35:36	@relsqui	and two of whichever you like
2014-08-28 21:35:37	Golem	So I am interested to see what this can do for my green decks ^_^
2014-08-28 21:35:41	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-28 21:37:32	Golem	Hmm, 6 mana on turn 3....I hope we get another 1 mana dork
2014-08-28 21:37:41	Golem	*1 cost mana dork
2014-08-28 21:49:09	@relsqui	can't imagine we wouldn't ^_^
2014-08-28 21:49:17	Golem	I can -_-
2014-08-28 21:49:52	@relsqui	well, mystic's still in standard anyway
2014-08-28 21:50:04	Golem	RnD sometimes gets into this mode where they start nerfing what green and or blue can do before we ever get to play with the cards ;p
2014-08-28 21:50:11	Golem	Yar
2014-08-28 21:50:32	Golem	For a lot of mana ramp decks, the tipping point is 2 differant 1 mana dorks you can play
2014-08-28 21:50:46	Golem	Elf and bird, bird and pilgrim, elf and pilgrim, etc etc
2014-08-28 21:51:15	Golem	If you only have 1, you often wind up playing decks where you use that 1 mana dork as a 2 mana dork that can be played on turn 1
2014-08-28 21:51:16	@relsqui	dunno pilgrim
2014-08-28 21:51:25	Golem	Avacyn's Pilgrim
2014-08-28 21:51:35	@relsqui	ah
2014-08-28 21:52:05	Golem	2 mana dorks are nice, but they need to have a serious upside, see Sylvan Carytid.
2014-08-28 21:52:42	Golem	On the other hand, we might not have a 4 mana wrath. So the requirements might be differant
2014-08-28 21:53:05	Golem	although I kind of doubt it, Anger of the Gods and Drown in Sorrow are both still around post-rotation
2014-08-28 21:53:59	@relsqui	yeahhh <3
2014-08-29 01:34:44	@relsqui	TIL about this http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/3-Card_Blind
2014-08-29 01:34:46	@relsqui	and lol.
2014-08-29 02:07:03	 *	relsqui spreads the opposite card game to another channel
2014-08-29 02:15:57	@relsqui	http://manadeprived.com/brewing-board-soon-stacks/ I'm going to leave this here for easy finding later (and say ASA just to make logdiving easier)
2014-08-29 02:16:02	@relsqui	because we still need to do that soon because it's amazing
2014-08-29 02:17:48	@relsqui	.... now I'm trying to figure out what happens in ASA if you play Ad Nauseam XD
2014-08-29 02:17:55	@relsqui	you just blow through the deck I guess?
2014-08-29 02:18:58	@relsqui	and then have to play the entire deck immediately to avoid game loss
2014-08-29 02:25:13	@relsqui	haha other channel found another way to break ASA
2014-08-29 02:25:23	@relsqui	!card fervor
2014-08-29 02:25:23	oracle	Enchantment, 2R (3)
2014-08-29 02:25:23	oracle	Creatures you control have haste. (They can attack and {T} as soon as they come under your control.)
2014-08-29 02:25:27	@relsqui	!card myr propagator
2014-08-29 02:25:27	oracle	Artifact Creature — Myr 1/1, 3 (3)
2014-08-29 02:25:27	oracle	{3}, {T}: Put a token that's a copy of Myr Propagator onto the battlefield.
2014-08-29 04:28:11	aliaras	okay so wiht that mana dork you make a 2/2 for 3, then morph it for 2 and you have 4 mana floating at the end of that?
2014-08-29 10:12:59	@relsqui	aliaras: morph is a cost to put it into play
2014-08-29 10:13:08	@relsqui	unmorphing is free
2014-08-29 10:13:25	@relsqui	so you play it on turn 2, and on turn 3 you unmorph it, float three, tap it for a fourth
2014-08-29 10:42:04	aliaras	ahhhhhhh
2014-08-29 10:44:52	@relsqui	I'll be slightly more precise: unmorphing isn't just free, it's a special action that doesn't use the stack, like playing a land or suspending a card
2014-08-29 10:45:05	aliaras	oh, cool
2014-08-29 18:48:51	Corax	...What's 'ASA'?
2014-08-29 18:49:21	@relsqui	Corax: http://manadeprived.com/brewing-board-soon-stacks/ you're welcome.
2014-08-29 18:53:13	@mancat	dabah dump: requires glasses
2014-08-29 18:53:59	@relsqui	hehe
2014-08-29 20:12:27	Corax	Do we want to build a stack? And also, what sorts of cards might you be wanting to recruit for cube? I have a very large pile of Legacy commons/uncommons I can unload to make some room.
2014-08-29 20:13:20	@relsqui	we a million want to build a stack
2014-08-29 20:13:28	Corax	Sweet.
2014-08-29 20:13:28	@relsqui	re cube, that's a mancat question
2014-08-29 20:15:07	Corax	I will sift out 'too simple to be fun' and 'would break the format or make it unfun' as guided by the article, and see what that leaves.
2014-08-29 20:15:37	Corax	and mancat: ^
2014-08-29 20:15:55	Corax	Wow I'm tired. I so didn't need to ping that.
2014-08-29 20:31:19	Golem	mancat: I see you looking at standstill and I dont like it
2014-08-29 20:32:05	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-08-29 20:32:19	aliaras	ok relsqui
2014-08-29 20:32:41	@relsqui	sup :)
2014-08-29 20:32:50	aliaras	how does 2x blockers interact with deathouch?
2014-08-29 20:32:58	@relsqui	ooh, good one
2014-08-29 20:33:04	@relsqui	who has deathtouch?
2014-08-29 20:33:07	aliaras	venom sliver plus belligerent sliver
2014-08-29 20:33:17	aliaras	so, a 1/1 and a 2/2
2014-08-29 20:33:29	@relsqui	pls to whole situation. who's blocking whom
2014-08-29 20:33:35	aliaras	ok
2014-08-29 20:33:43	aliaras	^ attacking
2014-08-29 20:34:47	@relsqui	(whole attention isn't available right now because braindump, so full sentences are even more helpful than usual)
2014-08-29 20:36:22	aliaras	venom sliver 1/1 attacks, blocked by two 1/1 s. belligerent sliver (2/2 deathtouch) blocked by a 3/2 and a 2/3.
2014-08-29 20:36:54	aliaras	who dies and why?
2014-08-29 20:37:10	@relsqui	okay. which order do you want me to answer those two questions in? :)
2014-08-29 20:37:25	aliaras	why firdt pls
2014-08-29 20:37:27	aliaras	first
2014-08-29 20:37:37	@relsqui	okay. how well do you grok how multiple blocking works in the first place?
2014-08-29 20:37:43	aliaras	not :p
2014-08-29 20:37:49	@relsqui	okay, cool.
2014-08-29 20:38:08	@relsqui	gonna take a simple example then
2014-08-29 20:38:32	@relsqui	you swing into me with a 2/2, I block it with 1/1 and 3/3
2014-08-29 20:38:38	@relsqui	I finish declaring blockers
2014-08-29 20:38:54	@relsqui	(that's a stupid set of blockers but let's pretend it's not)
2014-08-29 20:38:58	@relsqui	(lol)
2014-08-29 20:39:36	@relsqui	normally this is where we'd move to the combat damage step, but because I multiblocked you have one extra thing to do first
2014-08-29 20:40:00	@relsqui	for each of your multiblocked creatures (just the one, here), you choose the order in which your attacker is going to deal damage to them
2014-08-29 20:40:12	@relsqui	it will deal all of its damage, unless it runs out of blockers
2014-08-29 20:40:15	@relsqui	(we're assuming no trample)
2014-08-29 20:40:23	@relsqui	but you, the attacker, choose what order the blockers soak it in.
2014-08-29 20:40:34	aliaras	nod
2014-08-29 20:40:44	@relsqui	so if A is blocked by B and C, you can have A deal up to fatal damage to B and then continue to C
2014-08-29 20:40:47	@relsqui	or vice versa.
2014-08-29 20:41:07	@relsqui	so you could have your 2/2 deal damage to the 1/1 first and then the 3/3
2014-08-29 20:41:12	@relsqui	or the 3/3 and then the 1/1
2014-08-29 20:41:38	stormcrow	(not that there would be damage left over of the 1/1)
2014-08-29 20:41:57	@relsqui	stormcrow: what?
2014-08-29 20:42:26	aliaras	nodnod
2014-08-29 20:42:27	stormcrow	if you assign 2 damage to the 3/3 and all remaining dmagae to the 1/1, nothing gets to the 1/1
2014-08-29 20:42:36	aliaras	this i understsnd
2014-08-29 20:42:41	@relsqui	oh, it wouldn't be left over *for* the 1/1
2014-08-29 20:42:41	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-29 20:42:48	@relsqui	stormcrow: I was going to make aliaras tell me that, but sure :P
2014-08-29 20:42:56	aliaras	haha
2014-08-29 20:43:00	stormcrow	huh? oh, I typo'd, didn't I?
2014-08-29 20:43:02	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-29 20:43:07	@relsqui	aliaras: okay, so.
2014-08-29 20:43:23	@relsqui	aliaras: you'll notice I didn't say "the attacker deals damage to each blocker up to the blocker's toughness"
2014-08-29 20:43:26	@relsqui	it's FATAL damage
2014-08-29 20:43:30	@relsqui	how much damage from a deathtoucher is fatal?
2014-08-29 20:43:40	aliaras	any
2014-08-29 20:43:43	@dom	1
2014-08-29 20:43:43	@dom	kek
2014-08-29 20:43:44	@relsqui	well, 1
2014-08-29 20:43:45	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-29 20:43:47	@relsqui	(hi dom!)
2014-08-29 20:43:52	@dom	MAXIMUM kek
2014-08-29 20:44:00	@relsqui	aliaras: so the deathtouch attacker deals 1 damage to first blocker, then 1 to second, tc.
2014-08-29 20:44:23	@relsqui	so your 1/1 venom sliver can only take out one thing, it's only got 1 point of damage to deal
2014-08-29 20:44:32	@relsqui	but your 2/2 sliver which is blocking two things ...
2014-08-29 20:44:42	aliaras	can dr
2014-08-29 20:44:46	@relsqui	?
2014-08-29 20:44:50	aliaras	deal 1 to each?
2014-08-29 20:44:55	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-29 20:44:56	@relsqui	(dr?)
2014-08-29 20:45:05	aliaras	phone
2014-08-29 20:45:08	@relsqui	ah
2014-08-29 20:45:12	@relsqui	okay, yeah
2014-08-29 20:45:16	@relsqui	so it trades with both, basically
2014-08-29 20:45:24	@relsqui	this has some fun side effects
2014-08-29 20:45:35	@relsqui	you have 1 life point left
2014-08-29 20:45:37	@relsqui	and a 15/15
2014-08-29 20:45:46	@relsqui	I swing into you with a 2/2 deathtouch squirrel
2014-08-29 20:45:51	@relsqui	with trample
2014-08-29 20:45:56	@relsqui	2/2 deathtouch trample squirrel
2014-08-29 20:45:59	@relsqui	you block with your 15/15
2014-08-29 20:46:05	@relsqui	d'you see what happens?
2014-08-29 20:46:20	Golem	I shal call him, Mr Nibbles
2014-08-29 20:46:27	@relsqui	lol golem++
2014-08-29 20:46:54	aliaras	wait seriois
2014-08-29 20:46:58	aliaras	serious
2014-08-29 20:47:14	@relsqui	yup
2014-08-29 20:47:20	@relsqui	Golem: lmk if I'm wrong about this, obv
2014-08-29 20:47:27	@mancat	i was saying the other day at magic club that tramble is a deceptively complex keyword, and this is why
2014-08-29 20:47:32	@mancat	relsqui:  you're right
2014-08-29 20:47:32	@relsqui	:)
2014-08-29 20:47:33	Golem	yar
2014-08-29 20:47:34	@relsqui	thanks
2014-08-29 20:47:38	stormcrow	huh
2014-08-29 20:47:48	stormcrow	well, I wold have gotten that wrong
2014-08-29 20:48:01	@relsqui	woo I know something stormcrow didn't know \o/
2014-08-29 20:48:04	@relsqui	I mean
2014-08-29 20:48:05	@mancat	basically, a trample attacker assigns what it considers to be lethal damage to each blocker in order
2014-08-29 20:48:05	@relsqui	what
2014-08-29 20:48:14	@mancat	how you define what's lethal is a little unintuitive some times
2014-08-29 20:48:20	@relsqui	mancat: well, all attackers do that; tramplers do that to each blocker and also the player
2014-08-29 20:48:22	Golem	;p
2014-08-29 20:48:24	@relsqui	yeah?
2014-08-29 20:48:34	Golem	mm
2014-08-29 20:48:34	@dom	karmabot: relsqui is also smug about beating stormcrow
2014-08-29 20:48:34	karmabot	K, dom.
2014-08-29 20:48:38	@relsqui	v_v
2014-08-29 20:48:41	Golem	thats a very good explaination
2014-08-29 20:48:47	@dom	we'll just leave that ambiguous
2014-08-29 20:48:47	Golem	imma steal it
2014-08-29 20:48:51	@dom	for future generations
2014-08-29 20:48:51	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-29 20:48:55	@relsqui	dom: -_-
2014-08-29 20:48:55	@mancat	for examle if amy attacks with a trample 3/3 and nate blocks with a 0/1 indestructible Darksteel Myr, 2 damage tramples over even though the blocker wont' die
2014-08-29 20:49:12	@relsqui	(judge portal player naming conventions)++
2014-08-29 20:49:54	@dom	I like to use jeff and fred for all naming conventions, interchangeably
2014-08-29 20:49:59	@dom	really livens up the mood
2014-08-29 20:50:13	@mancat	alice and bob would like to have a word with you
2014-08-29 20:50:15	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-29 20:50:19	@relsqui	alice and .... nob
2014-08-29 20:50:26	@mancat	lolol
2014-08-29 20:50:38	@dom	vegeta and kakarot
2014-08-29 20:50:53	@relsqui	(the joke for people who haven't seen this thing is that example player names in judge questions are always initialed A for the active player and N for the non-active player)
2014-08-29 20:50:59	@dom	vegeta swings in with a 1/1 nappa and kakarot has a 15/15 gohan on the field
2014-08-29 20:51:35	@dom	if krillin has already died, how many episodes until vegeta is a good guy?
2014-08-29 20:51:42	@dom	dbz math with dom!
2014-08-29 20:51:45	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-29 20:51:48	Golem	undeterminate
2014-08-29 20:51:56	Golem	krillian dies at too many points for it to be a referance
2014-08-29 20:52:51	@dom	yes, but since we can use the power level of vegeta as a constant in this scenario
2014-08-29 20:52:53	stormcrow	I'm not sure vegeta was ever really good. I think he just realized he had more to gain by not killing everything all the time.
2014-08-29 20:53:09	@relsqui	reminds me of dom's d&d character >_>
2014-08-29 20:53:19	@dom	kefka is not that bad
2014-08-29 20:53:21	@dom	honestly
2014-08-29 20:53:28	@relsqui	nah, he's not
2014-08-29 20:53:29	Golem	eh, he had a heroic death eventually
2014-08-29 20:53:30	@relsqui	I'm just teasing
2014-08-29 20:53:35	Golem	it just took a long, long time
2014-08-29 20:54:22	@dom	vegeta's number of ressurections is bested only by krillin and goku
2014-08-29 20:54:25	@dom	in that order I think
2014-08-29 20:55:45	stormcrow	didn't vegeta and goku both die-and-come-back twice?
2014-08-29 20:56:35	@dom	goku has died like 6 times
2014-08-29 20:56:42	@dom	vegeta has died twice I think
2014-08-29 20:57:23	stormcrow	6? where did you get 6?
2014-08-29 20:58:01	stormcrow	I rememeber against Raditz and Cell, but what other times?
2014-08-29 20:58:36	@dom	I thought he died vs vegeta too
2014-08-29 20:58:41	@dom	hang on, its wiki-ing time
2014-08-29 20:58:45	Golem	raditz, cell, majin bu
2014-08-29 20:58:52	Golem	those are the ones I remember
2014-08-29 20:59:16	stormcrow	Golem: What? no, he started out dead against buu, then came back to life and won without dying again
2014-08-29 20:59:39	Golem	really?  I thought he died again and had to fight super-bu whilst dead
2014-08-29 21:00:00	@relsqui	I don't know if I actually want to watch this show or just enjoy these descriptons
2014-08-29 21:00:11	@relsqui	(descriptons, of course, being the atomic units of description)
2014-08-29 21:00:13	Golem	Watch the show enough to see if its to your taste
2014-08-29 21:00:19	Golem	then watch DBZ abridged
2014-08-29 21:00:23	Golem	because that is way funnier
2014-08-29 21:00:35	@dom	dont watch dbz at all
2014-08-29 21:00:39	@relsqui	lol
2014-08-29 21:00:43	@dom	its too much filler
2014-08-29 21:00:55	@dom	its like 300 episodes or something
2014-08-29 21:01:03	stormcrow	yeah, dbz abridged is awesome, but you might get more jokes if you've seen the series
2014-08-29 21:01:09	@relsqui	I could fant it
2014-08-29 21:01:11	@relsqui	and watch it on 2x speed
2014-08-29 21:01:12	@dom	it looks like goku has only died twice, but frequently comes back whilst dead
2014-08-29 21:01:21	@dom	dead-but-just-kidding
2014-08-29 21:01:50	stormcrow	granted, two times awesome amount of comedy is still an awesome amount of comedy
2014-08-29 21:02:11	@dom	dbz is not terrible if you know when the fights happen
2014-08-29 21:02:20	@dom	and watch the important story filler
2014-08-29 21:02:28	@dom	but there are a lot of power up episodes
2014-08-29 21:02:43	@relsqui	I seem to understand there's something about a spirit bomb
2014-08-29 21:02:55	@mancat	relsqui++ that's basically all that actually happens in DBZ
2014-08-29 21:03:04	Golem	Ghosts
2014-08-29 21:03:09	@dom	spirit bomb is not actually that important
2014-08-29 21:03:15	@dom	its used twice for story iirc
2014-08-29 21:03:15	@mancat	but it's cool
2014-08-29 21:03:18	@dom	it is cool
2014-08-29 21:03:20	Golem	3 times
2014-08-29 21:03:26	Golem	4 if you count the movies
2014-08-29 21:03:29	@relsqui	agh
2014-08-29 21:03:30	@relsqui	mancat
2014-08-29 21:03:30	Golem	but it failed twice
2014-08-29 21:03:33	@relsqui	do you wanna watch wakfu??
2014-08-29 21:03:45	@relsqui	you successfully got me hooked on this thing
2014-08-29 21:03:47	Golem	mancat: your answer should be yes
2014-08-29 21:04:37	@mancat	relsqui: lol sure
2014-08-29 21:04:41	@relsqui	yay!
2014-08-29 21:05:18	Golem	I will watch with you in spirit
2014-08-29 21:06:33	 *	dom will watch in spirit
2014-08-29 21:06:39	@relsqui	<3
2014-08-29 21:06:54	Golem	Actually I need to watch the end of season 2 still
2014-08-29 21:06:55	Golem	HMM
2014-08-29 21:07:05	 *	relsqui has only seen the beginning of season 2
2014-08-29 21:07:18	@mancat	we're on line episode 2:2
2014-08-29 21:07:26	@mancat	*on like
2014-08-29 21:31:52	@relsqui	ah yay that feel when ibuprofen kicks in
2014-08-29 21:40:44	@relsqui	mancat: our turbine is like my frog thief combo
2014-08-29 21:40:48	@relsqui	it's really awesome in theory
2014-08-29 21:40:51	@relsqui	and has never actually been shown to work

2014-08-30 05:31:38	aliaras	hahaha
2014-08-30 19:02:32	@mancat	this control deck is exceptionally derp
2014-08-30 19:02:40	@mancat	but oh man it has some strong combos in it
2014-08-30 19:02:48	@mancat	the control part is just pretty shaky, lol
2014-08-30 19:06:28	@relsqui	haha

2014-08-30 19:29:42	Golem	yup
2014-08-30 19:29:45	Golem	seems like it
2014-08-30 19:30:12	@relsqui	OH SHIT RIGHT THAT'S TODAY
2014-08-30 19:30:22	Golem	On the other hand I like Temur ascendancy, but i dont see how we are going to make use of it without birds of paradise or an equivalent

2014-08-30 19:30:40	Golem	If they hadent sold out in like, half an hour, I might very well be up there right now
2014-08-30 19:30:40	@mancat	is so maximum, lol
2014-08-30 19:30:41	@mancat	it's like
2014-08-30 19:30:50	@mancat	"three color 6-drop crazy bombs all over the place!"
2014-08-30 19:31:02	@relsqui	ooh I like the new formatting on that modal
2014-08-30 19:31:03	@relsqui	sultai charm
2014-08-30 19:31:19	@relsqui	mancat: well also keep in mind there's some selection bias

2014-08-30 19:31:27	@relsqui	:P
2014-08-30 19:32:59	Golem	Check out Herald of Anafenza
2014-08-30 19:32:59	@mancat	yeah but there are 2-drop good cards too, presumably
2014-08-30 19:33:02	@mancat	oh man
2014-08-30 19:33:04	@mancat	this set
2014-08-30 19:33:06	@mancat	what the hell
2014-08-30 19:33:10	@mancat	this looks awesome and also silly
2014-08-30 19:33:10	Golem	Its so timmy
2014-08-30 19:33:14	Golem	so very timmy
2014-08-30 19:33:15	@relsqui	yes
2014-08-30 19:33:22	@mancat	such timy
2014-08-30 19:33:30	@relsqui	I am ... I am into this
2014-08-30 19:33:31	@relsqui	this looks fun.
2014-08-30 19:34:03	@relsqui	huh delve
2014-08-30 19:34:06	@relsqui	graveyard convoke :D
2014-08-30 19:34:07	Golem	Ill be happier when I see something that looks like it wasnt ment for commander Iguess
2014-08-30 19:34:11	@relsqui	yeah
2014-08-30 19:34:31	Golem	Right now I see a lot of intereting mechanics but not a lot of efficency
2014-08-30 19:35:10	Golem	Which may just be how things go, but its a big set.  We will have to see
2014-08-30 19:37:15	Golem	Narset is interesting, but seems frail.  Any 6 drop creature that dies in combat with a courser of kruphix is questionable in my book, even if it has a good ability
2014-08-30 19:37:55	Golem	For that matter, why do all the clan leaders have 2 toughness >.<
2014-08-30 19:38:01	Golem	(thus far)]

2014-08-31 13:58:15	@relsqui	so I don't have the faintest clue what he would have bought
2014-08-31 13:58:55	@relsqui	.... also curious under what circumstances he had the opportunity to impulse purchase magic cards
2014-08-31 13:59:07	@relsqui	I can see him being in a game store for something else, though

2014-08-31 14:04:21	@relsqui	mancat: (how long is your class?)
2014-08-31 14:04:52	@relsqui	I wish gatherer comments weren't broken so I could post that swamp is too OP for standard, except I'm sure someone has already done that
2014-08-31 14:05:23	@dom	apparently i can do any of the three days

2014-08-31 14:19:33	@mancat	i rather agree
2014-08-31 14:19:38	@mancat	i think it's good
2014-08-31 14:20:04	@dom	I like Herald and Sarkhan, the rest is kinda meh
2014-08-31 14:20:08	@dom	the mana dork with morph is cool
2014-08-31 14:20:34	@dom	and umm narset

2014-08-31 14:21:30	@dom	calling it now: 1/1 with $keyword and outlast for W is going to be a thing
2014-08-31 14:33:16	@mancat	narset is derp
2014-08-31 14:33:24	@mancat	he's a 6 drop with 2 toughness
2014-08-31 14:35:32	@dom	he is derp
2014-08-31 14:36:25	@mancat	i am excited about this set
2014-08-31 14:36:30	@mancat	i think i may buy a box of it
2014-08-31 14:37:29	@dom	im waiting to see more of it
2014-08-31 14:37:41	@dom	but I will likely buy a bunch of boosters, because im dom and thats what dom does

2014-08-31 14:38:30	@mancat	new sorin is so fucking bland though...
2014-08-31 14:38:37	@mancat	he's hardly different from Lord of Innistrad

2014-08-31 14:45:45	@relsqui	> I had a funny mental aftermath to the Penn Station experience. It struck me that this is why people use Facebook, that you can be carrying on about, say, experiences in the course of a trip in real time (more or less). Do your raving right then instead of saving it! And then it struck me that that's exactly the reason not to use Facebook.

2014-08-31 14:46:00	@relsqui	oh, point continues in following sentence
2014-08-31 14:46:02	@relsqui	> Along about 4 a.m. I was thinking things about Amtrak management, the city of New York, and the course of Western civilization that were better not committed to print.
2014-08-31 14:51:14	@relsqui	(the experience in question is a four-hour layover in the middle of the night with no comforts whatsoever at the station)
2014-08-31 14:51:45	@relsqui	unlike in, say, chicago union station, where there's a fancy little lounge and it's all very forties
2014-08-31 14:57:22	aliaras	holy fucking shit
2014-08-31 14:57:24	aliaras	drafting on mtgo

2014-08-31 14:57:59	aliaras	MAYBE I SHOULD PLAY IN RED GUYS
2014-08-31 14:58:46	@dom	mfw you don't always play red
2014-08-31 14:59:11	aliaras	haha
2014-08-31 14:59:17	aliaras	it's really overdrafted in m15
2014-08-31 14:59:29	aliaras	tend to play a lot of golgari or whatever blue-black is
2014-08-31 14:59:36	aliaras	because black is IME underdrafted
2014-08-31 15:00:48	@dom	dimir is blue black
2014-08-31 15:01:04	@dom	I like dimir for control, honestly
2014-08-31 15:01:09	@dom	or azorius
2014-08-31 15:01:13	aliaras	yeah, dimir control owns
2014-08-31 15:01:20	@dom	golgari is greenblack
2014-08-31 15:01:24	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-31 15:01:25	@dom	golgari is relsqui
2014-08-31 15:01:46	@relsqui	<_<
2014-08-31 15:01:46	aliaras	yeah so i'm either golgari or dimir depending on first few packs
2014-08-31 15:01:46	@dom	black is usually underdrafted too, yeah
2014-08-31 15:01:53	aliaras	and black in m15 is totally fine
2014-08-31 15:02:01	@dom	they're all fine, honestly
2014-08-31 15:02:16	@dom	blue is meh on creatures, but makes a nice springboard for anything else
2014-08-31 15:02:26	@dom	I like the flyer w/ artifacts in blue, and amphin pathmage
2014-08-31 15:02:34	@dom	and frost lynx
2014-08-31 15:02:46	aliaras	yeah
2014-08-31 15:02:55	aliaras	I also like welkin tern and research assistant
2014-08-31 15:03:00	aliaras	although he's a bit more controlling
2014-08-31 15:03:03	@dom	I don't like welkin tern
2014-08-31 15:03:05	@dom	errr
2014-08-31 15:03:09	@dom	research assistant
2014-08-31 15:03:14	@dom	welkin tern is doubleplusgood
2014-08-31 15:03:20	aliaras	why not on research guy?
2014-08-31 15:03:26	aliaras	he can block p well
2014-08-31 15:03:31	@dom	isn't it pay 4 to draw and discard?
2014-08-31 15:03:38	@dom	!card research assistant

2014-08-31 15:03:48	@dom	>> i guess he is a 2-drop
2014-08-31 15:03:58	@dom	but thats really just 2 for a 1/3
2014-08-31 15:04:03	@dom	which is not great, imo
2014-08-31 15:04:33	aliaras	eh so, if you're playing control
2014-08-31 15:04:41	@dom	did you guys see the krieger cosplay with his anime holo-wife playing magic?
2014-08-31 15:04:54	aliaras	it's a dude that can block a lot of 1 and 2-drops, even some 3-drops
2014-08-31 15:04:56	@dom	I wouldn't play research assistant even if I was playing control
2014-08-31 15:05:02	@dom	there are better walls

2014-08-31 15:05:12	aliaras	sure
2014-08-31 15:05:17	@dom	I would play that 100 times over research assistant
2014-08-31 15:05:18	aliaras	but why not both :P
2014-08-31 15:05:26	@dom	because there are better cards
2014-08-31 15:05:30	@dom	!card divination

2014-08-31 15:07:04	@dom	why are you watching wakfu and not archer
2014-08-31 15:07:15	@relsqui	because it's way, way more to my taste
2014-08-31 15:07:32	@dom	I guess
2014-08-31 15:07:34	@relsqui	I've seen a couple of episodes of archer and didn't particularly want to watch any more
2014-08-31 15:07:53	@dom	archer is way closer to my tastes than wakfu :P
2014-08-31 15:07:56	@relsqui	yep
2014-08-31 15:08:02	@relsqui	luckily, both exist!

2014-08-31 15:08:57	@relsqui	if you did you'd be really bad at it
2014-08-31 15:09:01	@relsqui	'cause you keep watching it with us
2014-08-31 15:09:19	@dom	my tolerance levels are very high
2014-08-31 15:09:58	@dom	but like I said, I'd be lying if I said I hated it

2014-08-31 15:30:27	@mancat	(male bonding experiences)++
2014-08-31 15:30:31	@mancat	lol
2014-08-31 15:34:50	aliaras	ok i'm super proud of this play
2014-08-31 15:35:20	aliaras	on my side: bronze sable w/burning anger. opponent's side: juggernaut, miner's bane
2014-08-31 15:35:38	@dom	mancat: kek
2014-08-31 15:35:48	aliaras	in my hand: soul of shandalar, inferno fist, sixth land, goblin chump (one of the 1/1 1-drops)
2014-08-31 15:36:03	aliaras	so i played the sixth land, put the fist on my sable and then put the chump out
2014-08-31 15:36:06	aliaras	passed
2014-08-31 15:36:15	aliaras	opponent swung with juggernaut (mandatory) and the miner's bane dude
2014-08-31 15:36:30	aliaras	sniped the miner's bane with the super-sable, blocked juggernaut with my goblin chump, doing 1 damage
2014-08-31 15:36:43	aliaras	sacced inferno fist on opponent's second main to finish off the juggernaut
2014-08-31 15:36:51	@dom	max kek for value
2014-08-31 15:36:53	aliaras	*then* slammed the soul and won >_>
2014-08-31 15:37:28	 *	relsqui can bond over busting shit up too :/
2014-08-31 15:38:28	@mancat	have any decks to tear up?
2014-08-31 15:39:14	 *	relsqui looks thoughtful
2014-08-31 15:39:16	@relsqui	my dad might
2014-08-31 15:39:16	@dom	are we speaking of ripping up proxies/cards or making a deck very fast
2014-08-31 15:39:25	@relsqui	dom: lol, your literal deck you dope
2014-08-31 15:39:27	@dom	because both could be meant
2014-08-31 15:39:46	@relsqui	mancat: I was mostly disagreeing with your gendering it, though
2014-08-31 15:43:43	@mancat	relsqui: i got that. I don't particularly agree, I was refering to the trope, not making an exclusionary statement.
2014-08-31 15:44:34	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-31 15:44:48	@relsqui	I think we agree about what you intended and disagree about how that works, in language/culture
2014-08-31 15:44:51	@relsqui	but we agree about what you intended.
2014-08-31 15:45:10	@mancat	the point to me is that some personalities click that way and others don't so easily
2014-08-31 15:45:58	@dom	I got to smash a board in half with a crowbar today
2014-08-31 15:46:15	@dom	we didn't have a saw near us and the axe was too long
2014-08-31 15:46:22	@dom	so I fucking smashed it until it broke
2014-08-31 15:46:26	@dom	it was kekworthy
2014-08-31 15:46:40	 *	mancat is a fan of this

2014-08-31 16:16:10	@relsqui	that's a card and also .... lore
2014-08-31 16:18:25	aliaras	tapping out for lava axe after making a seemingly-reckless attack: feels good.
2014-08-31 16:18:53	aliaras	thanks to convoke could attack into superior board position and get 9 in, opponent was at 14, and I'd only take 10 from it.
2014-08-31 16:19:21	aliaras	annnnnnd I'm in what would be the finals, were I not playing swiss queues, for the first time ever :)
2014-08-31 16:36:57	@relsqui	lolol my mom, talking about when my dad is back east to visit. "we go to a cafe and I'm on my phone and he's on his. are we hip or what?"

2014-08-31 23:28:22	@relsqui	I feel like it would start two kinds of conversations: magic players getting it and loling, and non-magic players saying "what the living fuck is on your shirt"
2014-08-31 23:28:29	@relsqui	and I would enjoy both of those
2014-08-31 23:37:21	@relsqui	... the more I think about the more I'm curious what sorin is doing in tarkir.
2014-08-31 23:37:41	@mancat	he's a nosy bugger
2014-08-31 23:38:52	@relsqui	he is.
2014-08-31 23:39:02	@relsqui	"when's return to tarkir?" lol
2014-08-31 23:40:53	@relsqui	mancat: also, he's referencing ugin's tomb? did we already know ugin's dead?
2014-08-31 23:42:34	@relsqui	or does that even imply that
2014-08-31 23:44:54	@relsqui	"delve isn't an old mechanic, it
2014-08-31 23:44:59	@relsqui	's from future sight! so it was from the future"
2014-08-31 23:52:16	stormcrow	I'll field the thing about Ugin being dead or not
2014-08-31 23:53:05	stormcrow	Nicol Bolas said that he "put Ugin where he lies." Whether that meas he actually killed Ugin or not is something that Doug Beyer's tumblr has been having a lot of fun with
2014-08-31 23:53:54	@relsqui	haha
2014-08-31 23:53:56	@relsqui	I must've missed that
2014-08-31 23:53:57	stormcrow	but the latest spoilers do imply that he's some flavor of Dead. Of course, if time shenanigans are involved in this block, all bets are off.
2014-08-31 23:54:03	@relsqui	right.
2014-08-31 23:54:20	@relsqui	haha, question on cranial insertion about genesis hydra with x=0
2014-08-31 23:54:28	@relsqui	and topdecking ornithopter
2014-08-31 23:54:28	@relsqui	A: If the Ornithopter were among the zero cards you'll be revealing from your library, you could do this. But since you're revealing zero cards, there's zero chance of the zero-CMC Ornithopter being among them, and it'll just have to stay in your library.
2014-08-31 23:55:38	@relsqui	I got that right, and also the next one which was a little tricker (if you genesis hydra into a bestow creature, can you bestow it)
2014-08-31 23:55:43	@relsqui	trickier*
2014-08-31 23:55:48	@relsqui	this makes me feel better about missing the first one today

2014-09-01 00:00:33	@relsqui	oh right I did see this but it was before I saw the card
2014-09-01 00:00:49	@relsqui	lol, doug <3
2014-09-01 00:01:00	@relsqui	karmabot: nicol bolas is a liar liar pants most certainly on fire
2014-09-01 00:01:00	karmabot	What?
2014-09-01 00:01:08	@relsqui	karmabot: (nicol bolas) is a liar liar pants most certainly on fire
2014-09-01 00:01:08	karmabot	Okay, relsqui.
2014-09-01 00:01:27	@relsqui	stormcrow: lmao I just read the tags on that
2014-09-01 00:01:30	@relsqui	didn't see it on rss
2014-09-01 00:03:58	stormcrow	As for Sorin, presumably he's looking for Ugin to help deal with the Eldrazi, but the flavor on Bitter Revelation suggests that that's not going to go well.
2014-09-01 00:05:07	@relsqui	indeed :(
2014-09-01 00:05:25	@relsqui	oh geeze ,also relevant http://mythicspoiler.com/ktk/cards/uginsnexus.jpg
2014-09-01 00:05:51	@relsqui	which is also an interesting card
2014-09-01 00:07:26	stormcrow	I like those artifacts that have a beneficial "leaves the battlefield" trigger
2014-09-01 00:08:19	stormcrow	It's the sorta thing that makes you want to run a bunch of ensoul artifact/tezzeret, agent of bolas, make it into a creature, then dare your opponent to do something about the creature being swung at their face.
2014-09-01 00:08:51	@relsqui	yeah.
2014-09-01 00:08:55	@relsqui	oh what
2014-09-01 00:08:56	@relsqui	> Q: If I attack with Geist of Saint Traft, can I use Trickbind at end of combat to keep the Angel token from being exiled?
2014-09-01 00:08:56	stormcrow	Alternately, doom blade it yourself.
2014-09-01 00:09:01	@relsqui	I totally didn't expect that to work
2014-09-01 00:09:05	@relsqui	but it does
2014-09-01 00:12:24	@relsqui	oh weird, this is another one I got wrong
2014-09-01 00:12:25	@relsqui	Q: I control a Phyrexian Tower. Can I cast Flash, put a creature from my hand onto the battlefield, and then activate Phyrexian Tower, sacrificing the creature to get ?
2014-09-01 00:12:33	@relsqui	to get {B}{B} is the end of that

2014-09-01 01:59:28	@mancat	23:28 <@relsqui> I feel like it would start two kinds of conversations: magic players getting it and loling, and non-magic players saying "what the living fuck is on your shirt"
2014-09-01 01:59:31	@mancat	23:28 <@relsqui> and I would enjoy both of those
2014-09-01 01:59:34	@mancat	23:37 <@relsqui> ... the more I think about the more I'm curious what sorin is doing in tarkir.

2014-09-01 09:14:39	@relsqui	early in design
2014-09-01 09:14:49	@relsqui	I'm amazed that they even considered that (and got pretty far into laying out how it would work)

2014-09-01 10:06:11	@relsqui	it's weird hearing the voice of a planeswalker
2014-09-01 10:06:19	@relsqui	like seeing a book character on film for the first time, you know
2014-09-01 11:48:00	@dom	Howl of the Horde seems so strong
2014-09-01 11:48:41	@dom	"Swing with 2 goblins for 2, howl of the horde, lightning bolt x 2, responses? Thats what I thougt."
2014-09-01 11:50:15	@dom	crackling doom is cool too, but I have the feeling its a reprint
2014-09-01 11:51:32	@dom	sidisi looks cool too
2014-09-01 11:51:33	@relsqui	it is
2014-09-01 11:51:35	@relsqui	and yeah
2014-09-01 11:51:44	@relsqui	the catch with sidisi is you only get one zombie per mill event
2014-09-01 11:51:49	@relsqui	regardless of how many creatures you mill
2014-09-01 11:51:50	@relsqui	but still
2014-09-01 11:52:05	@relsqui	(unless I'm reading it wrong but I don't think I am)
2014-09-01 11:53:25	@dom	no, thats correct
2014-09-01 11:53:31	@dom	but thats not too awful to not play
2014-09-01 11:53:53	@dom	esp. with all the reanimation mechanics in m15 and new delve, plus fucking nighthowler
2014-09-01 11:54:24	@relsqui	nighthowler <3 <3 <3
2014-09-01 11:54:33	@relsqui	dom: what I *really* want to run with her is splinterfright
2014-09-01 11:55:17	@relsqui	the other thing about sidisi, which aliaras pointed out and I was thinking too, is that ... swinging with a 3/3 on turn 5 is not actually that safe a bet
2014-09-01 11:55:24	@relsqui	seeing what we've seen of this set
2014-09-01 11:55:48	@relsqui	bbut shit like aqueous form is in her colors, and also you can spend turn 5 bestowing nighthowler for lols
2014-09-01 11:56:22	@dom	I wouldn't swing with her except on an empty board

2014-09-01 14:12:20	@mancat	aqueous form is good with both of those, which helps
2014-09-01 14:12:22	@relsqui	yes
2014-09-01 14:12:25	@relsqui	I was gonna say
2014-09-01 14:12:28	@relsqui	and in both of their colors
2014-09-01 14:12:37	@relsqui	you guys I am looking forward to drafting this.
2014-09-01 14:12:39	@mancat	but in a vaccuum i don't like narset very much at all
2014-09-01 14:12:49	@mancat	i know, right!
2014-09-01 14:12:50	@relsqui	suit yoself :)
2014-09-01 14:12:57	@mancat	i'm thinking pretty seriously about buying a box for myself
2014-09-01 14:13:08	@relsqui	hehehe
2014-09-01 14:13:33	@relsqui	we've only seen three khans so far, right?
2014-09-01 14:13:50	@relsqui	... oh, weird
2014-09-01 14:14:01	@dom	also narset is 6 mana >>
2014-09-01 14:14:02	@relsqui	the price has come DOWN on annihilation
2014-09-01 14:14:06	@relsqui	dom: I can't argue with that
2014-09-01 14:14:20	@relsqui	I just want her to dump all my burn in your face
2014-09-01 14:14:38	@relsqui	hell, if you time it right, it only has to go off once
2014-09-01 14:14:40	@dom	a deck with her wouldn't be pure burn though
2014-09-01 14:14:44	@relsqui	nah
2014-09-01 14:14:49	@relsqui	eh
2014-09-01 14:14:50	@relsqui	we'll see :)
2014-09-01 14:14:50	@dom	it'd have to be mostly control because of the colors
2014-09-01 14:14:57	@dom	I mean fetch lands, yeah
2014-09-01 14:15:00	@dom	and shard lands
2014-09-01 14:15:02	@dom	but still
2014-09-01 14:15:18	@dom	also is jeskai windscout some kind of joke?
2014-09-01 14:15:32	@dom	yes it has prowess, but its 3 for a 2/1 flyer
2014-09-01 14:16:06	@dom	I hope we get an outlast lord
2014-09-01 14:16:16	@dom	thats like "play outlast effects at instant speed"
2014-09-01 14:16:25	@dom	then the outlast deck is complete, no matter what they print
2014-09-01 14:16:42	@relsqui	heh
2014-09-01 14:16:51	@relsqui	yeah lotta people complaining to maro about thta
2014-09-01 14:17:09	@dom	its because its not outlast
2014-09-01 14:17:14	@dom	its bide-your-time
2014-09-01 14:17:28	@dom	you're not outlasting your opponents, you're just not swinging with your creatures
2014-09-01 14:17:36	@dom	which is not where you want to be in a white aggro deck
2014-09-01 14:17:42	@dom	or any aggro deck, really
2014-09-01 14:17:50	@relsqui	... it's not an aggro mechanic
2014-09-01 14:18:08	@dom	its on cheap white creatures with swarm mechanics
2014-09-01 14:18:15	@dom	its definitely an aggro mechanic
2014-09-01 14:18:35	@relsqui	hmmm
2014-09-01 14:18:38	@dom	its for "my opponent dropped a fatty turn 4 and 5"
2014-09-01 14:18:44	@dom	"how the fuck do i get there with a 2/2"
2014-09-01 14:18:48	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-01 14:19:49	@dom	also, outside of the mana dork, none of the morph cards look very good
2014-09-01 14:20:28	@relsqui	heh imagining someone with, like, 3-4 different lands down
2014-09-01 14:20:33	@relsqui	they play a morph creature, another morph creature
2014-09-01 14:20:36	@relsqui	"wtf clan are they playing????"
2014-09-01 14:22:16	@relsqui	hehe, people are pointing out synergy between sidisi and jtlg
2014-09-01 14:22:27	@relsqui	activate jace's +1, make a zombie
2014-09-01 14:34:42	@relsqui	omg you guys I want to do anything but get work done right now
2014-09-01 15:08:59	Golem	So far the fetchlands look to be the best part of khans.  Still, we have some 200 odd cards to go
2014-09-01 15:09:11	Golem	And we havent even seen the temur lord yet
2014-09-01 15:11:08	@relsqui	yeah
2014-09-01 15:11:12	@relsqui	or azban, right?
2014-09-01 15:11:38	Golem	I yar
2014-09-01 15:11:43	Golem	HMM
2014-09-01 15:11:51	Golem	for pitys sake wizards, green needs TRAMPLE
2014-09-01 15:11:59	Golem	not deathtouch, not reach, TRAMPLE
2014-09-01 15:12:11	Golem	its the ability you made FOR GREEN because green NEEDED IT.
2014-09-01 15:12:15	Golem	BAH
2014-09-01 15:28:36	@mancat	nUbee insisted that I fill out a time sheet for 2.5 hours of work this month, submit it, then print it, sign it, scan it, and email it to him
2014-09-01 15:28:48	@mancat	i told him I didn't have time to get him a scanned copy
2014-09-01 15:28:57	@mancat	he told me to make a pdf and sign it in GIMP
2014-09-01 15:29:06	@mancat	so i put a GPG signature on it
2014-09-01 15:29:22	@mancat	-_- timesheets...
2014-09-01 15:35:22	@relsqui	lmao
2014-09-01 15:35:39	@relsqui	mancat: wait, didn't you have bajr scan yours when I did mine?
2014-09-01 15:35:42	@relsqui	did you have to change it after that?
2014-09-01 15:38:29	@mancat	i did, i never got it though
2014-09-01 15:38:35	@mancat	and i didn't get back to bajr to ask him to resend it
2014-09-01 15:38:59	@relsqui	oh, sucks
2014-09-01 15:39:05	@mancat	whatever
2014-09-01 15:39:08	@relsqui	yeah
2014-09-01 15:39:16	@mancat	i feel kinda bad for giving rob sucha  hard time about time sheets every month
2014-09-01 15:39:20	@relsqui	lol
2014-09-01 15:39:24	@mancat	but it's kinda ridiculous how srs he is about it
2014-09-01 15:39:37	@relsqui	I don't think it's ridiculous how serious he is about it, but how it manifests is kinda silly
2014-09-01 15:39:43	@mancat	i mean maybe things are more srs because it's educaitonal so it's sorta a state job, but like
2014-09-01 15:40:03	@mancat	is it really a big deal if i *only* use the "submit timesheet" button to turn it in?
2014-09-01 15:40:14	@relsqui	I think that's Beth, actually
2014-09-01 15:40:16	nightfly	yup
2014-09-01 15:40:23	@mancat	*shrug*
2014-09-01 15:40:35	@relsqui	the system's pretty derp all around
2014-09-01 15:41:13	@relsqui	hehe, a very dear internet friend of mine who lives in CA is in Detroit atm
2014-09-01 15:41:18	@relsqui	I was like "so I'm going to be in CA while you're gone"
2014-09-01 15:41:20	@relsqui	and he is like WHAT
2014-09-01 15:41:29	@relsqui	XD
2014-09-01 15:41:36	@relsqui	he lives in LA, I wouldn't have seen him anyway
2014-09-01 15:41:41	@relsqui	but I would really fuckin' love to
2014-09-01 16:31:44	aliaras	End Hostilities: heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Wrath sup
2014-09-01 16:32:24	aliaras	also the outlast with the Ainok Bond-Kin looks good
2014-09-01 16:32:28	aliaras	make dudes
2014-09-01 16:32:31	aliaras	pump dudes
2014-09-01 16:32:35	aliaras	everyone is first striker
2014-09-01 16:32:49	@relsqui	aliaras: yah, but while they're outlasting you can't block with 'em
2014-09-01 16:32:54	@relsqui	I guess if you have enough dudes you can carefully trade off
2014-09-01 16:32:55	aliaras	's true
2014-09-01 16:33:01	@relsqui	pump your extra dudes
2014-09-01 16:33:03	aliaras	yeah
2014-09-01 16:33:11	@mancat	you can block and then outlast in response
2014-09-01 16:33:15	aliaras	if it's in the early game when you don't need all your blocker dudes
2014-09-01 16:33:18	@relsqui	mancat: sure can't.
2014-09-01 16:33:19	aliaras	mancat: sorcery-speed
2014-09-01 16:33:20	@mancat	i think that guy si good
2014-09-01 16:33:20	@relsqui	outlast is sorcery speed
2014-09-01 16:33:25	@mancat	i think outlast will be strong in draft
2014-09-01 16:33:25	@dom	I mean, the answer is really vigilance
2014-09-01 16:33:27	@mancat	wat?
2014-09-01 16:33:29	@mancat	oh dude
2014-09-01 16:33:32	aliaras	yeah, I'm thinking in draft too

2014-09-01 16:34:05	@dom	I hope the rest of khans is good, because im not seeing much thats making me go "yeah im playing that"
2014-09-01 16:34:08	@relsqui	mancat: speaking of which, saturday afternoon make our own draft in berkeley?
2014-09-01 16:34:24	@mancat	sure
2014-09-01 16:34:25	 *	dom fixes right click for this version of the kernel on his laptop
2014-09-01 16:34:31	@mancat	we can also draft off sean's cube
2014-09-01 16:34:51	@relsqui	yeah, naomi asked if we had one
2014-09-01 16:34:53	@relsqui	I could do either
2014-09-01 16:34:57	@relsqui	I wouldn't mind the excuse to buy packs, honestly
2014-09-01 16:34:58	@relsqui	lol

2014-09-01 16:35:20	@mancat	i havent' asked sean if he's gonna be interested in going to game night or not
2014-09-01 16:35:26	 *	mancat knows not this song

2014-09-01 16:35:58	 *	aliaras should really see what she's doing and make like, plans
2014-09-01 16:36:03	aliaras	relsqui: i land friday afternoon
2014-09-01 16:36:06	@relsqui	ah okay
2014-09-01 16:36:08	@relsqui	we'll be in santa cruz
2014-09-01 16:36:24	@relsqui	it sounds like we are prrrrrobably just missing each other
2014-09-01 16:36:36	@mancat	some of my other friends know i'm gonna be in sc by the way, so i'm probably gonna have a horde descend upon me friday evening, whatever we're doing
2014-09-01 16:36:42	@relsqui	hee
2014-09-01 16:36:44	@relsqui	I can deal with that
2014-09-01 16:36:48	@mancat	doing FNM in SC might be the best thing
2014-09-01 16:36:49	@dom	mancat be like "don't find me your shitty pop references" and I'm like "What, I can't hear yoi over the anesome music"
2014-09-01 16:36:58	@mancat	but i would feel bad for dot, two days of magic in a row
2014-09-01 16:37:03	@mancat	is kind of a lot
2014-09-01 16:37:07	@mancat	so maybe something not FNM
2014-09-01 16:37:08	@relsqui	yeah, I kinda figure we'd do one or the other
2014-09-01 16:37:15	@mancat	FNM isn't really actually good social interaction anyway
2014-09-01 16:37:21	aliaras	depending on plans/cars i could maybe make it up anyways
2014-09-01 16:37:23	@mancat	so maybe not that
2014-09-01 16:37:24	aliaras	but east bay hrrrgh
2014-09-01 16:37:48	@mancat	aliaras: if it's easier and preferable you could come to Santa Cruz and hang out with us and my friends on Friday
2014-09-01 16:37:55	aliaras	nah, not really
2014-09-01 16:37:58	@mancat	kk

2014-09-01 16:40:02	@relsqui	it's not so much that there has been a massive overhauling change in my life since then
2014-09-01 16:40:06	@relsqui	as that there have been, like, three

2014-09-01 16:43:14	@relsqui	grows a cravat
2014-09-01 16:43:27	@mancat	that's actually much more accurate

2014-09-01 16:43:32	@dom	I can fix that too
2014-09-01 16:43:38	@relsqui	I would like to see you in a cravat

2014-09-01 16:46:27	@relsqui	not sure if disappointed or even more amused
2014-09-01 16:46:57	@relsqui	mancat: there's still the show on friday. but it's money and maybe not great for a crowd of people
2014-09-01 16:47:48	@relsqui	... where do you go in santa cruz to just fuck around with a bunch of people
2014-09-01 16:47:49	@relsqui	beach?

2014-09-01 16:48:36	@relsqui	dom: btw I told ubiquill that you moved to portland for the weather
2014-09-01 16:48:42	@relsqui	and she's like "I've been considering moving to alaska for the weather"
2014-09-01 16:48:48	@relsqui	(ubiquill == portland native)
2014-09-01 16:48:55	@dom	Im considering moving back to alaska for the weather
2014-09-01 16:49:01	@dom	well, not just that
2014-09-01 16:49:05	@dom	but I miss the snow

2014-09-01 17:02:48	Golem	dom: so you are still here?  The frigid north has ceased its call?  Or is it still up in the air?
2014-09-01 17:03:41	@dom	im in the midwest right now, but I will be back on wednesday
2014-09-01 17:03:59	@dom	(for the rest of the term, at least)
2014-09-01 17:04:30	Golem	I will welcome you back with open cards
2014-09-01 17:04:36	@relsqui	haha awww <3
2014-09-01 17:05:59	Golem	No no, you dont understand.  Our opening hands will be brutal.  There will be an exchange of magic that will make the skies tremble.  Monsters and wizards will be summoned and destroyed, till naught is left of us but two pair of smoking boots by our chairs.
2014-09-01 17:06:10	Golem	Then we take turn 2.
2014-09-01 17:06:37	Golem	(also happy to hear you will be with us a while longer ^_^)

2014-09-01 17:24:04	Golem	Ye gods im sad I missed PAX again.  Aqu Inc looks amazing ;p
2014-09-01 17:25:02	@relsqui	I'm not sad I missed pax, just that I missed the magic party, lol
2014-09-01 17:35:10	@relsqui	hahaha TIL a Magic proverb I hadn't heard before and is instantly obviously true
2014-09-01 17:36:01	@relsqui	from the comments here http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/96403730433/the-ask-about-the-fetchlands-being-ugly-was-about
2014-09-01 17:39:51	Golem	Have you ever been to pax relsqui?
2014-09-01 17:42:12	@relsqui	I haven't.
2014-09-01 17:42:34	@relsqui	and unless something changes pretty publicly I'm not planning to give a significant amount of money to Penny Arcade :)
2014-09-01 17:42:48	Golem	then I will not spoil it with my poor descriptions.  Suffice to say I call it the "Gamer's Mecca" and I dont feel thats much of an exageration
2014-09-01 17:43:02	@relsqui	that's great for gamers then :P
2014-09-01 17:43:14	@dom	whats wrong with penny arcade?
2014-09-01 17:43:19	Golem	Thou art a gamer.   A tabletop gamer.
2014-09-01 17:43:23	Golem	Which they also cater too
2014-09-01 17:43:40	@relsqui	there's a couple, but I'll go with "unapologetic transphobia"
2014-09-01 17:43:50	@relsqui	since it's one of the most straightforward
2014-09-01 17:44:27	@relsqui	I forget which of the guys actually actively acts like a douchebag and which one just doesn't do anything about it, I'm not super familiar with the company
2014-09-01 17:44:51	Golem	Wait, so do you even have an incident to cite?
2014-09-01 17:45:02	@relsqui	but they've really strongly come down on the side of not supporting or respecting women and trans fans and gamers
2014-09-01 17:45:08	@relsqui	Golem: I can go dig it up if you really need me to
2014-09-01 17:45:21	@relsqui	but I'm doing something else so I'd rather not right now
2014-09-01 17:45:26	@relsqui	I'm sure you can find it if you want it
2014-09-01 17:45:28	Golem	There are many sins of penny arcade, but thats not one I recall.  I will look it up myself
2014-09-01 17:45:54	@relsqui	I'm also not really interested in arguing with people who feel defensive about it. not because it's not okay to feel defensive, it just doesn't sound like a fun or worthwhile interaction to have
2014-09-01 17:46:38	@dom	can't find much except from shit like jezebel
2014-09-01 17:47:14	@relsqui	if you want we can just pretend that I dislike them for some other reason and you don't have to defend them
2014-09-01 17:47:19	@relsqui	and we both go on living our lives
2014-09-01 17:47:51	@dom	im not defending them, I dont care about them either way
2014-09-01 17:48:47	@relsqui	man I had too many of those donuts
2014-09-01 17:49:00	@relsqui	by a number about .5 smaller than how many I have had
2014-09-01 17:49:39	@dom	ugh twitter is an insane media
2014-09-01 17:49:55	@dom	yes its good for keeping track of things, because its essentially masstexting
2014-09-01 17:49:58	@relsqui	truth
2014-09-01 17:50:02	@dom	but it means too much emotion is put into everything
2014-09-01 17:50:05	@dom	because its so quick
2014-09-01 17:50:09	@relsqui	heh
2014-09-01 17:50:11	@relsqui	too much for what?
2014-09-01 17:50:21	@dom	the internet lowers your barriers for politeness
2014-09-01 17:50:27	@relsqui	that's true
2014-09-01 17:50:27	@dom	and twitter gives you a way to lash out
2014-09-01 17:50:42	@relsqui	I'm not sure it's not good for us to actually admit we have feelings a little more
2014-09-01 17:50:50	@relsqui	like, yeah, there's also bad shit I don't want to see happen
2014-09-01 17:50:54	@relsqui	bullying etc.
2014-09-01 17:51:06	@relsqui	but I'm okay with the veneer of everything being okay wearing off a little bit
2014-09-01 17:51:23	@relsqui	(stoicism is overrated)
2014-09-01 17:51:25	@dom	no, I mean that people can post without thinking about it
2014-09-01 17:51:44	@dom	its like speaking to thousands of people at once
2014-09-01 17:51:48	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-01 17:52:01	@relsqui	yeah, granted I guess. it's an interesting thing about language that until very recently it was inherently ephemeral
2014-09-01 17:52:17	@relsqui	and we haven't quite figured out how to deal with the fact that it's not any more
2014-09-01 17:52:34	Golem	Another issue with twitter is that it has very little room to speak.  So its difficult to make detailed explanations and easy to make delcarative statements
2014-09-01 17:52:59	@relsqui	yeah, it's not really a place for nuance
2014-09-01 17:53:08	@relsqui	or you could do like a friend of mine did early and just spend 20 tweets exploring a subject in detail
2014-09-01 17:53:14	@relsqui	which, like, I'm not even going to engage with
2014-09-01 17:53:17	@relsqui	because twitter's UI is so terrible
2014-09-01 17:53:20	Golem	lol
2014-09-01 17:53:41	@dom	twitter just seems like its built to support flamebait from its very core
2014-09-01 17:53:50	Golem	Oh my yes.
2014-09-01 17:54:06	Golem	Its like the old utube voting system
2014-09-01 17:54:16	@relsqui	heh. including in that it actively refuses to deal with reports of abuse and harassment
2014-09-01 17:54:21	Golem	it doesnt matter weather you tweet positive or negaative, you are just drawing more attention
2014-09-01 17:54:29	@relsqui	("so I'm getting death threats from this account" "you should probably stop provoking them")
2014-09-01 17:54:36	Golem	yup
2014-09-01 17:54:44	@relsqui	which is, needless to say, disappointing
2014-09-01 17:55:08	@dom	its like being in a giant conversation, where everyone can speak
2014-09-01 17:55:15	@dom	only everyone means literally everyone
2014-09-01 17:55:22	Golem	Althoug at this point if they did do that, they would have to ban half their user base im pretty sure
2014-09-01 17:55:47	@relsqui	Golem: I'd be okay with that :P
2014-09-01 17:55:51	@dom	the only reason Im not advocating for the removal of twitter is that its useful for mass news from organizations
2014-09-01 17:55:55	@relsqui	because it doesn't include any of the ones I care about >_>
2014-09-01 17:56:06	@dom	ie: theres some fire and shit on this and this street, back the fuck up
2014-09-01 17:56:15	@relsqui	dom: also from *not* organizations
2014-09-01 17:56:27	@dom	yes, which is why I dont like it
2014-09-01 17:56:32	Golem	my point being as a buisness they wont be inclined unless there is a better alternative
2014-09-01 17:56:44	@dom	sure
2014-09-01 17:56:49	Golem	or a worse concequence
2014-09-01 17:56:53	@relsqui	itt capitalism is bullshit
2014-09-01 17:56:56	@relsqui	:P
2014-09-01 17:57:13	Golem	What i DO think is that holders of the twitter accounts should have the right to ban people from commenting on their feeds
2014-09-01 17:57:13	@dom	no, its not even capitalism
2014-09-01 17:57:24	@dom	I dont like the users of twitter, I dont mind the platform
2014-09-01 17:57:28	@dom	since it can be used for good
2014-09-01 17:58:29	@relsqui	Golem: I mean, they do?
2014-09-01 17:58:33	@relsqui	I'm not sure what you mean
2014-09-01 17:58:49	@relsqui	dom: yeah, but the user base is related to the policies of the company, which are driven by its incentives
2014-09-01 17:58:51	Golem	If they do, I havent seen people use them
2014-09-01 17:59:35	@relsqui	you can ban people, I'm not totally clear on what exactly it does
2014-09-01 17:59:47	@dom	twitter is big enough that its user base is related to the platform, and has nothing to do with the company
2014-09-01 18:00:03	@dom	yes blah blah people will stop using something if the company is evil, but not enough
2014-09-01 18:00:21	Golem	thats not true at all
2014-09-01 18:00:29	Golem	people will stop using something when they have something clearly better
2014-09-01 18:00:43	Golem	evil is just one more turd on the shit pile.
2014-09-01 18:00:49	@dom	yes, and twitter is one of the best ways to start flame wars right now
2014-09-01 18:00:57	Golem	exxcaaacccttltllyyyy
2014-09-01 18:10:48	@relsqui	a friend of mine posted this https://twitter.com/outofsequences/status/506514834218049536 and I just saw the middle of it in a square thumbnail thing on my feed
2014-09-01 18:10:51	@relsqui	so I sent back http://magiccards.info/scans/en/m15/126.jpg

2014-09-03 11:50:21	aliaras	does it die?
2014-09-03 13:10:17	magic	yes, protection only makes it untargetable and take no damage
2014-09-03 13:10:55	magic	also unblockable by
2014-09-03 13:32:01	aliaras	got it
2014-09-03 14:54:46	Golem	A bit late, but generally speaking its good to know what protection DOES.
2014-09-03 14:55:46	Golem	It doesnt prevent the creature from being destroyed or sacraficed, for example.  It doesnt prevent the creature from getting counters placed on it.  Anything not specified by the ability is free game.

2014-09-03 22:44:34	@dom	rakshasa vizier is like "LOL anafenza, you silly"
2014-09-03 22:46:14	@dom	why is abzan the best clan
2014-09-03 22:51:23	Golem	bleh
2014-09-03 22:51:32	Golem	RV is still just a 4/4 for 5 that MIGHT get bigger
2014-09-03 22:51:54	Golem	Even if it does get huge, no hexproof, no trample, dies to removal.....
2014-09-03 22:52:04	Golem	for 5 mana and 3 colors I was expecting better
2014-09-03 22:52:50	@dom	yeah I looked at the cost after
2014-09-03 22:52:57	@dom	most of this stuff looks unplayable, honestly
2014-09-03 22:53:17	@dom	the stuff in theros looks downright quick compared to most of whats been revealed
2014-09-03 22:53:24	Golem	the ascensions, that 4/4 for 3, and sarkhan so far
2014-09-03 22:53:30	Golem	those look fine
2014-09-03 22:53:35	Golem	everything else is kinda....eh
2014-09-03 22:53:36	@dom	yeah, not everything is terrible
2014-09-03 22:53:36	Golem	and yeah
2014-09-03 22:53:46	@dom	theres a 6/6 trample hexproof for 6
2014-09-03 22:53:53	@dom	which isn't *awful*
2014-09-03 22:53:58	Golem	when your set is making THEROS look more interesting.....im a tad worried
2014-09-03 22:54:08	Golem	still, 200 more cards to go
2014-09-03 22:54:19	@dom	yeah
2014-09-03 22:54:28	@dom	theros the set wasn't too bad, tbh
2014-09-03 22:54:32	@dom	theros the block though
2014-09-03 22:54:36	Golem	bleh
2014-09-03 22:54:42	Golem	yar I feel ya
2014-09-03 22:54:59	@dom	sagu mauler is the 6/6
2014-09-03 22:55:08	@dom	it has morph, but no good morph thing, so im ignoring it
2014-09-03 22:55:22	@dom	it is in simic colors, so itll probably get at least a little play
2014-09-03 22:55:45	@dom	ankle shanker is a big disappointment
2014-09-03 22:56:06	Golem	yar...its like...yeah, it makes combat difficult for your opponent
2014-09-03 22:56:10	Golem	thats great
2014-09-03 22:56:25	@dom	"you can swing with your team this time, cuz it has haste"
2014-09-03 22:56:28	Golem	but they can kill it, and even if they dont kill it, they can ignore it
2014-09-03 22:56:33	@dom	yes
2014-09-03 22:56:47	@dom	also, its a 5 mana goblin in 3 colors
2014-09-03 22:56:51	@dom	thats pretty bad
2014-09-03 22:56:58	Golem	A control deck is going to kill everything you play anyways.  An aggro deck is much faster than a 5 mana creature can deal with
2014-09-03 22:57:16	Golem	midrange decks will have issues....IF they care about your creatures attacking
2014-09-03 22:57:22	Golem	if they dont, you are boned
2014-09-03 22:57:24	@dom	yeah
2014-09-03 22:57:46	@dom	its like... why did you make this set so slow when you just printed rabblemaster and a lot of fast red in theros and m15?
2014-09-03 22:58:21	Golem	Why does your 6 mana guildmaster die to a courser of cruphix?
2014-09-03 22:58:44	Golem	bleh
2014-09-03 22:59:08	Golem	Hmm, there is some new stuff up
2014-09-03 22:59:18	Golem	lol flying crane technice
2014-09-03 22:59:20	Golem	thats cute
2014-09-03 22:59:47	Golem	Oooh, look at wingmate roc
2014-09-03 22:59:54	Golem	thats somethign worth looking at
2014-09-03 23:00:26	@dom	flying crane technique is "LOL, I hope you win this swing"
2014-09-03 23:00:45	Golem	Its a decent ambush card as well
2014-09-03 23:00:52	@dom	yeah
2014-09-03 23:00:58	@dom	wingmate roc is decent
2014-09-03 23:01:01	@dom	but its also 5 mana
2014-09-03 23:01:03	Golem	but again, its all based around big creature stalls, and they printed a new wrath
2014-09-03 23:01:08	@dom	yeah
2014-09-03 23:01:20	Golem	well so was baneslayer, and archangel of thune, but both of those saw a ton of play
2014-09-03 23:01:24	@dom	sure
2014-09-03 23:01:30	Golem	this seems in the same vein as those
2014-09-03 23:01:40	@dom	it is 5 mana for 2 3/4s, so thats not too bad
2014-09-03 23:01:43	Golem	yar
2014-09-03 23:01:45	@dom	w/ flying
2014-09-03 23:01:56	Golem	and the life gain on attacks is good on offense or defense
2014-09-03 23:02:22	Golem	or rather, it allows you to play offense while defending
2014-09-03 23:02:31	@dom	its kinda meh for offense, imo, but they could easily see play as a finisher in a controld eck
2014-09-03 23:02:43	Golem	A control deck thats attacking with something?
2014-09-03 23:02:52	@dom	well, they have to win sometime
2014-09-03 23:03:30	Golem	true
2014-09-03 23:03:32	@dom	I could see roc in the same deck as nyxfleece ram
2014-09-03 23:03:34	@dom	how about that
2014-09-03 23:03:39	Golem	lol
2014-09-03 23:03:43	Golem	I attack you for 0
2014-09-03 23:03:48	Golem	RAAIAIIDDDD ROOOCCCCSSSS
2014-09-03 23:03:52	@dom	I've done that
2014-09-03 23:03:53	@dom	with ram
2014-09-03 23:04:07	@dom	with uhhh
2014-09-03 23:04:11	@dom	whats that fleet card
2014-09-03 23:04:15	@dom	unleash the fleets?
2014-09-03 23:04:18	@dom	launch the fleets?
2014-09-03 23:04:42	@dom	!card launch the fleet

2014-09-03 23:04:58	@dom	was playing a token deck that for some reason had nyxfleece ram in it
2014-09-03 23:05:08	@dom	had 3 on field, cast launch the fleet for value, swung
2014-09-03 23:05:11	Golem	nice
2014-09-03 23:05:12	@dom	made 3 little dudes
2014-09-03 23:05:33	@dom	oh I remmeber
2014-09-03 23:05:45	@dom	its the purphuros deck I made, thats just purphuros and tokens
2014-09-03 23:06:01	@dom	ram helps me stay alive, since its derpy and has no control mechanisms
2014-09-03 23:06:06	Golem	lol
2014-09-03 23:06:17	Golem	RUG Chord with token mechanics is likely to be a thing
2014-09-03 23:06:45	Golem	All it needs is a replacement for young pyromancer in some way
2014-09-03 23:07:10	@dom	I'd do RWG tokens myself
2014-09-03 23:07:24	@dom	!card raise the alarm

2014-09-03 23:08:16	Golem	mmm
2014-09-03 23:09:31	@dom	plus elspeth
2014-09-03 23:09:56	@dom	I dont like triplicate spirits as it really only helps when you're winning
2014-09-03 23:09:56	Golem	You make good points
2014-09-03 23:10:05	Golem	and yes, that was my take on it
2014-09-03 23:10:05	@dom	but raise the alarm is bomb-diggity
2014-09-03 23:10:12	Golem	always has been ^_^
2014-09-03 23:10:25	@dom	launch the fleet is a better triplicate spirits imo
2014-09-03 23:10:39	@dom	(as you can cast it and then attack with it, also, its cheaper)
2014-09-03 23:10:44	@dom	but it doesn't make flying mans
2014-09-03 23:11:15	@dom	but i'd play w just for launch the fleets and raise the alarm, they are good for tokens
2014-09-03 23:11:26	@dom	elspeth is also playable, though probably a little expensive
2014-09-03 23:12:23	Golem	mm
2014-09-03 23:12:35	Golem	if you are playing green, you could potentially get it out earlier
2014-09-03 23:12:40	@dom	very true
2014-09-03 23:12:43	Golem	so thats a lesser issue
2014-09-03 23:12:49	@dom	also, her -3 is a big fuck you to that one clan
2014-09-03 23:12:53	Golem	lol
2014-09-03 23:12:55	Golem	poor temur
2014-09-03 23:13:16	@dom	I just dont like that she is 6 mana for a 4 loyalty walker
2014-09-03 23:13:20	Golem	if they dont get somethign along the lines of a grull rampager they are gonna be up the creek without the pattle
2014-09-03 23:13:22	@dom	but green is ramp and ramp is life
2014-09-03 23:13:38	@dom	ghorclan rampager reprint would be awesome lol
2014-09-03 23:13:48	Golem	when she has 2 ways to protect herself right off the bat, her loyalty is largely irrelivant
2014-09-03 23:13:54	@dom	"this is now a mainstay, like wraths and counterspells. print it every block"
2014-09-03 23:13:58	Golem	lol
2014-09-03 23:14:00	Golem	yes plz
2014-09-03 23:14:53	@dom	yeah I'd play elspeth in that deck
2014-09-03 23:15:08	@dom	w/ purphuros its 6 damage every turn
2014-09-03 23:15:20	@dom	but if yo have out purphuros as a token deck, you basically already won
2014-09-03 23:15:26	@dom	well
2014-09-03 23:15:31	@dom	if you still have fuel too
2014-09-03 23:15:40	Golem	yup
2014-09-03 23:15:44	@dom	your opponent has to have seriously fucked up though
2014-09-03 23:57:53	@dom	kheru spellthief isn't great but its interesting
2014-09-04 06:14:30	aliaras	Elspeth in a token deck is v. playable
2014-09-04 06:14:55	aliaras	I actually took Launch the Fleet out for...something else, because I found it either expensive or unworkable
2014-09-04 06:14:59	aliaras	unless I had triplicate spirits out
2014-09-04 06:15:40	aliaras	because it would take little mans -> more little mans, but if the opponent had blockers, it usually wasn't valuable
2014-09-04 06:15:43	aliaras	i just ended up with tapped dudes
2014-09-04 06:15:50	aliaras	as opposed to tapping dudes to convoke bigger dudes out
2014-09-04 06:15:53	aliaras	which was always better
2014-09-04 06:16:22	aliaras	also the baller move with triplicate spirits (that makes it good) is if you can get it out on turn 3
2014-09-04 06:16:52	aliaras	turn 1: land, 1-drop, go. turn 2: plains, go (raise the alarm on end step). turn 3: land, tap errybody, triplicate spirits
2014-09-04 06:16:55	aliaras	BOOSH
2014-09-04 06:18:43	aliaras	turn 4: paragon, spear of heliod, anything else to +1/+1 your little dudes
2014-09-04 06:18:48	aliaras	now swinging for 6 in the air
2014-09-04 06:20:18	aliaras	turn 5: sanctified charge, I win nao
2014-09-04 11:49:50	@dom	oh man enter the infinite and borborygmos enraged
2014-09-04 11:50:07	@dom	it wont ever happen unless you're running like 12 fog effects and some wraths for good measure
2014-09-04 11:50:13	@dom	but that shit would be hilarious
2014-09-04 11:50:48	@dom	wincon: "I throw my deck at you for 36 damage, responses?"
2014-09-04 11:54:13	aliaras	'kek'
2014-09-04 11:56:12	@dom	"I kek for value, responses?"
2014-09-04 11:56:26	@dom	OK I gotta go and do shit today no more lying around
2014-09-04 11:56:33	aliaras	glhf!
2014-09-04 11:56:40	aliaras	I'm gonna go home and do shit which isn't "play with magic cards
2014-09-04 11:56:41	aliaras	"
2014-09-04 11:56:45	aliaras	altho I lost super hard at that at lunch

2014-09-05 22:24:55	@dom	a playable card?!
2014-09-05 22:24:58	@dom	OMG

2014-09-06 13:09:58	@dom	mana
2014-09-06 13:10:11	@dom	lots of speculation about maybe getting vivid lands and the worldwake manlands
2014-09-06 13:10:55	@dom	speculation because those lands fit the holes of the lands that haven't been revealed, no actual basis
2014-09-06 15:34:50	aliaras	dom: how good are said sleeves?
2014-09-06 15:35:26	aliaras	also i'd imagine you need the fixing for the three color decks
2014-09-06 15:44:04	@dom	dragon shield is commonly thought to be best of the best for what money can buy
2014-09-06 15:44:34	@dom	aliaras: yeah thats the idea, wotc has said alara is painful to play limited because of the lack of fixing
2014-09-06 15:45:33	aliaras	yeah
2014-09-06 15:45:53	aliaras	i wonder how it'll be in standard
2014-09-06 15:48:11	@dom	im hoping for vivid lands
2014-09-06 15:48:15	@dom	I would be so happy
2014-09-06 17:28:57	aliaras	whassat?

2014-09-06 22:28:24	aliaras	next two games resolved him and he stuck tho
2014-09-06 22:28:29	aliaras	:3
2014-09-06 22:29:12	aliaras	allllllmost ulted garruk then cast In Garruk's Wake, for max style points
2014-09-06 22:29:54	aliaras	but i fished up a revoker instead so if opponent tried to stabilize with ajani it wouldn't have happened
2014-09-06 22:30:23	 *	aliaras was toodling around with an "i have these cards!" green black deck

2014-09-07 13:04:35	aliaras	was an esper control variant I hadn't seen before
2014-09-07 13:16:03	aliaras	used mass calcify as a not-at-all one-sided wrath (as i had mostly green dudes out)
2014-09-07 13:16:05	aliaras	NO REGRETS
2014-09-07 13:17:20	aliaras	bounced two guys with primadox leading up to it, had a 1/1 white soldier token in play, and opponent had a siege dragon out
2014-09-07 13:26:05	aliaras	(different game)

2014-09-08 22:59:09	@relsqui	I haven't evaluated whether it's good, I'm saying it's cool :P
2014-09-08 23:12:48	@relsqui	"Fun fact: Meandering Towershell's playtest name was Turtle McDurdle." now I like it even more

2014-09-09 00:00:10	@relsqui	wth tabak
2014-09-09 00:04:53	@dom	yeah, they're also fun and popular
2014-09-09 00:05:09	@dom	but they'd be killed instantly if they didn't serve a purpose mechanically :P
2014-09-09 00:05:30	@dom	it gives people something to reach out to and embrace
2014-09-09 00:05:50	@relsqui	well, yeah
2014-09-09 00:05:51	@relsqui	for sure
2014-09-09 00:06:01	@relsqui	but if they served a purpose mechanically and weren't fun or popular they'd die :)
2014-09-09 00:07:08	@dom	sure, but mechanics would be held in higher regard than popularity

2014-09-09 23:39:47	karmabot	comp rules(2): basically everything else is, though (205.3m), you can't use Redirect to make a counterspell target itself, but making it target the Redirect that's redirecting it is totally legit (114.4, 608.2k), if you manage to make an Aura enchant itself, the game will take it away and glare at you as a state-based action (303.4d), if the spell doesn't need targets you don't have to pick any (700.2c), you can't put one card in two piles (700.3a),
2014-09-09 23:39:47	karmabot	stop hitting yourself! lol (701.10c), if regeneration of a permanent is prevented, you can pay for it anyway if you want to (701.12c), you can't sacrifice someone else's creature (701.14a), templating is really important (701.15e), shuffling an empy library is still shuffling it (701.16f), you can't tap something that's tapped (701.17a)

2014-09-10 12:37:11	@relsqui	why is pyramids ten dollars
2014-09-10 12:37:17	Golem	its an old card
2014-09-10 12:37:19	Golem	and rare
2014-09-10 12:37:24	@mancat	and reserved list
2014-09-10 12:37:28	@mancat	so collector price
2014-09-10 12:37:30	@relsqui	ah
2014-09-10 12:37:30	Golem	really?
2014-09-10 12:37:35	Golem	they reserved that
2014-09-10 12:37:35	@mancat	yep
2014-09-10 12:37:36	Golem	lol
2014-09-10 12:37:41	@mancat	they didn't reserve cards by power
2014-09-10 12:37:46	Golem	yeah I suppose
2014-09-10 12:37:47	@mancat	they reserved all rares of a certain age
2014-09-10 12:38:30	@relsqui	speaking of regen I'm kinda pleased at figuring out I can regen grave-troll just to pull its counters and put it back in the yard where it belongs
2014-09-10 12:38:34	@relsqui	to kickstart dredge
2014-09-10 12:38:40	@relsqui	maybe that's obvious, I dunno, but I hadn't thought of it before yesterday
2014-09-10 12:39:00	Golem	im not sure I follow
2014-09-10 12:39:07	Golem	if you want it in the gy, why regenerate it
2014-09-10 12:39:15	@relsqui	!card golgari grave-troll
2014-09-10 12:39:15	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-09-10 12:39:28	@relsqui	Golem: because it's a 0/0 that regens by removing its own +1/+1 counters
2014-09-10 12:39:33	@relsqui	that's the cost
2014-09-10 12:39:35	Golem	yessssssss?
2014-09-10 12:39:40	@mancat	the cost to regen is "1, remove s +1/+1 counter from CARDNAME:"
2014-09-10 12:39:51	Golem	ok?
2014-09-10 12:39:52	@relsqui	Golem: so when I remove the last one, it dies to state
2014-09-10 12:39:55	@relsqui	regen doesn't save it
2014-09-10 12:39:55	@mancat	^
2014-09-10 12:40:06	Golem	So you are dodgeing an oblivion ring or something?
2014-09-10 12:40:15	@mancat	no, you're throwing a dredge card in the graveyard
2014-09-10 12:40:18	@relsqui	Golem: no, I'm putting ... that
2014-09-10 12:40:21	Golem	ahh I seee
2014-09-10 12:40:27	Golem	you are just killing it using its own ability
2014-09-10 12:40:29	@relsqui	yes.
2014-09-10 12:40:35	Golem	heh
2014-09-10 12:40:37	Golem	Neat
2014-09-10 12:40:40	@relsqui	right?
2014-09-10 12:40:45	@relsqui	it only works really early
2014-09-10 12:40:53	@relsqui	but it was good for the situation I had, with one creature in the yard and grave-troll in my hand
2014-09-10 12:41:03	@relsqui	the less dumb version would've been to play the creatures in the opposite order
2014-09-10 12:41:12	@relsqui	wait until turn five, drop the troll, let it die to state, then play the splinterfright
2014-09-10 12:41:28	@relsqui	but given that I fucked it up already it was a good fallback
2014-09-10 12:41:38	Golem	noted
2014-09-10 12:41:41	@relsqui	also I had all the time in the world since mancat was sitting across the table playing magic with himself
2014-09-10 12:41:46	Golem	lol
2014-09-10 12:41:46	@relsqui	read: playing his cumulative upkeep deck
2014-09-10 12:42:39	Golem	lol, I was right.  Pyramids was printed in arabian nights, about half a year before the first man land (mishra's factory) was printed in antiquites
2014-09-10 12:42:48	Golem	and a full four years before stalking stones
2014-09-10 12:42:50	Golem	><
2014-09-10 12:43:14	Golem	I suppose it stops stone rain but still 0_o
2014-09-10 12:43:42	Golem	argh
2014-09-10 12:44:18	Golem	my brain is like a bunch of accountaints grinding away at old typewriters trying to figure out what use that card would have, and its failing >.<
2014-09-10 12:44:27	@relsqui	hahaha

2014-09-11 17:08:50	@dom	and meaningless rest
2014-09-11 17:08:55	@dom	and his cost was R
2014-09-11 17:09:11	@dom	was thinking that might not be so bad and then I remembered real tibalt is not that >>
2014-09-11 17:11:05	@relsqui	lol
2014-09-11 17:11:21	@dom	then tibalt would read "PLAY THIS IN DREDGE"
2014-09-11 17:11:40	@dom	or "EVERY GY DECK IS NOW B/r/*"
2014-09-11 17:14:56	@relsqui	> "Colons indicate activated abilities." Does this mean that the names of Circles of Protection are activated abilities? :)

2014-09-11 20:19:15	aliaras	so sad
2014-09-12 01:11:36	@dom	aliaras: I wish you could be here to prerelease with us :(
2014-09-12 01:11:55	@dom	if we find a 4th, we can go I think, since it looks like a 2HG event @ TV
2014-09-12 01:12:12	@dom	at least, I think me mancat and relsqui are planning on going
2014-09-12 13:54:19	@relsqui	I mean we should go regardless :P any pairs that wanna 2hg can 2hg, and anyone else can sealed
2014-09-12 13:55:33	@relsqui	dom: I wanna go, I think mancat is still settling his plans
2014-09-12 14:02:43	@mancat	right nwo it looks like i'm planning to go
2014-09-12 14:02:45	@mancat	nothing else has ocme up

2014-09-12 15:08:42	Golem	I would like to go.  I have a lead on a job, and if that goes through I will likely join you if my schedule allows.
2014-09-12 15:09:54	@relsqui	sweet
2014-09-12 15:09:56	@relsqui	good luck
2014-09-12 15:13:43	Golem	thanks ^_^
2014-09-12 16:31:32	@dom	Ponyback brigade: lol
2014-09-12 16:31:43	@dom	its the summon 3 goblins with a 2/2 as well
2014-09-12 16:46:43	@dom	(I think they spoiled the rest of khans, or at least a large majority)
2014-09-12 16:47:24	@dom	(new act of treason art)++
2014-09-12 16:48:09	@dom	defiant strike could be part of my boros heroic deck
2014-09-12 16:48:15	@dom	since it cantrips for 1 white :)
2014-09-12 17:00:18	@dom	Golem: if you go we can make-a da team
2014-09-12 17:09:56	Golem	dom: we will be the most timmy-tastic team
2014-09-12 17:15:38	@dom	Golem: I'm way more of a spike and a johnny
2014-09-12 17:16:26	@dom	timmy is only a means to an end
2014-09-12 17:16:28	@dom	:P
2014-09-12 17:16:53	Golem	dom: Then I will handle the timmying, you can handle the johnnying, and there will be enough spike between us to ride heard on them (hopefully)

2014-09-13 01:41:39	Golem	for some reason I keep flipping those two
2014-09-13 02:00:30	Golem	But yeah, so far the good decks I have seen are 1, Temur Green Devotion, 2 Azban Midrage/Walkers, and Jund Walkers.
2014-09-13 02:00:50	Golem	Havent played against any mono-red aggro or anything resembling a control deck yet.
2014-09-13 02:01:06	Golem	Not sure if there is a control deck that can handle those 3 reliably yet, but its possible
2014-09-13 02:22:23	@dom	yeah, I think big green is just super good

2014-09-13 22:41:49	Golem	havent seen anyone give it a try yet, but a 3/3 flyer, 4/4 trampler, unconditional kill spell, and a draw 3 sorcery all for (potentially) 1 mana seems solid.
2014-09-13 22:42:24	Golem	pluss they are green, so they have access to chord of calling for tutoring and sididdididisisisisisi for filling the gy and zombies
2014-09-13 22:42:53	Golem	I suspect how good it is will depend on how fast it can fill the gy reliably and what support spells they choose to use.
2014-09-13 22:43:17	@relsqui	I'ma find out
2014-09-13 22:43:19	@relsqui	next weekend

2014-09-13 22:45:34	Golem	Oh dom, I will be attending the prerelease (or at least I intend to, need to look and see if they require pregistration) if you still wanted to team up

2014-09-14 06:42:15	aliaras	but
2014-09-14 06:42:25	aliaras	if i take 0 damage from a deathtoucher do i die?

2014-09-14 07:47:10	oracle	Artifact — Equipment, 1 (1)
2014-09-14 07:47:10	oracle	If a source would deal damage to equipped creature, prevent X of that damage, where X is the number of creatures you control.
2014-09-14 07:47:10	oracle	Equip {2} ({2}: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)
2014-09-14 07:47:20	aliaras	^ this card is doing *work* for me
2014-09-14 07:47:45	aliaras	even for small X it's great and it counts each individually
2014-09-14 07:48:11	aliaras	so if i have a 1/1 with it equipped, blocked by a bunch of 1/*s, the 1/1 survives
2014-09-14 09:24:45	@relsqui	aliaras: nope. something that would deal 0 damage does not deal damage
2014-09-14 09:24:53	@relsqui	therefore not enough to be fatal even for a deathtoucher
2014-09-14 09:28:56	@relsqui	also I assume that when you say "I" there you're speaking from the perspective of a creature
2014-09-14 09:29:03	@relsqui	since players dgaf about deathtouch

2014-09-14 16:12:57	@relsqui	if you say "I just lost the game" during a game of magic can that be interpreted as a concession

2014-09-15 01:33:49	@dom	01:30 <@dom> im trying to make a good combo deck because I really don't want to keep building ghetto jank tribal
2014-09-15 01:33:53	@dom	01:30 <@dom> but I can't think of a card to build around
2014-09-15 02:20:03	aliaras	I can't think of one either but combo decks are fun
2014-09-15 02:21:29	@dom	im thinking of just doing more jank tribal instead

2014-09-15 02:30:28	@dom	the answer might just be "make even *jankier* tribal
2014-09-15 02:30:34	@dom	but I don't want to do that

2014-09-15 02:32:32	Golem	ok
2014-09-15 02:32:36	Golem	enough standard for a while
2014-09-15 02:33:40	Golem	Decks to beat in standard: Big green (with red and/or blue).  Black aggro (with red and/or white).  Naya planeswalkers (with Anger the Gods and possibly blue splash).
2014-09-15 02:33:59	@dom	and rabblered
2014-09-15 02:34:07	Golem	Havent seen much rabblered yet
2014-09-15 02:34:27	Golem	im sure its out there, but I have seen 1 deck using it thus far and it got trounced convincingly
2014-09-15 02:34:44	Golem	So i dunno
2014-09-15 02:34:54	Golem	could be black red aggro just consumes it

2014-09-15 02:35:50	@dom	rabblered is pretty popular on the tourney circuit, and it wont change much with rotation

2014-09-15 02:41:05	@dom	yah
2014-09-15 15:54:07	Golem	If there is a control deck, jeskai is a strong option.  Tested it out a bit earlier today and anger of the gods is (perhaps unsurprisingly) good against maru/black aggro, rabble red, and still passible agianst the accelerators of big green.  Also fairly amazing against sultai hyjinx, as it gets rid of most of their early plays AND exiles them to boot.
2014-09-15 15:54:29	@dom	yar
2014-09-15 15:54:35	 *	Golem must now consider Khans a good set, as he is spending far too much time testing it out

2014-09-15 15:56:26	@dom	yeah, I think it'll have to be boros to get some of the good 1 drops from white

2014-09-15 16:02:44	@dom	you can make sealed packs online with a generator

2014-09-15 16:04:40	Golem	and better than 90% are nice guys, or at least quiet whilst playing
2014-09-15 16:04:46	Golem	nice people I should say

2014-09-15 16:06:15	@dom	:P
2014-09-15 16:06:25	Golem	rabble red actually lost a fair bit, at least with the SCG version.  Looses BTE, Cackler, Legion Loyalist, Ash Zealot, Firefist Striker, And rubblebelt Maaka
2014-09-15 16:06:43	Golem	Some of those are easy replacements, like legion loyalist and cackler
2014-09-15 16:07:03	Golem	Others, like Maaka and Firefist, less so
2014-09-15 16:07:25	Golem	I suspect the strategy will stick around, but it may shift its color focus to black, who has the best aggressive drops right now
2014-09-15 16:07:37	@dom	I think it will have to splash, but it also keeps its power cards like rabblemaster and firedrinker
2014-09-15 16:07:48	@dom	and stoke the flames, etc
2014-09-15 16:07:53	@dom	it does lose mutavault
2014-09-15 16:08:01	@dom	I suspect it will be blackred, yeah
2014-09-15 16:08:11	Golem	yup, it needs a new creature package, and b/r has the best spells
2014-09-15 16:08:26	--	dom has changed topic for #mtg from "http://www.pdxmtg.com | http://magiccards.info/ Because knowing is half the battle! | /hilight mtgsignal | Get meeting alerts with time & location each week: http://cy.tl/1zs5uo5 | GRAND PRIX THIS WEEKEND let's go!" to "http://www.pdxmtg.com | http://magiccards.info/ Because knowing is half the battle! | /hilight mtgsignal | Get meeting alerts with time & location each week: http://cy.tl/1zs5uo5 | Add KTK to cockatrice! http://goo.gl/SmA1bh"
2014-09-15 16:08:29	Golem	the best versions I have seen thus far also splash white and go full mardu for the butcher
2014-09-15 16:08:40	@dom	thats more midrangey, I think
2014-09-15 16:08:44	Golem	eh
2014-09-15 16:09:00	Golem	he fits with the strategy of "play resiliant little dudes and attacl"
2014-09-15 16:09:18	@dom	here, let me edit one of my decks thats close to rabblered anyway, and we can test
2014-09-15 16:09:18	Golem	hes only 4 mana, so 2-3 and a purpherous is pretty standard
2014-09-15 16:09:36	Golem	ill hop over to the lounge, need to get off desk anyways
2014-09-15 16:09:42	@dom	im not in the lounge
2014-09-15 16:09:44	@dom	im at home
2014-09-15 16:10:14	@dom	(it would be over cockatrice)
2014-09-15 16:12:44	@dom	you think hordeling outburst is a 4-of? it synergizes with foundry street and rabblemaster
2014-09-15 16:14:08	Golem	mmm
2014-09-15 16:14:19	Golem	No strong feelings one way or the other yet
2014-09-15 16:14:23	@dom	yar
2014-09-15 16:14:28	@dom	I think you're right with butcher
2014-09-15 16:14:33	@dom	I didn't see you could give it haste
2014-09-15 16:14:34	Golem	its good, and I think its stock goes up the more red god you play
2014-09-15 16:14:37	Golem	yup
2014-09-15 16:14:38	@dom	and you'll have toikens
2014-09-15 16:14:42	Golem	its a nasty follow up to rabblemaster
2014-09-15 16:14:49	Golem	particularly if they have blockers
2014-09-15 16:14:56	@dom	yah
2014-09-15 16:14:56	Golem	also good with mardu ascendancy if you have that
2014-09-15 16:15:06	@dom	im thinking of playing it, yeah
2014-09-15 16:15:13	Golem	And if all that wasnt enough, works well with blood soaked champion too ^_^
2014-09-15 16:15:38	Golem	I am on cockatrice
2014-09-15 16:16:06	@dom	K play some with others, im still building
2014-09-15 16:16:29	Golem	I made a game, DOM IM HERE!.  Password is catsonly
2014-09-15 16:16:36	Golem	hmm
2014-09-15 16:24:31	@dom	chief of the edge?
2014-09-15 16:24:48	@dom	it affects champion, denizen, rabblemaster
2014-09-15 16:24:55	@dom	plus its a 3/2 for 2
2014-09-15 16:24:57	@dom	Im doing it
2014-09-15 16:25:00	Golem	go for it
2014-09-15 16:25:11	Golem	you could also put war-name asperant in there
2014-09-15 16:25:22	Golem	also an easy 3/2 for 2 with an upside, and a warrior
2014-09-15 16:25:31	Golem	as I recall
2014-09-15 16:26:22	@dom	yep
2014-09-15 16:26:39	@dom	it only affects other warriors, but it acts like a 2/2 that already has the effect
2014-09-15 16:26:44	@dom	I think this version will work
2014-09-15 16:27:15	Golem	Its also an edgewarrior
2014-09-15 16:27:15	@dom	im in the game
2014-09-15 16:27:20	@dom	edgewarrior?
2014-09-15 16:27:34	Golem	so edgy
2014-09-15 16:27:39	Golem	^_^
2014-09-15 16:27:42	@dom	>>
2014-09-15 16:27:44	@dom	omg
2014-09-15 16:27:54	Golem	Also, did someone else want to join?
2014-09-15 16:28:10	@dom	relsqui maybe, but I dont think so
2014-09-15 16:28:14	@dom	I think they're actually working
2014-09-15 16:28:15	@dom	lol
2014-09-15 16:28:15	@dom	kek
2014-09-15 16:28:22	Golem	Someone sent me an instant message, but i closed it by accidnet
2014-09-15 16:28:23	Golem	ah well
2014-09-15 16:28:28	@dom	oh oops
2014-09-15 16:28:30	@relsqui	not really, but I'm also not going to install cockatrice over here
2014-09-15 16:28:54	Golem	Probably a good idea ^_^
2014-09-15 16:29:16	@relsqui	idgaf if it's a good idea, it's just a pain in the ass
2014-09-15 16:29:29	@relsqui	re work I'm nominally working on club logo but it's also a pain in the ass so actually I'm not
2014-09-15 16:29:33	@relsqui	very much
2014-09-15 16:43:57	Golem	lol
2014-09-15 17:04:24	@dom	so mardu rabble red feels good, I think I need to run erase and banishing light in either board or main though
2014-09-15 17:06:23	@dom	reprisal is what I needed golem
2014-09-15 17:06:24	@dom	so good
2014-09-15 17:07:56	@dom	I feel like I need more fuel but I dont know what to run
2014-09-15 17:08:10	@dom	and its more just that I dont draw what I need when I need it >>
2014-09-15 17:11:08	@dom	relsqui: you can also draft via cockatrice
2014-09-15 17:11:15	@dom	I've never done it, but you can do it
2014-09-15 17:11:17	@relsqui	mm
2014-09-15 17:14:54	@dom	Golem: also not sure about purphuros
2014-09-15 17:14:59	@dom	I could never actually cast
2014-09-15 17:15:11	@dom	but it would help if I already had out mardu ascendancy
2014-09-15 17:15:14	@dom	or rabblemaster
2014-09-15 17:15:22	@dom	s/would help/would win game/
2014-09-15 17:28:51	Golem	yar
2014-09-15 17:29:00	Golem	its also a pump effect for all yoru little guys
2014-09-15 17:29:09	Golem	I would run 1 to start with and see how it feels when you can cast him
2014-09-15 17:30:04	@dom	yeah, what do you think I should run instead there?
2014-09-15 17:30:10	@dom	main soldier again?
2014-09-15 17:31:06	Golem	mmm
2014-09-15 17:31:11	Golem	not sure
2014-09-15 17:31:38	Golem	Tormented hero is pretty good as well
2014-09-15 17:31:48	Golem	and there is that zombie minutar one drop as well
2014-09-15 17:31:55	@dom	I got the zombie mino
2014-09-15 17:32:01	@dom	gnarled scarhide
2014-09-15 17:32:06	@dom	might try tormented hero too
2014-09-15 17:32:45	Golem	You might also just run Hero's Downfall for a no-nonsense kill spell
2014-09-15 17:32:51	Golem	or ride down for a kill spell + damage
2014-09-15 17:33:28	@dom	im gonna try to ride down
2014-09-15 17:33:33	@dom	I think its better than tormented hero
2014-09-15 17:33:36	@dom	maybe
2014-09-15 17:33:45	Golem	This is the time to experiment
2014-09-15 17:33:46	Golem	have a go
2014-09-15 17:34:11	@dom	still need to wait to have someone to play against :P
2014-09-15 17:38:13	@relsqui	okay, that's as long as I can stare at this logo thing today
2014-09-15 17:38:36	@relsqui	there's more stuff I want to do but this interface is so awful
2014-09-15 17:38:39	Golem	lol
2014-09-15 17:38:41	Golem	welp
2014-09-15 17:38:46	Golem	when its done its done
2014-09-15 17:38:51	@dom	^
2014-09-15 17:44:11	Golem	Im home now, if you wanted to do some more testing
2014-09-15 17:44:34	aliaras	ok so I might get t odo icelandic prerelease
2014-09-15 17:44:51	Golem	icelandic?
2014-09-15 17:44:54	Golem	you live in iceland?
2014-09-15 17:44:54	aliaras	because CCP Rise plays and his old teammates play for actual serious
2014-09-15 17:44:57	aliaras	I'm in iceland atm
2014-09-15 17:45:01	aliaras	for khans prerelease

2014-09-15 17:46:02	aliaras	and then was just chatting about what's up lately, said I'd gotten into magic; he plays and his old team was like super serious / good about it
2014-09-15 17:46:06	aliaras	so they know where to go
2014-09-15 17:46:32	Golem	good on them
2014-09-15 17:46:39	Golem	go hard/or go home
2014-09-15 17:46:59	aliaras	yeah I dunno if I can drag anyone else with me
2014-09-15 17:47:13	@relsqui	aliaras: yeah it occurred to me after we talked about it that you were regretting being out of town for prerelease like there isn't magic literally everywhere
2014-09-15 17:47:18	aliaras	I think I'd try him but his wife wants to actually hang out with him. And I might also have commitments to hang out
2014-09-15 17:47:21	aliaras	relsqui: haha yeah
2014-09-15 17:47:27	aliaras	I mean I can't go with local friends which is a little :(
2014-09-15 17:47:32	aliaras	but nonlocal friends maybe!

2014-09-15 17:49:35	aliaras	it's infinite and ~free
2014-09-15 17:49:45	aliaras	this is the best feature of the country afaict
2014-09-15 17:50:02	aliaras	(*may be because it's literally stuffed full of volcanic activity but this is a minor detail)

2014-09-16 12:01:07	@relsqui	oh, interesting.
2014-09-16 12:01:15	@relsqui	delve doesn't reduce cost, it creates an alternative way to pay that cost
2014-09-16 12:01:25	@relsqui	am I misremembering, or is convoke the other way aroudn?
2014-09-16 12:45:25	aliaras	about $42
2014-09-16 12:45:45	@relsqui	ouch.
2014-09-16 12:47:41	aliaras	yeah. not surprising-- see what i said aboit prices here-- but yeah
2014-09-16 12:47:44	Golem	Convoke works the same way.  Each creature you tap pays for 1 colorless or 1 of that creatures color
2014-09-16 12:47:50	@relsqui	ah okay
2014-09-16 12:48:06	Golem	thats what my memories say anyways

2014-09-16 15:08:25	@relsqui	yeah >_<
2014-09-16 15:08:30	@relsqui	it's actually totally my fault though, sorry

2014-09-16 15:08:59	@relsqui	what the actual hell though, I could've SWORN
2014-09-16 15:09:21	@relsqui	that's really frustrating
2014-09-16 15:09:30	@mancat	yeah
2014-09-16 15:10:55	@relsqui	all right, so
2014-09-16 15:11:22	@relsqui	I can email back now and ask them to start a thing now, but chance of getting something done + imprinted by pitp is basically nil
2014-09-16 15:11:30	@relsqui	otoh it results in better work
2014-09-16 15:11:52	@mancat	*shrug* i don't see why not

2014-09-16 15:54:02	@relsqui	time for fucking around is now!
2014-09-16 15:55:49	@dom	relsqui: you got junk commons @ fab?
2014-09-16 15:56:00	@dom	gonna proxy out zombie deck I think

2014-09-16 15:56:43	@dom	k
2014-09-16 15:56:52	@dom	also trying to brew up a combo deck I think
2014-09-16 15:56:58	@dom	working on inspired, without attacking
2014-09-16 15:58:29	@relsqui	nice
2014-09-16 15:58:40	@relsqui	I still wanna try out a real control deck and I realized I have no fucking clue how to build one
2014-09-16 15:58:50	@relsqui	this might actually be a legit reason to netdeck
2014-09-16 15:58:52	@relsqui	try a couple things
2014-09-16 15:58:59	@relsqui	learn how to *play* it first
2014-09-16 15:59:32	@dom	I doubt it
2014-09-16 15:59:37	@dom	I think you're overthinking it
2014-09-16 15:59:57	@dom	just play lots of permission and removal, and 1 wincon
2014-09-16 15:59:59	@dom	thats control
2014-09-16 16:01:36	@dom	(how you do those things is up to you)
2014-09-16 16:01:47	@dom	but thats the basic concepts of control imo
2014-09-16 16:02:29	@dom	for example, in my artifact fateseal deck, I don't run any reactive permission like counterspell, all I have is proactive permission with pyxis, ghoulcallers and codex shredder
2014-09-16 16:02:45	@dom	thats where different control is born
2014-09-16 17:27:06	@dom	relsqui: can you bring the scissors to mtgclub
2014-09-16 17:27:43	@relsqui	don't wanna steal tutor scissors over there, will check if I have my own scissors
2014-09-16 17:28:44	@dom	I thought you had those teeny green ones
2014-09-16 17:29:03	@relsqui	yeah, I'm just not sure if I have them on me
2014-09-16 17:29:32	@relsqui	they've gone back and forth between backpack and magic stuff
2014-09-16 17:29:38	@relsqui	do you also want me to bring dig box for proxying?
2014-09-16 17:32:52	@dom	yes pls
2014-09-16 17:37:45	@dom	mancat: im thinking blue black for inspired combo so I can use macar

2014-09-16 17:37:55	oracle	Creature — Human Rogue 1/3, UB (2)
2014-09-16 17:37:55	oracle	Inspired — Whenever Disciple of Deceit becomes untapped, you may discard a nonland card. If you do, search your library for a card with the same converted mana cost as that card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2014-09-16 17:37:57	@dom	thoughts?
2014-09-16 17:39:53	@dom	damn this is quickly becoming bu merfolk
2014-09-16 17:39:54	@dom	fuck
2014-09-16 17:40:59	@mancat	lol yeah untap mechanics in U[^W] usually ends up being merfolk
2014-09-16 17:41:59	@dom	well what I wanted to do what inspired esque combo deck, and I can do that in blue
2014-09-16 17:42:05	@dom	or the engine part at least
2014-09-16 17:42:17	@dom	but then the rest of the deck is merfolk to fit the theme
2014-09-16 17:42:21	@dom	so idk
2014-09-16 17:42:47	@dom	maybe i'll work on the engine some more and put more combo in it from other places
2014-09-16 17:45:11	@dom	im thinking using arbiter of the ideal and some tap untap engine to stick my deck onto the field
2014-09-16 17:48:36	@dom	oh man this deck is running niblis of the breath in a heartbeat
2014-09-16 17:48:52	@dom	cyall @ mtg

2014-09-18 00:15:42	oracle	{T}: Take an extra turn after this one.
2014-09-18 00:15:54	@dom	banned in everything basically

2014-09-19 09:02:02	aliaras	I can draft 3-color cards
2014-09-19 09:02:05	aliaras	and they're generally good
2014-09-19 09:02:09	aliaras	and I should not be in MORE than three colors
2014-09-19 09:02:18	aliaras	but is there a point at hwich I have too many three-color cards? Where is it?
2014-09-19 12:14:11	@dom	aliaras: I think really theres only a few tricolor cards worth picking up
2014-09-19 12:14:21	@dom	and the rest should really just be support

2014-09-20 11:02:32	aliaras	I guess most of what I have to learn about Khans is going to be if I want to play 3 colors, and how, and how to go even to like 5-colors or whatever

2014-09-21 15:04:33	@relsqui	just dunno where it comes from or anything
2014-09-21 15:04:43	@relsqui	or how I was supposed to know about it if I didn't occasionally hear you guys mention it

2014-09-21 15:10:08	Golem	and the os shouldent matter, at least as long as its a version of cockatrice that works on whatever you are running
2014-09-21 15:10:33	@dom	you'd think
2014-09-21 15:10:34	Golem	if you are running a linux varient, Cockatrice wont work for you anyways most of the time.....sooooooo
2014-09-21 15:10:38	@relsqui	erm
2014-09-21 15:10:41	@relsqui	always has?
2014-09-21 15:10:55	Golem	well thats interesting
2014-09-21 15:10:56	@relsqui	oracle appears to do nothing for me
2014-09-21 15:10:59	@relsqui	but cockatrice works fine
2014-09-21 15:10:59	@dom	relsqui: we run a hacked up version from before summer magic
2014-09-21 15:11:07	@relsqui	I've never used it NOT on linux
2014-09-21 15:11:08	@relsqui	wth is summer magic
2014-09-21 15:11:10	@dom	before the summer magic update, we could get cockatrice source files
2014-09-21 15:11:16	@dom	summer magic was a big cockatrice update
2014-09-21 15:11:38	@dom	because we do, we get janky workarounds and jackshit for support
2014-09-21 15:11:44	@dom	but we can still use cockatrice :)
2014-09-21 15:12:28	@dom	as an aside, I have the most up to date cockatrice on my desktop here (windows) and no problems whatsoever
2014-09-21 15:12:49	@dom	summer magic was a damn good update bugs-wise and working-wise for windows and mac
2014-09-21 15:13:02	@relsqui	this is actually completely idiotic, right? not just me?
2014-09-21 15:13:13	@dom	relsqui: I was complaining about this for a long time
2014-09-21 15:13:19	@dom	for the past like week and a half
2014-09-21 15:13:23	@dom	were you not listening >>
2014-09-21 15:13:33	@dom	(kek)
2014-09-21 15:13:36	@relsqui	dom: HOW DOES IT FEEL :P

2014-09-21 15:14:47	@dom	what? you dont roll dice
2014-09-21 15:14:49	@dom	kek is like storm
2014-09-21 15:14:52	@dom	only better
2014-09-21 15:14:55	@dom	cuz its only 3 letters
2014-09-21 15:15:26	Golem	infoobot: kek totally uses a dice
2014-09-21 15:15:30	Golem	blast
2014-09-21 15:15:52	@dom	the level of kek is not determined by a dice roll
2014-09-21 15:15:59	@dom	>>|
2014-09-21 15:16:02	@dom	kek is not RNG
2014-09-21 15:16:03	@relsqui	it doesn't determine level
2014-09-21 15:16:05	@relsqui	just type
2014-09-21 15:16:11	@relsqui	I was making planechase jokes
2014-09-21 15:16:14	@dom	no kek is always obvious
2014-09-21 15:16:20	@dom	kek does not change type
2014-09-21 15:16:24	@dom	kek is inherent
2014-09-21 15:16:28	@dom	kek is life
2014-09-21 15:16:29	Golem	this may be the best argument I have ever seen
2014-09-21 15:16:37	@dom	im not arguing, im winning
2014-09-21 15:16:40	@dom	im stating a fact

2014-09-21 15:18:54	@dom	if you didn't figure out self-aggrandizing is inherently part of kek...
2014-09-21 15:19:01	@dom	how can you even *kek*?
2014-09-21 15:19:25	Golem	kek is not the path, it shows you how to reach the path.  And then its the path too, because kek
2014-09-21 15:19:51	@dom	kek is both the path and the destination
2014-09-21 15:20:05	@relsqui	bro do u even kek
2014-09-21 15:20:05	@dom	for only on the path to kek can you realize that kek is all around and inside you
2014-09-21 15:21:44	Golem	Oh god, how did I forget that steam augery existed ><
2014-09-21 15:21:51	Golem	need to put that in my control deck

2014-09-23 10:35:06	Golem	dom:  You might want to check out the Rabble Mardu deck in that article, I think its right along the lines of what you were thinking of
2014-09-23 10:47:57	aliaras	that looks like a fun deck that I want to play

2014-09-24 10:11:04	@relsqui	lmao that was in the wrong channel and looks like it was related to the previous topic but was not
2014-09-24 10:21:42	aliaras	haha
2014-09-24 10:21:51	aliaras	I figured it was just in response to a ????? ticket
2014-09-24 10:22:51	@relsqui	kind of, it was someone in #xkcd last night :P
2014-09-24 10:23:05	@relsqui	if someone came to the cat wanting a remotely hosted dedicated server for free, I'd tell them to join the cat >_>
2014-09-24 10:23:09	@relsqui	probably not actually, not a good personality fit
2014-09-24 10:23:49	@relsqui	although I dunno, school of business admin people apparently made good cats?
2014-09-24 10:24:32	aliaras	huh, ok
2014-09-24 10:25:36	@relsqui	have made a lot of cats, over the years, at least
2014-09-24 10:26:00	@relsqui	dammit, my loans came in and I wanna do budgeting stuff now but I need to jump in the shower and then gtfo
2014-09-24 10:26:42	@relsqui	also I'm back in real portland again, it's raining
2014-09-24 10:26:45	aliaras	:(
2014-09-24 10:26:55	@relsqui	10:26:47 < rainycat> relsqui: The 12-hour forecast for PSU is chance of rain until noon, then overcast. High is 67 degrees  at 2:00 PM. Low is 63 degrees at 11:00 AM.
2014-09-24 10:27:12	@relsqui	^ this is not as full-portland as yesterday's forecast, which was basically "rain until blah and then chance of rain"
2014-09-24 10:27:14	aliaras	oh man I found a place last night (well, nucleosynth found a place) that is both a good bar and does magic drafts on tuesdays
2014-09-24 10:27:23	@relsqui	hahaha sweet
2014-09-24 10:27:24	aliaras	relsqui: that is indeed portland
2014-09-24 10:27:33	aliaras	yeah it was pretty excellent, although our pod didn't fire until late
2014-09-24 10:27:49	nucleosynth	http://www.goodlifebar.com/nightlife/game-night-2014-09-30/
2014-09-24 10:27:51	nucleosynth	yeah
2014-09-24 10:28:11	aliaras	we both won one match (I won one from 5 on the draw! <3 Inferno Fiend or w/e his name is)
2014-09-24 10:28:15	aliaras	and then lost and went home
2014-09-24 10:28:17	@relsqui	oh man I wanna draft conspiracy while drinking
2014-09-24 10:28:17	aliaras	but, good night.
2014-09-24 10:28:20	aliaras	hahahaha
2014-09-24 10:28:21	@relsqui	that sounds like the best idea
2014-09-24 10:28:24	aliaras	apparently this will be a thing
2014-09-24 10:28:39	aliaras	I've never looked too hard at conspiracy
2014-09-24 10:28:45	@relsqui	for a number of reasons, but the one that made me think of it was the magic drinking game we keep talking about and haven't actually done yet
2014-09-24 10:28:51	aliaras	oh?
2014-09-24 10:28:54	@relsqui	it has two rules
2014-09-24 10:28:59	@relsqui	1. if you have to ask whose turn it is, drink
2014-09-24 10:29:05	@relsqui	2. if someone asks whose turn it is and it's yours, drink
2014-09-24 10:29:18	aliaras	lol
2014-09-24 10:29:22	@relsqui	corollary: if you have to ask whose turn it is, and it's yours, drink twice.
2014-09-24 10:29:24	aliaras	is this harder to tell when you're playing conspiracy?
2014-09-24 10:29:37	@relsqui	no, it's just the only format you normally draft and then play multi in
2014-09-24 10:29:42	aliaras	ahhhhh okay
2014-09-24 10:29:52	@relsqui	so, well, yes, but because it's designed for multiplayer
2014-09-24 10:30:08	aliaras	got it :D
2014-09-24 10:31:05	@relsqui	yes
2014-09-24 10:31:12	@relsqui	have you seen why conspiracy draft is weird?
2014-09-24 10:31:21	aliaras	I know that it has cards that interact *with the draft*
2014-09-24 10:32:06	@relsqui	yes.
2014-09-24 10:32:20	@relsqui	notable examples include, like
2014-09-24 10:32:24	@relsqui	!card cogwork librarian
2014-09-24 10:32:24	oracle	Artifact Creature — Construct 3/3, 4 (4)
2014-09-24 10:32:24	oracle	Draft Cogwork Librarian face up.
2014-09-24 10:32:24	oracle	As you draft a card, you may draft an additional card from that booster pack. If you do, put Cogwork Librarian into that booster pack.
2014-09-24 10:32:30	@relsqui	er
2014-09-24 10:32:33	@relsqui	that too but not the one I meant
2014-09-24 10:32:40	@relsqui	!card lore seeker
2014-09-24 10:32:40	oracle	Artifact Creature — Construct 2/2, 2 (2)
2014-09-24 10:32:40	oracle	Reveal Lore Seeker as you draft it. After you draft Lore Seeker, you may add a booster pack to the draft. (Your next pick is from that booster pack. Pass it to the next player and it's drafted this draft round.)
2014-09-24 10:33:31	@relsqui	I was standing at the counter at Guardian Games a few months ago and a guy came up and was like
2014-09-24 10:33:35	@relsqui	"can I have one modern masters pack please"
2014-09-24 10:33:37	@relsqui	"... lore seeker?"
2014-09-24 10:33:38	@relsqui	"yep"
2014-09-24 10:33:39	@relsqui	"nice"
2014-09-24 10:34:40	@relsqui	anyway it's weird and fun and we're planning to get a box of it for the club
2014-09-24 10:34:49	@relsqui	not necessarily to draft straight but maybe mix with other things
2014-09-24 10:34:53	@relsqui	KTK/KTK/CON :D
2014-09-24 10:35:52	aliaras	:D
2014-09-24 10:36:02	aliaras	man I really really really really really want Forge to get KTK in
2014-09-24 10:36:19	aliaras	because forge AIs are terrible at drafting but what I want is the Forge ability to just test "is this deck completely nuts"
2014-09-24 10:36:39	aliaras	And I have no faith in my ability to know wtf I'm doing with three colors
2014-09-24 10:36:43	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-24 10:37:05	aliaras	also the way morphs interact with mana curv
2014-09-24 10:37:06	aliaras	e
2014-09-24 10:37:27	aliaras	which is nice-- you can draft some extra baller 6-drops and if you play it face-down, you play it face-down
2014-09-24 10:37:27	@relsqui	right?
2014-09-24 10:37:30	@relsqui	I had trouble with that
2014-09-24 10:37:44	aliaras	I can see it but I don't know how it'll work in practice
2014-09-24 10:37:45	@relsqui	I built a kind of shitty sultai turtling thing on sunday, did poorly
2014-09-24 10:37:54	aliaras	oof
2014-09-24 10:37:57	aliaras	how so?
2014-09-24 10:37:57	 *	relsqui shrugs
2014-09-24 10:37:59	@relsqui	about what I expect
2014-09-24 10:38:00	@relsqui	ed
2014-09-24 10:38:09	@relsqui	anyway I showed mancat my pool later and was like "okay, so what would *you* build"
2014-09-24 10:38:14	@relsqui	and he basically just put me in abzan *g*
2014-09-24 10:38:19	aliaras	haha
2014-09-24 10:38:33	aliaras	how was the sultai thing supposed to work?
2014-09-24 10:39:07	@relsqui	hide behind stuff like !card rotting mastodon
2014-09-24 10:39:07	oracle	Creature — Zombie Elephant 2/8, 4B (5)
2014-09-24 10:39:18	@relsqui	and pick off the opponent with small flyers and stuff like !card archer's parapet
2014-09-24 10:39:19	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-09-24 10:39:24	 *	relsqui gives oracle the finger
2014-09-24 10:39:32	@relsqui	(it has {T}: ping opponent for 1)
2014-09-24 10:39:37	aliaras	right
2014-09-24 10:39:48	aliaras	okay, I have definitely tried drafting that Sultai deck
2014-09-24 10:39:57	@relsqui	but I was up against an abzan deck and their sliverlike behavior
2014-09-24 10:40:03	aliaras	nodnod
2014-09-24 10:40:11	aliaras	and you couldn't just headshot the Outlast lords?
2014-09-24 10:40:21	@relsqui	I had shit for removal
2014-09-24 10:40:33	@relsqui	in sultai colors
2014-09-24 10:40:50	@relsqui	hence mancat switching it to abzan, that helped with that
2014-09-24 10:41:00	@relsqui	anyway so half the opponent's field ended up with lifelink and reach
2014-09-24 10:41:05	@relsqui	so no flyers and no attrition
2014-09-24 10:41:11	@relsqui	we literally timed out game one, I'm not even joking
2014-09-24 10:41:31	@relsqui	like, I had fun, my opponent there was really nice
2014-09-24 10:41:34	aliaras	oh wow
2014-09-24 10:41:35	@relsqui	but it was a silly game
2014-09-24 10:42:00	@relsqui	I'm looking forward to playing sultai in *constructed* :)
2014-09-24 10:42:09	aliaras	yeah that'll be fun :)
2014-09-24 10:42:16	@relsqui	but in limited abzan is a whole township of houses
2014-09-24 10:42:46	aliaras	mmmm
2014-09-24 10:43:09	@relsqui	I think part of my problem with limited is I'm so unused to playing magic as a creature game, lol
2014-09-24 10:43:12	aliaras	yeah I can see that. I also stubbornly want to make something to kick said houses over, but
2014-09-24 10:43:15	aliaras	haha
2014-09-24 10:43:17	aliaras	that makes sense
2014-09-24 10:43:26	aliaras	I think that's part of why I *like* limited
2014-09-24 10:43:32	@relsqui	that also makes sense :P
2014-09-24 10:43:34	 *	relsqui cuddles burn deck
2014-09-24 10:43:57	@relsqui	dom built this zombie thing which is a) pretty stronk and b) goofy
2014-09-24 10:44:01	@relsqui	and it usually beats the burn deck
2014-09-24 10:44:08	@relsqui	which means I get to play the burn deck against something! :D
2014-09-24 10:44:11	@relsqui	this makes me happy and him bored, lol
2014-09-24 10:44:24	@relsqui	the burn deck only runs creatures insofar as it includes !card simian spirit guide
2014-09-24 10:44:24	oracle	Creature — Ape Spirit 2/2, 2R (3)
2014-09-24 10:44:24	oracle	Exile Simian Spirit Guide from your hand: Add {R} to your mana pool.
2014-09-24 10:45:12	@relsqui	and even that's mostly there so my turn 1 play can be !card ankh of mishra
2014-09-24 10:45:12	oracle	Artifact, 2 (2)
2014-09-24 10:45:12	oracle	Whenever a land enters the battlefield, Ankh of Mishra deals 2 damage to that land's controller.
2014-09-24 10:45:18	aliaras	nucleosynth quoted me at some point "Based on my first four hours of play, the three basic card types are: http://lukemckinneydotnet1.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cards2.jpg "
2014-09-24 10:45:21	aliaras	from a post
2014-09-24 10:45:29	aliaras	relsqui: that card is so friggin' annoying

2014-09-24 10:45:35	@relsqui	haha
2014-09-24 10:45:38	@relsqui	I know I love it
2014-09-24 10:45:40	@relsqui	it's so good
2014-09-24 10:45:48	@relsqui	see also !card browbeat
2014-09-24 10:45:49	oracle	Sorcery, 2R (3)
2014-09-24 10:45:49	oracle	Any player may have Browbeat deal 5 damage to him or her. If no one does, target player draws three cards.
2014-09-24 10:45:49	aliaras	I'll build a deck just to hate on it and play you sometime >_>
2014-09-24 10:45:57	@relsqui	lol not hard
2014-09-24 10:46:22	@relsqui	anyway yeah my happy place is with that third card type :P
2014-09-24 10:46:55	aliaras	yeah I like creatures. And Golgari decks. And a lot of red/green decks.
2014-09-24 10:47:03	@relsqui	<3 golgari
2014-09-24 10:47:06	aliaras	which I drafted last night and did not hellawin with, despite Chandra :(

2014-09-24 10:48:09	 *	relsqui no particular affinity for boros actually, just the colors

2014-09-26 10:32:58	nucleosynth	so, in retrospect, maybe when you pick up your starting hand and think "well, I have three lands, but everything else is a 4-drop or higher, surely i'll draw something i can play in the meantime" ... maybe you should just mulligan
2014-09-26 10:33:55	nucleosynth	because empirically, otherwise you die in like five turns to an Inferno Fist'd Black Cat with Haunted Plate Mail and then a Lava Axe on like turn five, and it's hilarious
2014-09-26 13:17:04	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-09-26 13:17:07	@relsqui	good lesson.
2014-09-26 13:17:27	@relsqui	pretty much any time you look at a starting hand and think "surely I'll draw ..."
2014-09-26 13:17:28	@relsqui	mulligan that shit
2014-09-26 13:17:29	@relsqui	<_<
2014-09-26 13:33:40	aliaras	so I've done that and then had to keep much worse hands :(
2014-09-26 13:35:51	nucleosynth	one of the other dudes in the office likes to say that mulliganning or not is the hardest part of the game
2014-09-26 13:35:57	nucleosynth	i am inclined to agree
2014-09-26 13:41:38	aliaras	relsqui: what's your feeling about 1-landers in hella aggro decks?
2014-09-26 13:41:58	aliaras	monocolor, even
2014-09-26 13:42:17	aliaras	my mono red deck the other night had mountain, 1-drop, buncha 2-drops and maybe a 3 or 4

2014-09-26 13:52:15	@relsqui	but if you're asking if one-drops are legit
2014-09-26 13:52:17	@relsqui	yes, one-drops are legit
2014-09-26 13:52:28	aliaras	yeah it's more 'keep or mull 1-lander'
2014-09-26 13:52:51	aliaras	i did win, i forget if in draft or constructed, when i went down to 5 on the play though
2014-09-26 14:01:44	@dom	aliaras: I wouldn't keep a 1-lander in most aggro decks
2014-09-26 14:01:51	@dom	something that curves out at 3, I might
2014-09-26 14:01:58	aliaras	nodnod
2014-09-26 14:02:10	@dom	for example, I sometimes keep 1-lander hands in my zombie deck, which really only cares about 2 lands
2014-09-26 14:03:46	aliaras	ok, cool. i ended up pitching.
2014-09-26 14:04:15	@dom	yeah, if you play anything at all above 3 cmc you shouldn't keep a 1-land hand
2014-09-26 14:04:17	@dom	imo
2014-09-26 14:09:04	aliaras	nodnod
2014-09-26 14:09:12	aliaras	man i really can't wait for khans in forge
2014-09-26 14:09:25	aliaras	so i can start basically doing draft goldfishing and sort out mana issues
2014-09-26 14:10:12	@dom	I mean, theres draft simulators out there
2014-09-26 14:11:01	aliaras	yeah, and i've been using 'em
2014-09-26 14:11:08	aliaras	more concerned with the play aspect though
2014-09-26 14:11:24	aliaras	i dunno how the decks i'm drafting actually do

2014-09-28 14:20:01	@relsqui	idle thought -- what if we decided every other week at the club is draft week?
2014-09-28 14:20:02	@relsqui	or something
2014-09-28 14:20:20	@relsqui	so people who wanna draft know to show up early
2014-09-28 14:20:27	@relsqui	we can start setting it up before having to decide
2014-09-28 14:20:45	@relsqui	aaand it doesn't totally take over from constructed
2014-09-28 14:21:25	 *	relsqui makes a note of that
2014-09-28 14:22:02	@relsqui	on a somewhat related note, it would be nice to have a few minutes near the start of the meeting where we can hit actual club business if there is any
2014-09-28 14:22:13	@relsqui	I hate feeling like I'm shouting over everybody's games
2014-09-28 14:22:16	@relsqui	but sometimes we actually need to decide shit
2014-09-28 14:22:40	@relsqui	might be easier if I don't worry about waiting for latecomers
2014-09-28 14:22:50	@relsqui	and just say "hang on before you start, I'm gonna talk at you guys for a few" and do it at six
2014-09-28 14:22:59	@relsqui	(but then leave info on the whiteboard for latecomers)
2014-09-28 14:25:10	Golem	Yup
2014-09-28 14:25:34	Golem	Stop being tentative, and just say "ok, most people are here, a few announcements before we really get going"

2014-09-28 14:32:09	aliaras	haha
2014-09-28 14:32:29	@relsqui	are they actually *not selling* khans or conspiracy boxes?
2014-09-28 14:32:36	@relsqui	like, if they're not in stock fine
2014-09-28 14:32:39	aliaras	O.o
2014-09-28 14:32:40	@relsqui	but they don't appear to be in inventory
2014-09-28 14:32:47	@relsqui	.... oh, khans probably just isn't up yet, lol
2014-09-28 14:32:57	@relsqui	since that's been legal to sell for like 2 days
2014-09-28 14:33:02	@relsqui	fuck it, I'll just call them

2014-09-28 14:48:45	@relsqui	have a weekend
2014-09-28 14:49:05	@relsqui	(I say this despite having had a date last night, because I was the Most Boring Date)
2014-09-28 14:49:14	@relsqui	on account of being exhausted
2014-09-28 14:58:53	Golem	Well they cant all be winners
2014-09-28 14:59:14	@relsqui	yeah. I mean, it was still pretty great
2014-09-28 14:59:22	@relsqui	ubiquill made some really awesome soup
2014-09-28 14:59:31	@relsqui	that neither of us had had before
2014-09-28 14:59:44	@relsqui	it was, like, all the fall veggies, put into a pot and then later into a blender
2014-09-28 15:01:15	Golem	That sounds vile to me.  Then again, I am a noted and avid carnivore
2014-09-28 15:02:09	@relsqui	suit yourself buddy 8)
2014-09-28 15:02:12	@relsqui	also good bread
2014-09-28 15:02:16	@relsqui	well, decent bread. good toast.
2014-09-28 15:02:19	@relsqui	not sure how that works but it does
2014-09-28 15:02:19	Golem	heh
2014-09-28 18:44:25	@relsqui	"Magic, huh? I used to play when I was much younger but I just gave all my cards away to an orphanage last year (not even joking)." lol
2014-09-28 18:45:25	aliaras	haha
2014-09-28 18:46:24	aliaras	I wanna draft more khans >_>
2014-09-28 18:50:25	 *	relsqui just submitted a budget request for items including a box of Khans
2014-09-28 18:50:35	aliaras	nice :D
2014-09-28 18:51:31	@relsqui	also one of conspiracy and one of innistrad
2014-09-28 18:51:52	aliaras	I'd like to try conspiracy sometime
2014-09-28 18:52:01	aliaras	innistrad block seems cool but I dunno anything about it
2014-09-28 18:52:12	@relsqui	I like a lot of the cards in it and I hear it was a good limited format
2014-09-28 18:52:17	@relsqui	although I'm feeling pretty useless at limited these days
2014-09-28 18:52:23	aliaras	I sorta like the theme
2014-09-28 18:52:27	aliaras	aww, howcome?
2014-09-28 18:52:39	@relsqui	I mean, it's not that I've gotten worse at it, I just never got good at it
2014-09-28 18:52:43	@relsqui	and that's only fun for so long
2014-09-28 18:52:49	@relsqui	and I'm not getting any practice
2014-09-28 18:52:54	@relsqui	(because time, money)
2014-09-28 18:53:12	aliaras	nodnod
2014-09-28 18:53:44	aliaras	I know nucleosynth figured out how to make drafting on cockatrice work
2014-09-28 18:54:00	@relsqui	I don't really have time for not-work right now
2014-09-28 18:54:06	@relsqui	running the club is work so it gets a pass
2014-09-28 18:54:08	@relsqui	actually playing magic is not
2014-09-28 18:54:27	@relsqui	which works out because I'm better at the first one
2014-09-28 18:56:16	aliaras	mmm, makes sense
2014-09-28 23:27:55	Golem	Well, its 11;30 and im not asleep despite my best efforts
2014-09-28 23:28:16	Golem	so here are the results of the first 2 major tournaments in the new standard, for those of us who are interested in such things
2014-09-28 23:28:27	Golem	http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck_search_result.asp?Location=Magic-League%20Masters%20Trial%20-%209/18/14

2014-09-28 23:28:39	@dom	yup
2014-09-28 23:28:42	Golem	sorry if the links are ugly
2014-09-28 23:28:53	Golem	The first one is basically exactly as I predicted
2014-09-28 23:29:16	Golem	a form of u/w control, green devotion, temur midrange, mardu tokens
2014-09-28 23:29:34	Golem	I was off a bit on the exact type of control.  Apparently black is still good for removal
2014-09-28 23:29:38	Golem	;p
2014-09-28 23:29:50	Golem	I was not expecting the results of the second tournament
2014-09-28 23:30:05	Golem	whos top 8 consisted of 6 azban decks of 3 differant types
2014-09-28 23:30:10	Golem	a winning black aggro deck
2014-09-28 23:30:15	Golem	and a jeskai midrange/burn deck
2014-09-28 23:30:24	@dom	yeah I saw that
2014-09-28 23:30:40	@dom	need to buckle down and study the results next weekend I think
2014-09-28 23:30:47	Golem	Might be wise
2014-09-28 23:31:30	Golem	Ill try to make it to magic club tomorrow, but I may be late and/or not coming depending on how late my work goes on the first day.  Also have to deal with parking now, humph
2014-09-28 23:34:56	Golem	Anyways, with these decks and a jeskai storm-ish combo deck lurking around it looks to be a fun standard ^_^
2014-09-28 23:37:16	 *	relsqui ears prick up
2014-09-28 23:37:20	@relsqui	jeskai storm-ish deck you say
2014-09-28 23:37:27	Golem	Oh you havent heard?
2014-09-28 23:37:30	@relsqui	:p
2014-09-28 23:37:31	Golem	there are 2 types
2014-09-28 23:37:31	@relsqui	of course not
2014-09-28 23:38:04	Golem	basically one is a true combo deck, that abuses retraction helix, a creature, and a x-spell artifact to cycle the artifact an infanite number of times
2014-09-28 23:38:18	Golem	pluss jeskai ascendancy of course
2014-09-28 23:38:39	Golem	this makes an infanitely large creature, which you then punch them in face with
2014-09-28 23:38:50	Golem	it also lets you loot through your deck if you like
2014-09-28 23:39:15	Golem	I dont like that one, because its easily disrupted and has basicaly no backup plan
2014-09-28 23:39:29	Golem	the more interesting one IMO, is the mana dork deck
2014-09-28 23:39:47	@dom	that does something similar using dorks for ramp
2014-09-28 23:39:52	@dom	and then swings with dorks for the kill
2014-09-28 23:39:57	Golem	basically you put out mana dorks, then cast jeskai ascendancy, then start casting cheap spells that replace themselves
2014-09-28 23:40:05	Golem	like dragon mantle
2014-09-28 23:40:15	Golem	each time you do this, you get free mana
2014-09-28 23:40:20	Golem	which you use to draw more cards
2014-09-28 23:40:24	Golem	which gets you more free mana
2014-09-28 23:40:55	Golem	eventually you have all the enchantments on a dude, and can hit them in the face.  Or give them the ability to tap to deal damge and infanite number of times
2014-09-28 23:41:18	Golem	I think thats the smarter way to go, because in a pinch you can still just make a lot of mana and use a firebreathing elf to kill them
2014-09-28 23:42:09	Golem	Now is either of these ideas "good"?  Im not so convinced.  But they are fun and competative, and I suspect it wont take much to make them a player in standard at some point
2014-09-28 23:42:50	@dom	i think they have too many moving parts
2014-09-28 23:42:58	Golem	Probably
2014-09-28 23:43:14	Golem	But it wouldent take much to make those moving parts good on thier own, and have the combo be a surprise kill
2014-09-28 23:43:27	@dom	yar, especially the dork method
2014-09-29 05:45:26	aliaras	yeah so you just need a good jeskai deck with a backup plan
2014-09-29 05:45:57	aliaras	tbh you could make it work with sylvan caryatid and the backup plan being the usual RG "ramp out big shit"
2014-09-29 11:09:39	 *	nucleosynth catches up on backscroll
2014-09-29 11:10:02	nucleosynth	drafting on cockatrice wasn't so hard, actually, once you get a few pointers

2014-09-29 14:07:29	aliaras	\o/

2014-09-29 14:27:33	Golem	It went well
2014-09-29 14:27:56	Golem	Tech support and fiddling about with projectors and tv-size touchscreens
2014-09-29 14:28:05	Golem	They gave me my own projector!
2014-09-29 14:31:55	@relsqui	:D

2014-09-29 15:29:33	aliaras	brb figuring out how much this hand is gonna 0wn
2014-09-29 15:41:37	aliaras	answer: 10/14 trampler (acolyte) + dropped Polukranos.
2014-09-29 15:42:13	aliaras	turn 7 either turn him monstrous (x = 5) (ehhh) or drop another acolyte and start over.
2014-09-29 15:47:48	aliaras	otoh if you really want to go off: 4 lands, caryatid, mystic, 2x acolyte with ascendancy down and a hand full o' instants
2014-09-29 16:10:13	aliaras	result of that hand: Polukranos monstrosity with x=30; an 8/7 untapped mystic that just got in for 18 damage.
2014-09-29 16:11:00	aliaras	also if you get counterspelled do you still cast a spell #askingforafriend
2014-09-29 16:12:10	@relsqui	yes.
2014-09-29 16:12:20	@relsqui	a spell has been cast once its costs have been paid and it's been put on the stack
2014-09-29 16:12:30	@relsqui	prowess dgaf whether the spell RESOLVED
2014-09-29 16:12:36	aliaras	nice
2014-09-29 16:16:23	aliaras	okay so I think this might be broken and I might just go get a playset in the event that it is
2014-09-29 16:16:31	aliaras	need to still improve consistency

2014-09-29 19:45:08	aliaras	why if you use Act of Treason does it remove an enchantment?
2014-09-29 19:45:50	@relsqui	it ... shouldn't? what happened?
2014-09-29 19:46:37	aliaras	I had Inferno Fist on a Satyr Hoplite
2014-09-29 19:46:45	aliaras	opponent cast Act of Treason targeting said Hoplite
2014-09-29 19:46:49	aliaras	inferno fist in my graveyard
2014-09-29 19:47:08	@relsqui	not obvious to me why that'd be so, lemme ask one of the judges
2014-09-29 19:47:09	@relsqui	this is mtgo?

2014-09-29 19:48:53	aliaras	not like
2014-09-29 19:48:58	aliaras	"well she did when she cast it v0v"
2014-09-29 19:49:00	@relsqui	yeah, it can no longer legally enchant it, so it stops

2014-09-30 19:07:25	aliaras	was looking *great* until turn 5
2014-09-30 19:12:23	aliaras	relsqui: do you have a not horrific (e.g. not artifacts or burn *g*) deck on cockatrice and wanna play?
2014-09-30 19:12:54	@relsqui	no, no, and no; the third no is to the implied "do you have time any free time between now and christmas" :P

2014-10-01 16:45:53	@relsqui	I, um. should figure out how to now spend it
2014-10-01 16:46:06	aliaras	okay so I've been testing this Jeskai Ascendancy deck, and I actually swapped to the channelfireball version, but swapped in 4x Burning Anger
2014-10-01 16:46:12	aliaras	which is a *much* better kill condition.
2014-10-01 16:46:28	@relsqui	nice
2014-10-01 16:47:33	aliaras	it runs a lot of 'find enchantment', burning anger is an enchantment, and you can do some really nice stuff with it.
2014-10-01 16:48:01	@relsqui	or, well, one really nice thing very well
2014-10-01 16:48:05	aliaras	yes
2014-10-01 16:48:11	@relsqui	:P
2014-10-01 16:48:12	aliaras	but as the whole point is "untap guys"... :p
2014-10-01 16:55:19	@relsqui	aliaras: btw from yesterday I'm flattered that you find my burn deck horrific ^_^
2014-10-01 16:55:35	@relsqui	had some fun with it with stormcrow on monday
2014-10-01 16:55:56	@relsqui	it's an unpredictable match with his new phyrexian artifacts, mostly because of !card spellskite

2014-10-01 16:56:25	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.
2014-10-01 16:56:28	@relsqui	oh what's it called
2014-10-01 16:56:31	aliaras	I think actually jeskai could maybe beat burn

2014-10-01 16:59:02	@relsqui	"if you play a land it will kill you, lol"
2014-10-02 03:54:28	@relsqui	huh. the price I got for an innistrad box over the phone was incorrect; TV sells them for a lot more. but I can find them for somewhere in between elsewhere online
2014-10-02 04:00:17	@relsqui	they also don't have them in stock, though
2014-10-02 04:00:29	@relsqui	so I guess I'll get the purchase order for khans and conspiracy
2014-10-02 04:00:41	@relsqui	unless we wanna pick out another one
2014-10-02 04:01:05	@relsqui	ohh, I bet the person on the phone was assuming I meant avacyn restored
2014-10-02 04:01:07	@relsqui	which they *do* have in stock

2014-10-04 15:57:14	@dom	the only nonland permanents he can play are sunburst permanents, and only for sunburst 4+
2014-10-04 15:57:22	@relsqui	rofl
2014-10-04 15:57:44	@dom	the deck must include at least 20 cards with "sunburst" in the rule text
2014-10-04 15:57:54	@dom	to prevent "this is a burn deck, kek"
2014-10-04 15:59:34	@relsqui	alternatively, "nonland cards" :P
2014-10-04 16:02:53	@dom	well he does have that land based deck, right
2014-10-04 16:03:16	@dom	he just pushed a commit, so he'll probably look at irc in the next 30 minutes or so
2014-10-04 16:03:33	@dom	I mean, the way you get around sunburst is to win with manland

2014-10-05 21:59:21	@relsqui	@_@
2014-10-05 21:59:24	 *	relsqui gets a pencil
2014-10-05 22:00:16	@relsqui	hoplite gets 2, leader and hoplite each get 2 -- so now hoplite has 4 and leader has 2 ... then solidarity resolves, hoplite gets 5 more and leader gets 3 more
2014-10-05 22:00:33	@relsqui	so 9/5 I thiiiiink?
2014-10-05 22:01:23	@relsqui	oh, derp, forgot to double the hardened scales' effects
2014-10-05 22:01:34	@relsqui	hoplite gets *three*, leader and hoplite each get three
2014-10-05 22:01:57	@relsqui	so it's 6/3, and then the "doubling" makes it 14/8

2014-10-05 22:15:34	@relsqui	Q: Your opponent controls Surrak Dragonclaw and targets it and your 4/4 Bear token with Savage Punch. In response, you force your opponent to sacrifice Surrak Dragonclaw with Crackling Doom. What happens?
2014-10-05 22:15:39	@relsqui	A: The choices are...
2014-10-05 22:15:41	@relsqui	A: Savage Punch is countered on resolution.
2014-10-05 22:15:44	@relsqui	B: Savage Punch resolves and does nothing.
2014-10-05 22:15:46	@relsqui	C: Surrak Dragonclaw's last known information deals 6 damage to the Bear.
2014-10-05 22:15:49	@relsqui	D: Surrak Dragonclaw's last known information deals 8 damage to the Bear.

2014-10-06 01:13:32	 *	relsqui also -_-;
2014-10-06 02:24:06	@dom	so karn is pretty good, but I dont know if I should really use him as a commander
2014-10-06 02:24:19	@dom	for one, I straight up lose to price of progress esque effects
2014-10-06 02:24:22	@dom	no basics allowed
2014-10-06 02:29:11	@dom	i think sydri might be better
2014-10-06 08:03:18	@mancat	you're probably fine m
2014-10-06 08:03:22	@mancat	with karn
2014-10-06 08:03:28	@mancat	who moved my delete key
2014-10-06 08:04:01	@mancat	better
2014-10-06 08:04:10	 *	mancat likes his sun type 6 keyboards now
2014-10-06 08:05:19	@mancat	arg wtf
2014-10-06 08:51:08	 *	relsqui makes a note -- guardian won't take a purchase order, or at least doesn't know how
2014-10-06 12:36:48	aliaras	yesterday is catching up to me -_-
2014-10-06 13:52:45	@dom	mancat: I didn't end up using sydri
2014-10-06 13:53:01	@dom	as I when I started to build it, it seemed to be the same thing, except with thopter foundry
2014-10-06 13:53:16	@dom	and some hinder and condemn and stuff
2014-10-06 13:55:42	@dom	the deck list is also under $300 which waas my limit for proxying up an edh deck >>
2014-10-07 01:57:32	 *	relsqui makes notes
2014-10-07 01:57:49	@relsqui	going to go by salp about a locker tomorrow
2014-10-07 01:58:26	@relsqui	hopefully come away with, if not the locker itself, dimensions
2014-10-07 01:58:46	@relsqui	which I can use to spec out a rolling case and resubmit a budget
2014-10-07 01:59:01	@relsqui	when that goes through I can fire off the request to spend money I just filled out
2014-10-07 01:59:09	@relsqui	which, hopefully, actually results in us owning product
2014-10-07 01:59:18	@relsqui	(two requests to spend money, more likely; one for cards and one for the case)
2014-10-07 02:03:21	@relsqui	mancat: I haven't forgotten about buying cube, decks, and other stuff; I'm deliberately letting the dust settle on this first, so I can see how the process works and SALP can see we know what we're doing/aren't scamming them :P
2014-10-07 02:03:43	@relsqui	(also gives us more time for graphic design -> stamp -> marking cards -> more conspicuous legitimacy)
2014-10-07 10:39:35	aliaras	Okay. Okay. I think I have *the* Jeskai decklist.
2014-10-07 10:39:41	aliaras	Ascendancy in standard, I mean
2014-10-07 11:13:45	@dom	mancat: metalworker is getting unbanned in commander
2014-10-07 11:13:47	@dom	soon
2014-10-07 14:35:26	@mancat	dom: that's gross
2014-10-07 14:36:00	@dom	i'm adding him
2014-10-07 14:36:03	@dom	he is unbanned atm
2014-10-07 14:36:25	@mancat	that card is broken in half
2014-10-07 14:36:40	@dom	him and staff of dom is infinity in itself
2014-10-07 14:36:48	@dom	if you have 3 artifacts in hand
2014-10-07 14:36:51	@dom	which guess what
2014-10-07 14:36:57	@dom	I probably will
2014-10-07 14:37:15	@dom	infinite mana, infinite cards, infinite tap your shit
2014-10-07 14:38:36	@dom	and infinite life
2014-10-07 14:38:40	@dom	but thats kinda meh
2014-10-07 14:39:23	@mancat	infinite life is pretty good actually
2014-10-07 14:39:49	@dom	its kinda irrelevant at that point
2014-10-07 14:39:54	@mancat	a significant number of decks don't have a way to win through that
2014-10-07 14:40:02	@mancat	i guess so, yeah
2014-10-07 14:40:10	@dom	well, with infinite life and my deck, I can just combo normally
2014-10-07 14:40:20	@mancat	yeah
2014-10-07 14:40:37	@dom	I took out power conduit for metalworker
2014-10-07 14:40:42	@dom	I think its a good trade
2014-10-07 14:41:52	@dom	I forgot I had nim deathmantle in here
2014-10-07 14:42:29	@mancat	you didn't cut power conduit yet?
2014-10-07 14:42:34	@dom	well, I did now
2014-10-07 14:42:35	@mancat	i thought that was long gone
2014-10-07 14:42:38	@dom	no
2014-10-07 16:35:24	aliaras	fuck. thoughtsieze.
2014-10-07 16:35:59	aliaras	lol

2014-10-07 17:05:36	aliaras	7:41 PM CovenantElite: hrm... something tells me i thoughtseized the wrong card
2014-10-07 17:05:43	aliaras	true story bro, true story.
2014-10-07 21:20:50	@dom	mancat: I remember why I have candles of leng now
2014-10-07 21:21:10	@dom	with its text, it reads instead as "4T: Draw a card"
2014-10-07 21:21:15	@dom	!card candles of leng

2014-10-07 21:21:49	@dom	I think what I cut was better, but it isn't as terrible as you thought
2014-10-07 21:21:59	@dom	what I cut it for*
2014-10-07 21:33:15	@dom	spirit of the labyrinth doesn't do shit to tutor effects, yeah?

2014-10-09 19:52:42	hylleddin	heh
2014-10-09 19:54:12	hylleddin	I miss my Polukranos
2014-10-10 05:37:54	aliaras	so I'm reading about cubes and cubing and I'm increasingly convinced I want a noob cube
2014-10-10 05:38:10	aliaras	as in "welcome to magic let's play with this cube for a bit"
2014-10-10 09:57:41	@dom	aliaras: honestly I think ours is pretty close to that
2014-10-10 09:57:47	@dom	theres no ghetto-jank combos in there
2014-10-10 09:58:03	@dom	its all just "is dis solid? why yes, yes it is"
2014-10-10 09:58:49	@relsqui	I dunno, I think one geared specifically towards newbies might prioritize simpler and/or newer cards more
2014-10-10 09:58:56	@relsqui	newer mostly 'cause better templating
2014-10-10 09:59:22	@dom	the cards are pretty simple, at some point they have to be trying to learn the synergies
2014-10-10 09:59:34	@relsqui	I'm thinking of people at the level of "still trying to understand what the card does"
2014-10-10 09:59:35	@dom	I feel like using a really simple cube wouldn't help anybody leaarn
2014-10-10 09:59:41	@relsqui	it depends on what part of learning they're at ;)
2014-10-10 09:59:43	@relsqui	:)*
2014-10-10 09:59:50	@relsqui	I was thinking not learning strategy but learning how the game *works*
2014-10-10 09:59:56	@relsqui	having to read 15 complicated cards every time you get passed a pack sucks
2014-10-10 10:00:02	@dom	if they've literally never played enough
2014-10-10 10:00:10	@dom	to not know how to play
2014-10-10 10:00:17	@dom	drafting is a different matter
2014-10-10 10:00:32	@dom	I can agree with you that that is not a skill that comes intuitively for a lot of people
2014-10-10 10:15:29	aliaras	could do sealed off it too
2014-10-10 10:15:46	aliaras	which was my best intro, sorta seeded sealed
2014-10-10 10:16:35	aliaras	goal would be simple cards typifying a color and synergies therein
2014-10-10 12:07:59	aliaras	unrelatedly I keep expecting first strike to matter with fight cards.
2014-10-10 12:09:05	@relsqui	heh, nope
2014-10-10 12:09:11	@relsqui	no combat step -> no extra combat step
2014-10-10 12:09:12	aliaras	yeah
2014-10-10 12:09:16	aliaras	realized that eventually
2014-10-10 12:09:19	aliaras	but RIP my dudes in the meantime
2014-10-10 12:09:59	@relsqui	heh
2014-10-10 12:10:20	@relsqui	I'm a little surprised you haven't been reading the comp rules! I wouldn't expect or recommend it for most people, but it seems like the kind of thing you personally would do
2014-10-10 12:10:24	@relsqui	for basically the same reasons I did
2014-10-10 12:10:48	@relsqui	I guess I'm still not recommending it per se
2014-10-10 12:10:52	@relsqui	but it does make stuff like that more intuitive
2014-10-10 12:13:36	aliaras	I'm not sure where or how and sometimes my eyes glaze over and so I much prefer being like "....hey relsqui...."
2014-10-10 12:13:46	@relsqui	haha that's fair
2014-10-10 12:13:52	@relsqui	I do enjoy being able to answer questions :)
2014-10-10 12:14:11	@relsqui	also I can never remember where the fuck it is on the actual site either, so I just link directly to the rules/formats page from the club site *g*

2014-10-11 19:56:59	@dom	maybe not plays, but she is familiar with the game at least
2014-10-11 19:59:55	@relsqui	I haven't
2014-10-11 19:59:57	@relsqui	we should invite her to the club
2014-10-11 20:00:03	@relsqui	I assume she has no time
2014-10-11 20:00:09	@relsqui	also it might give mancat trauma
2014-10-11 20:00:12	@relsqui	but it would be hilarious, so
2014-10-12 17:41:58	Golem	I would be traumatized by Karlamagic
2014-10-12 17:42:11	Golem	Pro Tour Khans is giving me the sadhappy
2014-10-12 17:42:22	Golem	happy because I have thus far predicted the meta almost to a T
2014-10-12 17:42:37	Golem	sad because that means my favorite deck is getting hated out of the format, looks like
2014-10-12 17:46:07	hylleddin	Which deck is that?
2014-10-12 17:51:33	Golem	Temur midrange
2014-10-12 18:56:04	aliaras	what's the meta so far?
2014-10-12 19:06:16	Golem	So, top of the pile as of RIGHT NOW
2014-10-12 19:06:44	Golem	Winner of Pro tour Khans in the hands of Ari Lax
2014-10-12 19:06:49	Golem	Azban Midrange
2014-10-12 19:07:14	Golem	The other contender for the crown, Jeskai Tempo
2014-10-12 19:08:08	Golem	Other decks that are tier one, Green Devotion, Jeskai Ascendancy Combo, Dimir Control, And Mardu Midrange
2014-10-12 19:10:17	Golem	Theres also various types of R/G midrange that could still be good, but none have really showed the top 8 quality so far, and there are a lot of aggro decks that seem to be being hated out of the format by all the midrange
2014-10-12 19:11:32	Golem	Of course, all thats going to change after this tournament
2014-10-12 19:18:06	aliaras	curious to see what jeskai ascendancy combo list is being played
2014-10-12 19:18:08	aliaras	compare to mine
2014-10-12 19:18:12	aliaras	what's their win condition?
2014-10-12 19:19:37	aliaras	Q_Q whenever it gets hated outta the format
2014-10-12 19:20:56	aliaras	....nissa, it looks like. Huh!
2014-10-12 19:23:09	Golem	yeah, it also had a transformational sideboard where it just changes into a temur/jeskai beatdown deck that uses ascendancy as extra damamge and card selection
2014-10-12 19:23:29	Golem	Which I think is a cool and smart idea
2014-10-12 19:24:27	aliaras	yeah, that's a good deal
2014-10-12 19:28:52	aliaras	my current list: http://deckstats.net/decks/22729/135389-ascendancy-combo
2014-10-12 19:29:26	aliaras	fewer lands (which I don't know that I like), more cantrips, and I use Akroan Crusader to win with but Nissa's damn brilliant
2014-10-12 19:31:01	aliaras	Hmmm. Wonder what happens if I replace my painlands with scrylands and change nothing else.
2014-10-12 19:34:23	Golem	Kinda a make your own mana guy that also has trample
2014-10-12 19:34:57	aliaras	yeah
2014-10-12 19:35:09	aliaras	trample being a pretty good keyword there
2014-10-12 19:35:37	aliaras	5-mana casting cost is a little ouch but otoh you get a trampling mana guy.
2014-10-12 19:43:34	aliaras	lol
2014-10-12 19:43:39	aliaras	it finally happened
2014-10-12 19:43:41	aliaras	mirror match on mtgo
2014-10-12 19:45:25	aliaras	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand opponent got there and me with no countermagic up
2014-10-12 19:45:48	aliaras	well, maybe.
2014-10-12 19:47:39	aliaras	nope!
2014-10-12 19:54:21	Golem	lol
2014-10-12 19:56:00	aliaras	eventually did
2014-10-12 19:56:05	aliaras	i didn't counter a dig through time, shoulda
2014-10-12 20:00:02	Golem	yup
2014-10-12 20:03:55	aliaras	second game: countered the treasure cruise, opp fizzled, i didn't
2014-10-12 20:05:59	Golem	Ats the way
2014-10-12 20:06:02	Golem	win the tiebreaker
2014-10-12 20:06:43	aliaras	hopefully can
2014-10-12 20:06:45	aliaras	mana issues itt
2014-10-12 20:07:09	aliaras	which is like
2014-10-12 20:07:12	aliaras	this deck.txt
2014-10-12 20:08:09	Golem	yup
2014-10-12 20:12:01	aliaras	i think i'm gonna lose
2014-10-12 20:13:12	aliaras	opp had two
2014-10-12 20:16:35	aliaras	def lost
2014-10-12 20:16:37	aliaras	oh well!
2014-10-12 20:19:59	aliaras	http://www.quickmeme.com/img/34/34bde2c7eac4b12fec8ebfad5b806f0f5c12f2f7493fd40ca2e01f5d6c84901e.jpg
2014-10-12 20:31:37	Golem	heh
2014-10-12 20:31:46	Golem	its hard to be mad when you loose the mirror if you like the deck
2014-10-12 22:15:37	@relsqui	Q: I control a Civilized Scholar who is a copy of Delver of Secrets due to Infinite Reflection. If the Scholar transforms, will it still be a copy of Delver?
2014-10-12 22:15:41	@relsqui	^ this is a weird one.
2014-10-12 22:16:09	@relsqui	leaving myself this for later since I need to get outta here and I'm not done with it yet http://www.cranialinsertion.com/article/1422
2014-10-13 08:58:07	hylleddin	//sdfsdfkj/
2014-10-13 08:58:44	@relsqui	you don't say
2014-10-13 09:01:44	hylleddin	Sorry, terminal wasn't updating, so I was trying random shit.
2014-10-13 09:01:53	@relsqui	*g* no worries
2014-10-13 09:01:59	hylleddin	Restarted it, and it's better now.
2014-10-13 09:03:17	@relsqui	screen++
2014-10-13 16:55:02	sabreman	I swear I'll actualy come to a meating some day soon.
2014-10-13 16:55:16	sabreman	Probably not this weak though, dat homework pile D:
2014-10-13 16:57:07	@relsqui	yeahhh
2014-10-13 21:23:36	hylleddin	So, that polymorph deck I had went against stormcrow's Agent of Bolas deck tonight.
2014-10-13 21:24:16	@relsqui	yah?
2014-10-13 21:24:19	hylleddin	And he ended up phyrexian metamorph my Blightsteels twice.
2014-10-13 21:24:34	hylleddin	That was a crazy game.
2014-10-13 21:24:37	@relsqui	ahaha
2014-10-13 21:25:23	hylleddin	I ended up winning, but it was kind of close.
2014-10-13 21:27:02	@relsqui	nice :)
2014-10-13 21:27:04	@relsqui	sounds like fun
2014-10-13 21:30:33	hylleddin	It was. Took for ever though.
2014-10-13 21:30:38	hylleddin	*forever
2014-10-13 21:31:02	hylleddin	I am too much of a grammer nazi for irc. I star half my comments.
2014-10-13 21:31:16	@dom	use sed instead
2014-10-13 21:31:17	hylleddin	*IRC
2014-10-13 21:31:19	@dom	s/ever/forever/
2014-10-13 21:32:16	@relsqui	I just use s/what I said/what I meant/
2014-10-13 21:32:18	@relsqui	solves this nicely
2014-10-13 21:32:37	stormcrow	For more fun, I had a mimic vat out on the field. If she had attacked and I had blocked, they would have destroyed each other, but my mimic vat would have grabbed the actual blightsteel colossus
2014-10-13 21:33:34	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-13 21:37:09	@relsqui	whoa, that was weird. I just briefly forgot how to write a capital G in cursive
2014-10-13 21:37:22	@relsqui	I've been writing primarily in cursive for almost 20 years
2014-10-13 21:56:02	@relsqui	!card ambiguity
2014-10-13 21:56:03	oracle	Enchantment, 2UU (4)
2014-10-13 21:56:03	oracle	Whenever a player plays a spell that counters a spell that has been played or a player plays a spell that comes into play with counters, that player may counter the next spell played or put an additional counter on a permanent that has already been played, but not countered.
2014-10-13 21:56:55	@dom	its not even ambiguous
2014-10-13 21:57:17	@dom	they ust use the string 'play' and 'counter' a lot
2014-10-13 21:57:23	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-13 21:57:30	@relsqui	it's not at all syntactically ambiguous
2014-10-13 21:57:42	@relsqui	which is why it only has one syntax tree
2014-10-13 21:57:44	@relsqui	I wanna draw it >_>
2014-10-13 21:58:12	@relsqui	I don't know how yet. I have ideas.
2014-10-13 21:58:16	@relsqui	I get parts of it.
2014-10-13 21:58:32	@relsqui	I wonder if I still have my notes from Intro lying around
2014-10-13 22:00:20	 *	relsqui sketches the overall shape without putting in all the technical details
2014-10-13 22:00:28	@relsqui	this is my goal for syntax class.
2014-10-13 22:00:43	@relsqui	if I can diagram the oracle text of Ambiguity by my birthday I will feel like I've gotten my money's worth
2014-10-13 22:01:16	@relsqui	!
2014-10-13 22:01:23	@relsqui	thinking about this legit just helped me with my homework
2014-10-13 22:02:15	@relsqui	I was trying to figure out whether "may counter" is one piece (with "may" as an auxiliary) or whether "may" is the verb with "counter" as an argument
2014-10-13 22:02:25	@relsqui	but disambiguating between those cases is *what we're working on this week*
2014-10-13 22:02:30	@relsqui	it's just a less obvious example than the ones we've been practicing on
2014-10-13 22:02:42	@relsqui	I totally have the tools to answer that
2014-10-13 22:02:54	@relsqui	(it's the second one)
2014-10-13 22:05:28	@relsqui	this is actually relatively straightforward
2014-10-13 22:05:34	@relsqui	the hardest part is fitting it on the damn paper, lol
2014-10-13 22:06:26	@relsqui	oh, "has already been" is tricky
2014-10-13 22:07:54	@relsqui	! there are online tools for this
2014-10-14 13:27:26	hylleddin	relsqui's thesis title: Syntax and Semantics of Magic the Gathering Card and Rules Text
2014-10-14 13:27:47	@relsqui	I'd do it.
2014-10-14 13:28:22	@relsqui	this is as far as I got, it omits a lot of major things but gets the overall shape right https://www.dropbox.com/s/opsd4qlys2usogr/syntax_tree.png
2014-10-14 13:34:39	hylleddin	I would probably read that thesis.
2014-10-14 13:35:03	@relsqui	I don't think I would actually write it about semantics
2014-10-14 13:35:13	@relsqui	although that would be interesting -- the efficacy of templating, perhaps
2014-10-14 13:35:18	@relsqui	I'd rather do a corpus analysis on the templates
2014-10-14 13:35:59	hylleddin	Oh, that does sound fun.
2014-10-14 13:36:04	@relsqui	see?
2014-10-14 13:36:48	hylleddin	Man, now I'm really curious about the various word frequencies.
2014-10-14 13:36:58	@relsqui	ha
2014-10-14 13:37:00	hylleddin	And how they change for different sets or formats.
2014-10-14 13:37:02	@relsqui	I mean, this is doable!
2014-10-14 13:37:04	@relsqui	the corpus is available
2014-10-14 13:37:25	@relsqui	frankly it's one of the more readily available corpora >_>
2014-10-14 13:37:46	@relsqui	although I'm not sure if that gets you original text as well as errata text
2014-10-14 13:38:07	hylleddin	Yeah, I remember trying to get word frequency lists for Korean and German
2014-10-14 13:38:29	@relsqui	yeah for a language overall ... well, you can't *do* it for a language overall, you have to choose a body or kind of work
2014-10-14 13:38:33	@relsqui	and even then collecting it is a PITA
2014-10-14 13:38:38	@relsqui	but cards you can just fetch
2014-10-14 13:38:38	@relsqui	brb
2014-10-14 13:39:23	hylleddin	I think tcg or starcity has card text instead of oracle text.
2014-10-14 13:47:40	hylleddin	Yeah, tcg does.
2014-10-14 13:47:50	hylleddin	So you could scrape them from that.
2014-10-14 13:48:24	hylleddin	And compare the oracle text corpus to the card text corpus!
2014-10-14 16:38:05	@relsqui	probably don't even need to do that. I'm not sure mtgjson.com doesn't have both
2014-10-14 17:57:14	hylleddin	Huh, I was unaware of mtgjson. It looks like it does have both.
2014-10-14 17:59:04	@relsqui	cool
2014-10-14 17:59:07	@relsqui	and yeah, it is the best thing
2014-10-15 00:40:16	hylleddin	relsqui: Speaking of nerdy/geeky linguistics, this seems right up your alley: https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/
2014-10-15 08:11:59	@relsqui	huh, interesting
2014-10-15 08:12:11	@relsqui	the approach is an improvement on most arguments about it, to be sure
2014-10-15 08:12:36	@relsqui	I'd be interested in the influence of the specific data sources, though; which one do people self-identify as vs. accuse others of being
2014-10-16 00:44:35	@dom	aliaras: hey, you're the only one I know who has used mtgo
2014-10-16 00:44:50	@dom	did you have to spend a ton to start breaking even with draft winnings?
2014-10-16 00:46:18	@dom	(did you ever break even with draft winnings? >>)
2014-10-16 00:49:41	 *	dom brews decks I can build with <$20 in paper, hopes its comparable to MTGO
2014-10-16 02:07:03	 *	dom spends the tickets he got at the beginning making a cheap goblins deck
2014-10-16 02:20:44	 *	dom kicks ass but no one will play with him in the getting serious room
2014-10-16 02:20:58	@dom	also not in the tourney practice room
2014-10-16 02:21:03	@dom	they just don't understand
2014-10-16 07:19:32	aliaras	haha
2014-10-16 07:19:36	aliaras	dom: we should play
2014-10-16 07:20:47	aliaras	dom: also no I never broke even with draft winnings necessarily; what I did do was start going 2-1 in swiss queues so I was at -$6/draft maybe before selling rares, then made more off of selling rares but variable
2014-10-16 07:21:06	aliaras	cards on mtgo are cheaper than IRL, basically always
2014-10-16 07:21:13	aliaras	there are more of them and the market is way more fluid
2014-10-16 07:21:31	aliaras	so my ascendancy deck was maybe $100 on mtgo, most of which I found under the couch
2014-10-16 07:22:00	aliaras	by which I mean I sold every half-decent rare I had that "maybe I'll play sometime" and bought the ascendancy stuff instead
2014-10-16 09:52:00	@dom	heh
2014-10-16 09:52:12	@dom	like I said, I made that janky 4 tix goblin deck
2014-10-16 09:52:20	@dom	wins pretty easily turn 4/5
2014-10-16 09:52:26	@dom	worth like 20 bucks in paper lol
2014-10-16 11:57:06	aliaras	neat
2014-10-16 11:57:11	aliaras	standard or...?
2014-10-16 12:12:17	@dom	modern
2014-10-16 12:12:22	@dom	almost all my decks are modern now
2014-10-16 12:12:51	@dom	also, I found out last monday that I don't actually like EDH
2014-10-16 12:19:28	@relsqui	oh yeah?
2014-10-16 12:19:48	@dom	no consistency
2014-10-16 12:20:02	@dom	"hope you draw a tutor" is not enough to build a deck on
2014-10-16 12:20:18	@dom	the answer is of course "build to a theme" but then you have worse cards
2014-10-16 12:21:58	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-16 12:22:11	@relsqui	that's why I don't expect to like EDH
2014-10-16 12:22:15	@dom	if its a worse card, I dont want to play it
2014-10-16 12:22:26	@relsqui	and I think maybe part of the point for people who've played a lot of constructed is that it's freeing
2014-10-16 12:22:29	@dom	im not totally condemning it, it might be also I wasn't playing with m deck
2014-10-16 12:22:36	@relsqui	you can't make it consistent so you don't have to
2014-10-16 12:22:43	@dom	I want consistency
2014-10-16 12:22:44	@relsqui	(or, alternatively, you have to find more cards that do the thing you want)
2014-10-16 12:22:51	@dom	yeah
2014-10-16 12:22:51	@relsqui	see also why mancat likes multiplayer more than I do
2014-10-16 12:23:11	@relsqui	once it gets big enough he can't track all the possible outcomes/strategy so he no longer has to
2014-10-16 12:23:14	@relsqui	also it becomes a politics game
2014-10-16 12:23:19	@relsqui	which he finds fun and I don't *g*
2014-10-16 12:23:27	@dom	I sometimes find it fun
2014-10-16 12:23:39	@dom	I dislike that you can't play aggro in it very well
2014-10-16 12:23:59	@dom	I like control, and I like some combo
2014-10-16 12:24:10	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-16 12:24:19	@relsqui	the two-player game is very different and I prefer it. tidier.
2014-10-16 12:24:33	@relsqui	reminds me, oddly, of cribbage. my friend stephanie is fond of describing two-player cribbage as the perfect card game
2014-10-16 12:24:46	@relsqui	it's often played with four but it's a different game
2014-10-16 12:26:24	@dom	I think tutors should either get a lot more functional reprints or allowed as multiples in ed
2014-10-16 12:26:28	@dom	edh
2014-10-16 12:26:36	@dom	but that would kill a lot of the fun others get
2014-10-16 12:26:44	@dom	so I'll keep my own tutors over here
2014-10-16 12:27:27	@relsqui	:)
2014-10-16 13:19:17	@dom	mancat: https://deckbox.org/sets/811216
2014-10-16 13:19:34	@dom	its proposed update to my enchantment extort deck
2014-10-16 13:20:05	@dom	mainly using read the bones, more phyrexian arena, exsanguinate, open the vaults for "help they back to nature'd me"
2014-10-16 13:20:19	@dom	and nyx-fleece ram for "help they're trying to aggro"
2014-10-16 13:20:35	@dom	enchantments for hate, as usual

2014-10-18 22:49:37	@relsqui	dom: you were talking about wanting to see a logo in PSU colors -- but of course it has different meaning in a PSU context. how would you feel about gold, with the colored spots?

2014-10-21 03:49:03	@dom	mancat: relsqui I figured out a better way to figure out what kinda decks I like
2014-10-21 03:49:18	@dom	if it runs aether vial as a main card, its a good deck in my book
2014-10-21 06:48:31	aliaras	haha
2014-10-21 11:06:43	@dom	man why isn't this just a functional reprint of spreading seas !card aquitect's will
2014-10-21 11:06:44	oracle	Tribal Sorcery — Merfolk, U (1)
2014-10-21 11:06:44	oracle	Put a flood counter on target land. That land is an Island in addition to its other types for as long as it has a flood counter on it. If you control a Merfolk, draw a card.
2014-10-21 11:07:03	@dom	I would rather just have another spreading seas with conditional "control a merfolk"
2014-10-21 11:07:57	@dom	in other news, I made a merfolk deck
2014-10-21 11:10:45	@relsqui	because it's way harder to remove a random counter than destroy an enchantment
2014-10-21 11:11:28	@dom	thats not why its worse
2014-10-21 11:11:46	@dom	its way worse cuz its "in addition to...."
2014-10-21 11:12:10	@dom	I wanna ruin their lands
2014-10-21 11:12:31	@dom	if they oring/disenchant/golgari charm/whatever my spreading seas, I kek for value cuz of their dead card
2014-10-21 11:13:02	@dom	at least aquitect's will still draws you a card
2014-10-21 11:13:16	@relsqui	you didn't ask why it's worse, you said "why isn't this a function reprint"
2014-10-21 11:13:20	@relsqui	functional*
2014-10-21 11:13:27	@relsqui	I guess you meant "why didn't they choose to"
2014-10-21 11:13:30	@relsqui	and not "in what way is it different"
2014-10-21 11:13:32	@dom	yes
2014-10-21 11:13:46	@dom	I meant "why were they so stupid, I want broken cards not good cards"

2014-10-23 11:23:57	tombat	how long do weekly meetings usually go?
2014-10-23 11:25:28	@dom	6-9 and we usually go to fab after and chillax and eat pizza and watch archer / wakfu / whatever janky anime mancat likes
2014-10-23 11:26:36	tombat	I guess I could probably make it then.

2014-10-23 15:28:53	@dom	but its really just budget60

2014-10-23 17:12:38	@mancat	pauper is commons only

2014-10-23 17:13:30	@mancat	you're approaching it
2014-10-23 17:13:31	@dom	some in the club have comp decks
2014-10-23 17:13:36	@dom	I am, yeah
2014-10-23 17:13:47	@mancat	pauper is competetive at like $200
2014-10-23 17:13:53	@mancat	and the netdecks are strong
2014-10-23 17:14:05	@mancat	and they're all turn 1 or 2 combo decks
2014-10-23 17:14:09	@mancat	with no control to keep it honest
2014-10-23 17:14:12	@dom	yup

2014-10-23 17:30:47	aliaras	but the idea is if anything is too good it gets priced oit

2014-10-24 13:04:43	aliaras	okay so
2014-10-24 13:04:47	aliaras	is this json bad or am I bad at parsing
2014-10-24 13:04:50	aliaras	namely
2014-10-24 13:04:58	aliaras	it's supposed to be key: value right?
2014-10-24 13:05:16	aliaras	I guess every card name can be a different key, but...
2014-10-24 13:05:38	aliaras	this does not work at all with what I'm trying to do
2014-10-24 13:35:56	aliaras	hahHAH I figured out a hack.
2014-10-24 13:40:26	aliaras	and then figured out that there are delimiters in the data :-|

2014-10-25 02:22:07	@relsqui	aliaras: if you are parsing the json yourself manually I am very, very skeptical that you're doing it right
2014-10-25 02:22:18	@relsqui	aliaras: whatever language you are writing in has a library to do that for you.
2014-10-25 09:29:55	aliaras	relsqui: the library was unhappy about the quotes
2014-10-25 09:30:51	aliaras	"this key has a value that is a string, enclosed in ""....what the fuck, e isnt a comma"

2014-10-27 01:22:07	@dom	Im thinking ashcloud phoenix goes away
2014-10-27 01:22:13	@dom	since it says "returns to field"
2014-10-27 01:22:18	@dom	meaning it goes to graveyard
2014-10-27 01:23:11	@relsqui	want me to tell you if you're right/lead you to the right answer/neither and let you think about it?
2014-10-27 01:24:19	@dom	no, just tell me answer
2014-10-27 01:24:36	@relsqui	dom: it depends on whose turn it is
2014-10-27 01:24:51	@relsqui	burn away kills the phoenix
2014-10-27 01:24:53	@relsqui	phoenix goes to yard
2014-10-27 01:24:58	@relsqui	and two triggers immediately go on the stack
2014-10-27 01:25:08	@relsqui	one that says "exile that graveyard" and one that says "return the phoenix to the field"
2014-10-27 01:25:09	@dom	ah yeah

Then, for each attacking creature you control, choose "left" or "right." That creature can't be blocked this combat except by creatures with flying and creatures in a pile with the chosen label.
2014-10-27 06:37:58	aliaras	^ this is the kind of thing that's driving me batty with the mtgjson json
2014-10-27 06:38:29	aliaras	relsqui: was your parser totally fine with that?

2014-10-27 08:32:57	@relsqui	man, we haven't done that in ages, should
2014-10-27 08:33:06	@relsqui	we also just got funding to buy actual booster boxes for draft :D

2014-10-27 08:36:46	@mancat	and consequently i can't decide if it's a misguided non-english speaker or if it's in need of -F SPAM
2014-10-27 08:37:15	@relsqui	it's an illegible google form?
2014-10-27 08:37:18	@relsqui	I'm pretty sure it's spam
2014-10-27 08:39:24	@relsqui	I think I spammed a similar one last night based on the subject line alone
2014-10-27 08:39:38	aliaras	relsqui: yeah so it turns out that the hack I use to work around json and my programming language having slightly different paradigms involves the parser stripping all escapes
2014-10-27 08:39:44	@relsqui	aha
2014-10-27 08:39:50	@relsqui	what lanuage?

2014-10-27 08:40:55	@relsqui	i.e. "nothing you would have heard of"?
2014-10-27 08:40:56	aliaras	yeah
2014-10-27 08:41:14	aliaras	but it's record-based, so it wants the json to be of the form key: value where key: is interpretable as a field name
2014-10-27 08:42:03	aliaras	which the mtgjson isn't; it has "card name: {json array}"
2014-10-27 08:42:19	aliaras	but the stuff *inside* said json array isn't, so I was working around this by saying "ignore unknown keys and give me the values for those keys"
2014-10-27 08:43:26	aliaras	buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut in the process all escapes were getting stripped so i'mma filin' bugs

2014-10-28 01:17:07	@RelsquiescatInPace	right.
2014-10-28 01:17:14	@RelsquiescatInPace	you can destroy either one or two
2014-10-28 01:17:19	@doom	cuz the morbid doesn't trigger *again*
2014-10-28 01:17:33	@RelsquiescatInPace	right.
2014-10-28 01:17:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	morbid adds some conditional rules to the card. the card's rules text is only executed when the spell resolves
2014-10-28 01:18:05	@doom	I see all these cool commander cards, but Im still never going to play commander
2014-10-28 01:18:12	@doom	to casual decks they go
2014-10-28 01:18:14	@RelsquiescatInPace	actually, let me be more precise
2014-10-28 01:18:16	@RelsquiescatInPace	since it matters in this case
2014-10-28 01:18:18	@RelsquiescatInPace	"when you cast"
2014-10-28 01:18:21	@RelsquiescatInPace	^ that's the thing constraining it
2014-10-28 01:19:41	@doom	ob nixilis is hella sick
2014-10-28 01:19:44	@doom	holy shit
2014-10-28 01:19:55	@doom	http://mythicspoiler.com/c14/cards/obnixilisoftheblackoath.html
2014-10-28 01:20:28	@RelsquiescatInPace	whoa.
2014-10-28 01:20:45	@doom	mono black control, its happening
2014-10-28 01:20:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	no shit
2014-10-28 01:21:13	@doom	3 of him, 4 of phyrexian arena, 4 of thoughtseize 4 of $removal 4 of $removal2
2014-10-28 01:21:18	@doom	the deck builds itself
2014-10-28 01:21:37	@doom	if I throw in ways to make hella creatures, I can play hecatomb
2014-10-28 01:21:51	@RelsquiescatInPace	zmobies?
2014-10-28 01:22:38	@doom	zombies require too many cards that dont fit into control
2014-10-28 01:22:56	@doom	I could play that one delve card but I dont think that + hecatomb is actually a good play
2014-10-28 01:23:36	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah
2014-10-28 01:23:42	@RelsquiescatInPace	it's possible this deck doesn't actually need hecatomb :P
2014-10-28 01:24:13	@doom	no, its mono black
2014-10-28 01:24:17	@doom	I owe it to mancat to hecatomb it up
2014-10-28 01:24:25	@RelsquiescatInPace	XD
2014-10-28 01:25:55	@doom	also, im playing mono black control
2014-10-28 01:26:01	@doom	its getting hecatomb, damn it
2014-10-28 01:26:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	XD
2014-10-28 01:26:21	@RelsquiescatInPace	I wouldn't even call hecatomb control. it's, like, burn :P
2014-10-28 01:26:26	@RelsquiescatInPace	but in black because fuck you
2014-10-28 01:27:19	@doom	hecatomb is the win con
2014-10-28 01:27:37	@doom	I could also have that infinite lifedrain enchantment combo in black
2014-10-28 01:27:45	@doom	that I have in my current orzhov kek deck
2014-10-28 01:28:15	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah
2014-10-28 01:28:23	@RelsquiescatInPace	but you still need a way to deal some damage :P
2014-10-28 01:28:35	@RelsquiescatInPace	oh, I gues ob nixilis
2014-10-28 01:28:38	@RelsquiescatInPace	if that's the deck you're building
2014-10-28 01:28:48	@doom	yes
2014-10-28 01:29:04	@RelsquiescatInPace	... oh balls, I got stuck again in this tree
2014-10-28 01:29:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	"has already been played" I have nfi how to tree passive voice
2014-10-28 01:29:38	 *	RelsquiescatInPace looks ahead in the book >_>
2014-10-28 01:29:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	(this is as productive as actually doing my homework, right?)
2014-10-28 01:30:32	@doom	hah
2014-10-28 01:30:51	@doom	im gonna play a bunch of like, "you get double mana from swamps"
2014-10-28 01:30:59	@doom	and super high cmc janky black cards
2014-10-28 01:31:07	@doom	and the rest super tight mono black control
2014-10-28 01:31:10	@doom	itll be great
2014-10-28 01:32:11	@RelsquiescatInPace	that's a lot of slots you're filling there :P
2014-10-28 01:32:53	@RelsquiescatInPace	... omg doom I'm never going to get sick of this halloween nick
2014-10-28 01:33:00	@RelsquiescatInPace	how will I ever change back
2014-10-28 01:34:19	@RelsquiescatInPace	okay, apparently there's a whole concept I'm missing before I can do the passive properly :(
2014-10-28 01:34:29	@RelsquiescatInPace	also it's called theta grids? my field has the best terms I swear
2014-10-28 01:40:37	@doom	all the halloween nicks are way too long
2014-10-28 01:41:41	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah
2014-10-28 01:41:43	@RelsquiescatInPace	I agree
2014-10-28 01:41:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	but you have to admit this one is fucking clever
2014-10-28 01:41:51	@RelsquiescatInPace	(which I take 0 credit for)
2014-10-28 01:42:10	@doom	i just always 100% see the assassin's creed kill screens
2014-10-28 01:42:50	@RelsquiescatInPace	lol
2014-10-28 01:42:52	@RelsquiescatInPace	I can live with that
2014-10-28 01:44:22	@RelsquiescatInPace	whoof. okay, I have a draft of the second half
2014-10-28 01:44:30	@RelsquiescatInPace	"that player may counter the next spell played ..."
2014-10-28 01:44:33	@doom	wat
2014-10-28 01:44:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	doom: I'm redoing that syntax tree
2014-10-28 01:44:42	@RelsquiescatInPace	better. stronger.
2014-10-28 01:44:45	@doom	for what
2014-10-28 01:44:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	and incorporating x' theory
2014-10-28 01:44:52	@RelsquiescatInPace	... for shits and giggles?
2014-10-28 01:44:54	@doom	and also wat
2014-10-28 01:45:00	@doom	whats a syntax tree
2014-10-28 01:45:25	@RelsquiescatInPace	http://i.stack.imgur.com/mGsNb.png
2014-10-28 01:45:28	@RelsquiescatInPace	that's a shitty example
2014-10-28 01:45:30	@RelsquiescatInPace	but you get the idea
2014-10-28 01:45:37	@RelsquiescatInPace	it's a way of analyzing the structure of a phrase
2014-10-28 01:45:58	@doom	what do the letters stand for
2014-10-28 01:46:34	@doom	super nope arbalest of justice no vipers die entrance terraria noperino noobest
2014-10-28 01:46:39	@doom	thats what they stand for
2014-10-28 01:46:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	on that one: Sentence, Noun Phrase, Adjective, Noun, Verb Phrase, Verb, Noun Phrase again, Determiner, Noun
2014-10-28 01:46:49	@doom	I like mine better, you should change it
2014-10-28 01:47:06	@RelsquiescatInPace	basically you can use trees to graph and then analyze how parts of phrases are more closely linked than others
2014-10-28 01:47:13	@RelsquiescatInPace	like "a diagram" is a piece you can swap out as a unit
2014-10-28 01:47:18	@RelsquiescatInPace	e.g. with "cupcakes"
2014-10-28 01:47:26	@doom	for why
2014-10-28 01:47:28	@RelsquiescatInPace	but you can't swap out "make a" and leave "diagram"
2014-10-28 01:47:35	@doom	just to make legos out of sentences?
2014-10-28 01:47:36	@RelsquiescatInPace	there's nowhere you can cut the tree that would make that work
2014-10-28 01:47:43	@RelsquiescatInPace	doom: to understand what's actually going on in the phrase better :)
2014-10-28 01:47:56	@doom	yeah, to take it apart and make a betterone?
2014-10-28 01:48:03	@doom	or knowledge for the halibut
2014-10-28 01:48:05	@doom	?
2014-10-28 01:48:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	I'm trying to come up with a more useful answer than "because it's AWESOME," give me a sec
2014-10-28 01:49:13	@doom	ftr, "for the halibut" is acceptable
2014-10-28 01:49:27	@RelsquiescatInPace	basically, it allows us to form objective, descriptive rules which explain observations about how people already use language.
2014-10-28 01:49:31	@RelsquiescatInPace	it teaches us stuff about our brains
2014-10-28 01:49:32	@RelsquiescatInPace	if you're into that
2014-10-28 01:49:40	@doom	so it is for halibut
2014-10-28 01:49:41	@RelsquiescatInPace	and suggests ways to learn and teach languages better
2014-10-28 01:50:36	@RelsquiescatInPace	I mean, it's quite literally for science :P
2014-10-28 01:50:44	@RelsquiescatInPace	why do we do particle physics?
2014-10-28 01:50:50	@RelsquiescatInPace	this is particle physics for the mind.
2014-10-28 01:52:20	@doom	for sentences
2014-10-28 01:52:23	@doom	for language
2014-10-28 01:52:28	@doom	dont get too full of yourself
2014-10-28 01:52:46	@RelsquiescatInPace	you can't separate language from a human mind without severely damaging the mind.
2014-10-28 01:53:04	@RelsquiescatInPace	it's one of the few things which really does seem to be intrinsic
2014-10-28 01:54:51	@RelsquiescatInPace	this is closer to the kind of tree I'm actually making: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/8/88/20070606073403!Syntax_tree_for_Colorless_Green_Ideas_sleep_furiosly.png
2014-10-28 01:55:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	the X' pieces in the middle are abstract intermediate components which don't seem very useful in a simple tree like that one but turn out to form a better model for the empirical data
2014-10-28 01:56:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	so I'm trying to build one for the rules text of Ambiguity >_> and it's hard because it's really fucking long
2014-10-28 01:57:31	@RelsquiescatInPace	and not terribly syntactically complex, as bits of English prose go, but includes a couple of specific attributes I don't know how to tree properly yet
2014-10-28 01:59:48	@RelsquiescatInPace	okay, I'm done.
2014-10-28 02:01:57	@doom	OK i got it

2014-10-29 10:27:05	stormcrow	Nahiri the Lithomancer, AKA Stoneforged Mystic the Planeswalker is the white deck commander.
2014-10-29 10:27:55	stormcrow	That hits like three different player archetypes in me with massive amounts of joy and happiness
2014-10-29 10:32:44	hylleddin	Interesting, Nahiri has been previously mentioned in relation to Sorin and Zendikar, so this pretty much confirms she is *that* lithomancer.
2014-10-29 10:33:02	hylleddin	Surprised her first appearence is in a supplemental product.
2014-10-29 10:33:13	hylleddin	Maybe she's dead?
2014-10-29 10:33:37	hylleddin	I think all of the other planeswalkers spoiled are either dead or have lost their spark.
2014-10-29 10:35:31	stormcrow	I think her current status in the story is "Unknown"
2014-10-29 10:36:02	stormcrow	There's an uncharted realms story up today that I haven't read yet, though, so that might have more info
2014-10-29 10:40:10	hylleddin	I can't find the story.
2014-10-29 10:40:22	hylleddin	Wizards! Why is your site so horrible now?

2014-10-29 11:37:00	hylleddin	Ob Nixilis just lost his spark. He's alive in Zendikar (stuck as a demon).
2014-10-29 11:37:23	hylleddin	Teferi might still be alive too, what with being a time mage.
2014-10-29 11:37:42	stormcrow	Story has Ob-Nix working on getting it back, I think
2014-10-29 11:38:38	stormcrow	Teferi, being sparkless, hasn't had the story-eye on him since the mending

2014-10-31 16:42:45	@RelsquiescatInPace	I'm thinking about how to set up the draft next week
2014-10-31 16:43:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	specifically, how to pair people
2014-10-31 16:43:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	since we have a pretty wide experience range
2014-10-31 16:44:41	@RelsquiescatInPace	we could look up points, I guess, but probably easier just to sort based on self-reported experience
2014-10-31 16:45:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	no prize support, so no incentive to lie about it >_>
2014-10-31 16:45:40	@dom	yeah

2014-10-31 16:50:26	drbopenstein	So how does this draft thing you're planning work?
2014-10-31 16:50:34	@RelsquiescatInPace	drbopenstein: you've drafted off the cube, yeah?
2014-10-31 16:50:40	@dom	draft like cube draft, where each of the packs is from a different box
2014-10-31 16:50:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	it's like that, but instead of three shuffled piles of cards, it's three unopened packs
2014-10-31 16:50:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	dom: I don't know that we're dead set on doing one of each :P
2014-10-31 16:51:06	@RelsquiescatInPace	if for no other reason, it's not 100% we'll have innistrad by monday

2014-10-31 17:13:24	@dom	itll just be janky khans

2014-11-01 11:43:47	aliaras	okay wait a second
2014-11-01 11:44:21	aliaras	opponent has anafenza the foremost, i have swarm of bloodflies, kheru bloodsucker, and two chumps with toughness >4
2014-11-01 11:44:26	aliaras	my chumps die to an attack
2014-11-01 11:44:42	aliaras	why do I not get either the swarm or the kheru triggers?
2014-11-01 11:45:00	aliaras	Followup: why do I get the swarm trigger when I use a fight card later to trade?
2014-11-01 12:31:45	--	blightfly is now known as nightfly
2014-11-01 13:03:03	@relsqui	aliaras: "die" means "goes to the graveyard from the battlefied." anafenza replaces that event with going to exile.
2014-11-01 13:03:20	aliaras	hrm. nod.
2014-11-01 13:03:40	@relsqui	so your creatures that take damage > toughness just get exiled while anafenza is out
2014-11-01 13:03:49	@relsqui	not triggering either
2014-11-01 13:03:58	@relsqui	but when you fight and trade, the *other* one doesn't get exiled because anafenza doesn't apply to it
2014-11-01 13:04:01	@relsqui	setting off kheru
2014-11-01 13:04:29	@relsqui	I'm not 100% sure I've understood your situation correctly, but off the top of my head that sounds like what might be going on
2014-11-01 13:17:09	aliaras	OHHHHH
2014-11-01 13:17:10	aliaras	yes
2014-11-01 13:17:14	aliaras	Swarm of Bloodflies was the card
2014-11-01 13:17:19	aliaras	that triggered
2014-11-01 13:17:23	aliaras	kheru was the trade card there.
2014-11-01 13:17:35	aliaras	also fight card taking out anafenza: FEELS. GOOD.

2014-11-01 15:19:05	sabreman	this new draft thing we're doing monday
2014-11-01 15:19:18	sabreman	are we gonna have enough cards for everyone?
2014-11-01 15:19:25	sabreman	Or is it a more first-come first-play thing
2014-11-01 15:20:03	@dom	well, we're gonna have a whole booster box
2014-11-01 15:20:09	@dom	for at least 2 sets
2014-11-01 15:20:24	@dom	if you wanna draft, you'll get to play
2014-11-01 15:20:29	@dom	just dont show up late
2014-11-01 15:20:34	@dom	or else we'll start without you
2014-11-01 15:21:03	sabreman	I can only run from the CS lounge so fat!
2014-11-01 15:21:10	sabreman	s/fat/fast
2014-11-01 15:21:22	sabreman	i get out at 6:00, but i'll try to get there quickly
2014-11-01 15:21:51	@dom	I mean getting there before 6:15 will probably be enough
2014-11-01 15:22:03	@dom	but dont show up at like 7 and be like "why'd you start without me"
2014-11-01 15:31:26	@relsqui	yeah, the limiting factor isn't card quantity, it's that it has to start at some point. :P but if you leave the cs lounge around six it'll probably be fine
2014-11-01 15:31:58	@relsqui	I think I'll add that to the post, something like we'll start at 6:30?

2014-11-08 00:54:40	@relsqui	dom: are you interested in taking over discussing logo stuff with amy? you have stronger opinions and I think more interest than I do, and I'm more interested in it getting finished than I am in ever replying to the thread in practice
2014-11-08 00:57:42	@dom	sure
2014-11-08 00:57:52	@dom	forward the latest email to me and tell her >>

2014-11-08 02:18:07	@dom	fyi, for official-y things where people would have no idea why my name is dom, its probably better to refer to me as theodore or teddy >>
2014-11-08 02:18:27	@dom	they'll get it, of course, but just to head off any confusion before it starts, y'know
2014-11-08 02:20:26	@relsqui	yeah, thought crossed my mind *g* figured I'd stick to my default and if it needed sorting it'd get sorted
2014-11-08 02:20:29	@relsqui	but noted
2014-11-08 02:21:05	@dom	kek
2014-11-08 02:21:14	@dom	I sent them an email if you wanna look at it

2014-11-09 17:19:29	@relsqui	haha
2014-11-09 17:21:00	aliaras	also huh, I think the judge was...wrong
2014-11-09 17:21:31	aliaras	more than once it came up (once in a game I was in, once in another game near me): what happens if you Throttle a thing with regnerate?
2014-11-09 17:21:58	aliaras	(s.t. it has toughness < 0)
2014-11-09 17:22:02	@relsqui	throttle?
2014-11-09 17:22:23	aliaras	4B, target creature gets -4/-4 until end of turn
2014-11-09 17:22:31	aliaras	judge said it'd regenerate, but: 704.5f If a creature has toughness 0 or less, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard. Regeneration can’t
2014-11-09 17:22:31	@relsqui	if something has toughness <= 0, as soon as state is checked it dies
2014-11-09 17:22:34	aliaras	replace this event.
2014-11-09 17:22:34	aliaras	yeah.
2014-11-09 17:22:35	@relsqui	yeah, no
2014-11-09 17:22:39	@relsqui	regenerate doesn't get you out of that
2014-11-09 17:22:41	aliaras	yeah.
2014-11-09 17:22:49	@relsqui	unless there was something else going on for some reason
2014-11-09 17:22:51	aliaras	nah
2014-11-09 17:22:59	@relsqui	like, if the effect can only target a creature in battle
2014-11-09 17:23:04	aliaras	(giving your creature +3/+3 until EOT does though :D)
2014-11-09 17:23:06	@relsqui	you can regenerate to remove it from combat and make it an invalid target
2014-11-09 17:23:10	 *	aliaras nods
2014-11-09 17:24:04	aliaras	Relatedly: Rakshasa Deathdealer is a sweet card.
2014-11-09 17:49:33	hylleddin	Wait, does that mean regenerate can get out of, say !card Condemn?
2014-11-09 17:49:33	oracle	The oracle has no time for your games.

2014-11-09 17:49:41	oracle	Put target attacking creature on the bottom of its owner's library. Its controller gains life equal to its toughness.
2014-11-09 17:52:13	@relsqui	if cast in response, yeah
2014-11-09 17:52:31	@relsqui	I mean, actual judges double check me on this
2014-11-09 17:52:45	@relsqui	Golem, mancat: ^
2014-11-09 17:59:59	Golem	no
2014-11-09 18:00:09	Golem	regeneration only applies if the creature is killed
2014-11-09 18:00:39	Golem	so anything else, like exile effects, sac effects and putting the creature into other game zones like the hand or the deck are not effected by regen
2014-11-09 18:18:29	@relsqui	oh, right. doesn't actually do the thing immediately, just creates the replacement effect.

2014-11-11 13:26:33	aliaras	so yeah they got parsed
2014-11-11 13:28:21	relsqui	>_> I would argue that if your thing can't parse punctuation it's not maro's fault
2014-11-11 13:35:38	aliaras	relsqui: it's not, it's the parser's fault-- it strips escaping in a particular case I'm using, I filed a bug but I still wrote my own

2014-11-12 01:35:13	@relsqui	I told it to tell me *when I'm at Time Vault* to buy hard cases and innistrad checklists
2014-11-12 03:20:19	@relsqui	ugh I started working on my ambiguity tree and now it's 3:20
2014-11-12 10:03:45	taron	at least you spent it on something useful instead of what I did which was playing prison architect >_>
2014-11-12 10:04:01	@relsqui	XD useful is a strong word
2014-11-12 10:04:15	@relsqui	so far the net effect of my investment in this project is I have a lot more questions about syntax and I spent $10 on a foil ambiguity

2014-11-12 11:36:26	stormcrow	relsqui: how many checklists do you need? I've got some from Innistrad floating around, and they come in most (all?) Innistrad booster packs

2014-11-12 14:16:02	aliaras	relsqui: I meant for the syntax thingy
2014-11-12 14:16:06	aliaras	so you could be all THIS CARD
2014-11-12 14:17:51	@relsqui	bringing it to what then? :P
2014-11-12 14:17:56	@relsqui	the project has 0% to do with class
2014-11-12 14:21:00	aliaras	oh whoops :p

2014-11-12 18:30:36	@relsqui	okay, so, confirmed that the club can sell things as long as the money stays with the club
2014-11-12 18:30:40	@relsqui	which is easy if we get checks or cash
2014-11-12 18:30:48	@relsqui	but it can't go to an individual's bank account
2014-11-12 18:31:10	@relsqui	I'll ask whether we can hold store credit
2014-11-12 18:32:31	@relsqui	I'm also wondering whether there's any verification of value

2014-11-12 19:27:54	@dom	like they did for cat barcamp?
2014-11-12 19:28:19	@relsqui	it's not a bank account, the foundation account is something else
2014-11-12 19:28:21	@dom	I guess someone would have to be treasurer or financier or something
