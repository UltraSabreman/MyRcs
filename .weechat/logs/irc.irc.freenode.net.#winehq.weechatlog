2013-06-18 23:00:22	sabreman	anyway, has anyone here tried planetside 2 on wine?
2013-06-18 23:00:32	sabreman	I've read the winehq page, it look ok
2013-06-18 23:00:54	sabreman	but i'm just wondering if anyone has actualy played it for a decent amount of time (and not just to test)

2013-06-18 23:47:36	stevenm	Hey, does anyone know a good program (to run in windows or wine) that can record what an installer changes (files, registry entries, etc...)
2013-06-18 23:48:03	stevenm	perhaps even something that watches what an installer installs - and makes you a new unofficial installer that does the same
2013-06-18 23:48:13	stevenm	you see it's the installer (not the app it's installing) that's incompatible with wine

2013-06-19 00:36:58	stevenm	it'd be nice to have something that can re-do what it watches an installer do
2013-06-19 00:37:13	stevenm	if either of those do thta
2013-06-19 00:37:14	stevenm	*that
2013-06-19 00:37:58	Phase4	uh, neither of them are capable of that, no, but procmon supports exporting events as an xml of csv file
2013-06-19 00:38:08	Phase4	can't be too hard to make a thing that replays those
2013-06-19 00:38:54	Phase4	what application is this?

2013-06-19 01:05:48	stevenm	Phase4, is this java application that talks to our phone system - but it stores crap in the windows registry so I can't just run it on the java jre
2013-06-19 01:05:55	stevenm	the installer crashes though
2013-06-19 01:08:38	Phase4	well i'd recommend changing the java application such that it does not require the registry, if that's not an option though :( WINEDEBUG=+warn and WINEDEBUG=+trace are useful but often very noisy
2013-06-19 01:09:54	stevenm	Phase4, it's not an option

2013-06-19 09:31:40	ggherdov	Phase4:  I am beginning a medium C project, and facing the choice of the testing framework (the kind of tests where you "include" the header and call the function under test, to see the output -- so, written in the same language as the project itself). So I am asking around what big C projects use.

2013-06-19 21:23:26	ata	hello. i am back with a couple pf questions. i managed to install my software through playonlinux bottleneck instead of regular wine and it runs well, but i don't know how to add corefonts to make it fully functional. the install packages option doesn't let me do that- it worked for everything else but in case of corefonts it only shows instillation screen for a few seconds and than turns itself off without installing. i used to do it this way
2013-06-19 21:23:31	ata	second question - is there a way to back up the playonlinux bottleneck? in case i need to reinstall system i don't want to try to figure out again what works and what not :)

2013-06-21 14:50:36	lunix	i think the problem is on drivers or some lib. On debian squeeze i had fglrx and gtasa worked. them i uninstalled fglrx and installed the radeon opensource driver and then the game was showing this white screens
2013-06-21 14:51:16	Alikexhi	lunix, need to register to read your paste ?
2013-06-21 14:51:59	lunix	Alikexhi: no
2013-06-21 14:52:15	Alikexhi	lunix, well about wine and games it's adviced to use proprietary drivers
2013-06-21 14:52:34	lunix	Alikexhi: i cant
2013-06-21 14:52:45	Alikexhi	lunix, they stopped supporting your hardware ?
2013-06-21 14:53:07	lunix	Alikexhi: this graphic board inst suported any more
2013-06-21 14:53:30	Alikexhi	lunix, had the same problem with an ATI card...that's why I bought a nvidia card

2013-06-21 14:55:31	Alikexhi	lunix, anyway maybe you can try different wine regedit options about D3d
2013-06-21 14:55:53	Alikexhi	lunix, on direct3D section of this page http://wiki.winehq.org/UsefulRegistryKeys
2013-06-21 14:56:14	lunix	Alikexhi: ill try it
2013-06-21 14:56:37	Alikexhi	lunix, but you must know ATI free drivers work very well with 2D thing (even better than proprietary drivers) but about 3D it's the controry
2013-06-21 14:56:52	Alikexhi	lunix, in all case you will be really limited
2013-06-21 14:57:05	Alikexhi	(by the drivers)
2013-06-21 14:58:01	lunix	Alikexhi: i played well gtasa whith this board and radeon opensource driver
2013-06-21 14:58:54	lunix	Alikexhi: some times it did a little lag but was almost nothing
2013-06-21 14:59:45	Alikexhi	lunix, well maybe you can find a configuration optimized for your drivers and your game with these Direct3D options
