2014-07-06 13:38:51	mancat	i'm torrenting wakfu directly to my thumb drive cuz i'm out of disk space, it's kinda cool to watch the file fragments get written one by one

2014-07-06 13:43:07	mancat	so i don't have to torrent it on campus
2014-07-06 13:43:18	mancat	(because i'm not 100% that it's fully licensed and all)
2014-07-06 13:44:42	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-06 13:47:20	mancat	you know, i have to say
2014-07-06 13:47:33	mancat	this faded, dried-out old leather couch is shockingly comfortable
2014-07-06 13:47:46	mancat	it doesn't look great, but being dry, the leather doesn't stick and cling like leather does on a hot day
2014-07-06 13:47:51	mancat	and it's super soft
2014-07-06 13:49:01	relsqui	nice.

2014-07-06 16:00:19	dom	relsqui: maybe it does, but I have a habit of trying to accrue knowledge about things I like whenever possible
2014-07-06 16:00:34	dom	since usually I figure out how to do stuff on my own, and often the long way
2014-07-06 16:00:50	relsqui	fair enough! well, you're welcome to come to this :)

2014-07-07 12:10:47	relsqui	and it stays inserted for five years so I have a little card reminding me when I have to deal with it again
2014-07-07 12:10:56	relsqui	I have another year and a half of quietly dreading that
2014-07-07 12:10:59	dom	thats helpful
2014-07-07 12:11:01	relsqui	yeah.
2014-07-07 12:11:05	askore	sounds fun
2014-07-07 12:11:23	relsqui	askore: yeah. the insertion was I think the most painful thing I've ever done voluntary
2014-07-07 12:11:31	relsqui	and I say this as someone who a) practices bdsm and b) has genital piercings
2014-07-07 12:11:35	askore	yeah that's what Kona says too.
2014-07-07 12:11:37	askore	the first part

2014-07-07 12:11:43	relsqui	yeah
2014-07-07 12:11:44	askore	I'm still considering it though
2014-07-07 12:11:49	relsqui	oh, yeah, 100% worth it
2014-07-07 12:11:58	relsqui	also, if you plan ahead more than I did you can take a bunch of ibuprofen first
2014-07-07 12:12:04	askore	heh
2014-07-07 12:12:06	relsqui	which is what they tell you to do if you schedule an appointment for it
2014-07-07 12:12:19	relsqui	I didn't, I just inquired about it at a regular appointment and they were like "y'know, after we give you some info, if you decide you want it we can do it right now"
2014-07-07 12:12:36	askore	and you said "hell yeah!" and then pain occurred
2014-07-07 12:12:39	relsqui	basically, yeah
2014-07-07 12:12:42	dom	lol
2014-07-07 12:12:50	relsqui	in between I nerded out with one of the ladies at the clinic about different kinds of long-term birth control
2014-07-07 12:13:03	relsqui	seriously I was like "whoa, you can do that? that's so cool!" and she was like "I know, right?!"
2014-07-07 12:13:06	relsqui	it was fun, haha
2014-07-07 12:13:10	askore	hehe
2014-07-07 12:13:16	relsqui	(also they had rubbery models showing how implants look/feel, etc.)

2014-07-07 12:14:21	relsqui	honestly I think it's worth it just to not menstruate, not getting pregnant is a bonus >_>
2014-07-07 12:14:42	askore	oh totally
2014-07-07 12:14:44	@bajr	although, they make me nervous for totally legitimate reasons
2014-07-07 12:14:54	relsqui	bajr: bonking into one accidentally?
2014-07-07 12:15:01	@bajr	nervous for other people
2014-07-07 12:15:04	relsqui	oh
2014-07-07 12:15:10	askore	haha
2014-07-07 12:15:13	relsqui	:P
2014-07-07 12:15:22	@bajr	no, i've known two people who had them pierce the uterine wall
2014-07-07 12:15:22	dom	i dunno, im more of the "You have an IUD? Uhh can I see proof?"
2014-07-07 12:15:27	relsqui	bajr: D:

2014-07-07 12:15:52	relsqui	dom: eh, if someone said that to me I'd just be like "not easily, but if you'd be more comfortable using a condom that's fine"
2014-07-07 12:15:57	 *	relsqui shrugs
2014-07-07 12:16:11	askore	relsqui: or the mirena card, eh?
2014-07-07 12:16:20	relsqui	askore: except it has my old name on it, so no

2014-07-07 12:16:22	@bajr	I can't fucking wait for male contraception
2014-07-07 12:16:23	askore	ah well yes
2014-07-07 12:16:31	relsqui	also, dunno whether that'd be proof enough
2014-07-07 12:16:42	relsqui	especially since the clinic listed on it doesn't exist any more
2014-07-07 12:16:50	relsqui	because lol planned parenthood funding :(((
2014-07-07 12:17:08	@bajr	vasectomies don't really count, and RISUG has been... 10 years in the making in India?
2014-07-07 12:17:16	relsqui	bajr: yeahh
2014-07-07 12:17:44	relsqui	yeah.
2014-07-07 12:17:45	dom	yeah, and then we could get rid of a lot of terrible court cases
2014-07-07 12:17:47	 *	bajr grumps
2014-07-07 12:18:05	relsqui	tl;dr basically everything about how our culture deals with sex and its consequences is pretty bullshit
2014-07-07 12:18:46	@bajr	indeeb
2014-07-07 12:19:03	dom	well its a touchy subject
2014-07-07 12:19:33	dom	and a lot of situations can be dangerously biased one way or the other, but they're biased for good reason
2014-07-07 12:19:40	relsqui	I mean ... yeah, to some extent, but we make it way worse for ourselves
2014-07-07 12:20:31	dom	I think a lot of it was just doing the best we could at the time, and then never changing
2014-07-07 12:20:45	dom	which describes a lot of problems, in everywhere, not just society...
2014-07-07 12:21:01	relsqui	sure.
2014-07-07 12:21:39	@bajr	anyways, before this delves further down the rabbit hole

2014-07-07 12:22:14	dom	inb4 buffalo spam
2014-07-07 12:23:31	dom	also it isn't a very good comparison, because of the way Mandarin uses tones and inflection
2014-07-07 12:23:37	relsqui	:)
2014-07-07 12:23:47	@bajr	http://youtu.be/vExjnn_3ep4
2014-07-07 12:23:49	dom	in the english sentence, "had" is pronounced the same way, it just means something else
2014-07-07 12:24:08	@bajr	dom: you try listening to this and tell me it sounds different
2014-07-07 12:24:15	dom	I've heard it before bajr
2014-07-07 12:24:19	dom	it does sound different
2014-07-07 12:24:23	relsqui	dom++
2014-07-07 12:24:25	dom	I used to speak some mandarin
2014-07-07 12:24:42	@bajr	likewise, but catching the tones is really hard for me for some reason
2014-07-07 12:24:57	dom	yeah its way different than english
2014-07-07 12:25:14	dom	tones convey emotion more in english, in mandarin they mean different words >>
2014-07-07 12:25:25	dom	afaik anyway
2014-07-07 12:25:34	dom	I never studied the language seriously
2014-07-07 12:25:40	askore	heh
2014-07-07 12:25:42	dom	only enough for certain phrases whilst in country
2014-07-07 12:25:52	askore	this is why I like japanese; all of the syllables are very distinct
2014-07-07 12:25:58	@bajr	they do mean different things
2014-07-07 12:26:01	askore	the hardest one is single versus double vowel
2014-07-07 12:26:45	dom	but china > japan
2014-07-07 12:27:01	askore	uhhh
2014-07-07 12:27:03	askore	ok
2014-07-07 12:27:06	@bajr	like the word "ma" can mean mother, horse, hemp, to scold, or an interrogative punctuation, depending on tone
2014-07-07 12:27:17	jesusaurus	in african languages, tone is often used for grammar
2014-07-07 12:27:30	jesusaurus	as opposed to being lexical
2014-07-07 12:27:40	jesusaurus	language is cool
2014-07-07 12:27:56	dom	turns out we can make different sounds with our mouths
2014-07-07 12:27:58	dom	who knew

2014-07-07 12:29:40	relsqui	haha
2014-07-07 12:29:48	jesusaurus	and those languages also have suprasegmental tones that english has (final fall at the end of a phrase, etc)
2014-07-07 12:30:16	relsqui	makes sense
2014-07-07 12:30:32	relsqui	this is a nice efficient phone tree, I only had to push a couple of buttons before being on hold
2014-07-07 12:30:57	jesusaurus	dom: hahaha
2014-07-07 12:31:11	relsqui	"it's that time of the year again, please talk to your provider about getting a seasonal flu vaccination" ... what?
2014-07-07 12:31:15	relsqui	it's ... it's not that time of the year
2014-07-07 12:31:42	jesusaurus	its always that time of year
2014-07-07 12:31:53	dom	well if you call them now, you can get through by february!

2014-07-07 12:32:51	relsqui	also I should probably eat something before I attempt this phone call or I'm just going to get really grouchy

2014-07-07 13:27:51	 *	askore tries to find something to pass the time
2014-07-07 14:00:43	relsqui	well I successfully wrested information about when I can see an optometrist out of my health care
2014-07-07 14:00:47	relsqui	the answer is "you can't, lol"
2014-07-07 14:01:03	@bajr	-.-
2014-07-07 14:01:08	relsqui	but I have primary health coverage that I 0% need because I still have access to SHAC
2014-07-07 14:03:43	relsqui	I'll get over it but so far I'm still pretty upset about this :/ pretty sure prescription needs updated
2014-07-07 14:09:08	relsqui	and it's basically the only thing I want insurance for right now
2014-07-07 14:09:19	relsqui	besides getting PSU off my back
2014-07-07 14:18:31	dom	if you want I can find where they sleep and maybe send em a message
2014-07-07 14:18:41	dom	something clean, only one or two casualties
2014-07-07 14:19:12	relsqui	if you find a way to stab capitalism itself go for it
2014-07-07 14:20:12	dom	"alright boys, set your phasers to 'societal idiom.'"
2014-07-07 14:21:04	relsqui	dom: <3
2014-07-07 14:21:05	relsqui	thanks.
2014-07-07 14:21:22	relsqui	that makes me feel a little better >_>
2014-07-07 14:22:46	dom	its all i got
2014-07-07 14:22:53	askore	I'm still in a weird inbetween state where I can't tell if I need more caffeine or significantly less
2014-07-07 14:23:01	dom	always more
2014-07-07 14:23:07	dom	then you crash and have less
2014-07-07 14:23:11	dom	all balances out
2014-07-07 14:23:19	askore	I'd like to not crash until I go home for the day
2014-07-07 14:23:49	askore	I seem to have mostly mastered the art of just barely making it to work on time
2014-07-07 14:24:11	askore	now if I had the willpower to stay here for eight hours....
2014-07-07 14:25:36	tamgc	find random things to be excited/distracted by?
2014-07-07 14:25:49	askore	yeah
2014-07-07 14:26:00	askore	there's just nothing going on today
2014-07-07 14:28:01	dom	can you discreetly watch youtube?
2014-07-07 14:28:17	askore	nope
2014-07-07 14:28:58	dom	sucks
2014-07-07 14:29:07	askore	lol
2014-07-07 14:33:42	tamgc	can you indiscreetly watch youtube?
2014-07-07 14:33:47	askore	nope
2014-07-07 14:34:14	tamgc	dwarf fortress?  apparently there was a new version that came out semi recently...
2014-07-07 14:34:26	relsqui	wait I'm skeptical that that's true
2014-07-07 14:34:30	relsqui	like, that it's a bad idea, sure
2014-07-07 14:34:33	tamgc	"It's uh...compiling code..."
2014-07-07 14:34:57	askore	tamgc: well the new one wasn't out as of two or three days ago
2014-07-07 14:35:02	askore	but it's due this week
2014-07-07 14:36:41	tamgc	ah...guess I had the timing wrong
2014-07-07 14:37:55	askore	:)
2014-07-07 14:38:00	askore	I'm looking forward to that though
2014-07-07 14:38:21	stacybird	askore: did you find thing to do?  :-)
2014-07-07 14:38:26	askore	stacybird: not yet :/
2014-07-07 14:38:34	askore	it's a very slow day today
2014-07-07 14:38:50	tamgc	heh "Change one line and the world erupts in no-quarter knife fights apparently... hopefully we've emerged from that."
2014-07-07 14:38:54	askore	hehe
2014-07-07 14:39:59	stacybird	ooooh df....
2014-07-07 14:40:02	stacybird	hm
2014-07-07 14:40:14	stacybird	askore: did you get the dirs cleaned up?
2014-07-07 14:40:17	askore	stacybird: yup
2014-07-07 14:40:34	askore	tried to play with irc bot but got fed up and stopped
2014-07-07 14:41:26	stacybird	ah.  :-(
2014-07-07 14:43:31	askore	I'm shooting for 4:30 go-home time today
2014-07-07 14:43:35	askore	but that's still a ways out
2014-07-07 14:44:30	stacybird	hmmmmmm
2014-07-07 14:44:36	stacybird	what for askore to do.  
2014-07-07 14:44:51	stacybird	find fun oss projects on github?
2014-07-07 14:44:54	stacybird	:D
2014-07-07 14:44:58	askore	hrm
2014-07-07 14:45:02	askore	that is a general goal to have
2014-07-07 15:22:28	askore	*sigh*
2014-07-07 15:22:57	askore	coworker tried to give me something to do, manager came over and basically told him to get back to work, I still have nothing to do.
2014-07-07 15:25:41	stacybird	sigh.
2014-07-07 15:25:55	stacybird	wanna look at charp code with me?  ;-)
2014-07-07 15:25:58	stacybird	haha
2014-07-07 15:26:00	stacybird	c sharp
2014-07-07 15:26:02	askore	lol
2014-07-07 15:26:52	askore	I think that would legitimately be more useful than what I'm doing
2014-07-07 15:26:59	askore	which is dungeon crawl over telnet :/
2014-07-07 15:27:02	stacybird	hahaha
2014-07-07 15:27:09	stacybird	awww
2014-07-07 15:27:12	stacybird	which?
2014-07-07 15:27:15	stacybird	dungeon?
2014-07-07 15:27:20	askore	which what?
2014-07-07 15:27:24	jesusaurus	telnet is dark and you are likely to be eaten by a grue
2014-07-07 15:27:29	askore	*shrug*
2014-07-07 15:27:37	askore	I'm likely to be eaten by something anyway, it's dungeon crawl
2014-07-07 15:27:54	stacybird	Jayme just suggested gitk, wanna go see if it'd be useful to deploy to cat servers?
2014-07-07 15:28:33	stacybird	:-)
2014-07-07 15:28:36	askore	hrrrm?
2014-07-07 15:28:43	 *	stacybird found things for askore to do.  :-P
2014-07-07 15:28:56	stacybird	gitk : http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk
2014-07-07 15:29:00	askore	I see

2014-07-07 15:29:30	stacybird	hehehe
2014-07-07 15:29:38	stacybird	shoulda shortened the img search
2014-07-07 15:29:40	askore	wow that url
2014-07-07 15:29:42	askore	lol
2014-07-07 15:29:53	stacybird	see more htings for you to do to pass time.  ;-)
2014-07-07 15:32:18	askore	I guess
2014-07-07 15:32:38	askore	I shouldn't have to scrounge up stuff to do to pass time at work.... seems like they should have actual useful stuff for me to do
2014-07-07 15:33:08	askore	it's actually really annoying me because I feel super under-valued by it.
2014-07-07 15:33:17	jesusaurus	askore: or maybe they want you working on the things you are interested in...
2014-07-07 15:33:28	jesusaurus	askore: have you read the valve employee handbook?
2014-07-07 15:33:33	askore	jesusaurus: no
2014-07-07 15:33:45	jesusaurus	its shortish and definitely worth the read
2014-07-07 15:34:01	askore	also it's good that they want me to work on things I'm interested in, but what I'm interested in is working on things.
2014-07-07 15:34:09	jesusaurus	http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1074301/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf
2014-07-07 15:38:17	stacybird	maybe you need to ask for access to ALL the THings
2014-07-07 15:38:18	stacybird	:-)
2014-07-07 15:38:21	askore	stacybird: yeah....
2014-07-07 15:38:30	stacybird	like did they ever give you repo access?
2014-07-07 15:38:39	askore	there's not really A repo
2014-07-07 15:38:46	askore	like I haven't seen evidence of ANY repos yet
2014-07-07 15:38:52	askore	all the projects are invisible
2014-07-07 15:39:04	stacybird	hm
2014-07-07 15:39:11	jesusaurus	"projects"
2014-07-07 15:39:23	stacybird	I know there's svn and git so far.
2014-07-07 15:39:29	stacybird	svn == old
2014-07-07 15:39:36	stacybird	git == newer
2014-07-07 15:39:53	stacybird	but as to what is where, my system isn't fully set up yet. 
2014-07-07 15:40:19	stacybird	did you try a search on that tnt page for svn, git, keywords?
2014-07-07 15:40:26	askore	and like, I said "please let me work on DMVPN" but I don't even really have access to tat
2014-07-07 15:40:28	stacybird	might get ya somethin
2014-07-07 15:40:28	askore	that*
2014-07-07 15:40:37	stacybird	yeah
2014-07-07 15:40:50	stacybird	ya gots the skills to use
2014-07-07 15:40:51	askore	I have access to two little servers that only do the PKI stuff
2014-07-07 15:40:56	stacybird	and nothing to use em on
2014-07-07 15:41:01	stacybird	:-)
2014-07-07 15:42:16	 *	stacybird heads home to write more c sharp over icecream
2014-07-07 15:43:40	jesusaurus	stacybird++
2014-07-07 15:44:09	askore	ice cream....
2014-07-07 16:13:20	relsqui	heh. someone in another channel came across a signup form for something which had a gender question with the options "female" "not female"
2014-07-07 16:13:24	relsqui	and is flipping out
2014-07-07 16:13:51	askore	hehe
2014-07-07 16:14:00	askore	I like those options
2014-07-07 16:14:02	jesusaurus	... thats a better binary than 'male' 'female'
2014-07-07 16:14:09	askore	indeed
2014-07-07 16:14:32	relsqui	right?
2014-07-07 16:14:38	relsqui	it's actually more inclusive
2014-07-07 16:14:42	relsqui	but he finds it really sexist and is upset
2014-07-07 16:14:49	askore	 yup
2014-07-07 16:14:51	relsqui	I asked him if it bothers him that most t-shirts come in "people" and "women"
2014-07-07 16:15:19	jesusaurus	my solution: change the options to only "other"
2014-07-07 16:15:34	relsqui	haha, literally the only option?
2014-07-07 16:15:46	askore	yes
2014-07-07 16:15:59	jesusaurus	yeah, literally the only option
2014-07-07 16:16:35	relsqui	I'd be okay with that
2014-07-07 16:17:23	 *	askore too
2014-07-07 16:27:58	dom	I can see why they would be mad at the gender question
2014-07-07 16:28:17	askore	because they're an asshat?
2014-07-07 16:28:23	dom	female and not female makes it seem like they only care if you're female, regardless of how much better it is than male vs female
2014-07-07 16:28:30	dom	I mean they're all bad options
2014-07-07 16:28:52	askore	I mean
2014-07-07 16:29:19	askore	makes it seem like
2014-07-07 16:29:41	askore	"I'm really mad because a website is implying that it doesn't care about my gender because I'm not female!"
2014-07-07 16:30:59	dom	its exactly as bad as "people" vs "women" just biased towards women instead of men
2014-07-07 16:31:18	askore	*shrug*
2014-07-07 16:32:30	dom	*shrug*
2014-07-07 16:32:50	relsqui	dom: I see why you say that, but I think it's not quite the same
2014-07-07 16:32:58	relsqui	and not just for the cultural power reason which is almost always the reason :P
2014-07-07 16:33:13	relsqui	the data they're trying to collect is "are you female"
2014-07-07 16:33:17	relsqui	this is a yes/no question
2014-07-07 16:33:27	relsqui	adding more choices does not improve it
2014-07-07 16:34:01	relsqui	the problem with the t-shirt thing is the implication that unisex is for "everybody," it's the normal/default
2014-07-07 16:34:05	relsqui	and women are different from that
2014-07-07 16:34:11	relsqui	and the survey doesn't do that
2014-07-07 16:34:21	relsqui	it just gives you two choices from which almost everyone can choose unhesitatingly
2014-07-07 16:35:24	relsqui	it's not "normal people" vs. "men" or "normal people" vs. "nonwomen"
2014-07-07 16:35:26	relsqui	just women vs. nonwomen
2014-07-07 16:35:35	relsqui	which is pretty close to a real binary
2014-07-07 16:36:33	relsqui	(and, well, also the cultural power thing but you don't need that reason in this case)
2014-07-07 16:36:59	dom	gotcha, it just sounded like the anti-cultural power which always irks me
2014-07-07 16:37:15	relsqui	how come?
2014-07-07 16:37:25	dom	why it irks me or why it sounded like that?
2014-07-07 16:37:31	relsqui	why's it irk you
2014-07-07 16:37:33	relsqui	I agree that it sounds like it
2014-07-07 16:38:12	dom	because I've had a lot of people tell me during an arguement like that that "equality is when women = everybody else > men"
2014-07-07 16:38:23	dom	and thats their entire arguement
2014-07-07 16:38:26	relsqui	heh
2014-07-07 16:38:35	relsqui	can't speak to that, never heard anyone espouse it
2014-07-07 16:38:57	dom	I think its very close to politics :P
2014-07-07 16:39:17	dom	anyone with a normalalized opinion keeps their trap shut, extremists yell for attention
2014-07-07 16:39:31	relsqui	something like that
2014-07-07 16:39:32	dom	"normalized" being one that isn't just "anti-the other side"
2014-07-07 16:39:35	relsqui	right.
2014-07-07 16:39:46	relsqui	I don't think that's literally true but I know the phenomenon you mean
2014-07-07 16:39:53	dom	oh sure
2014-07-07 16:39:59	 *	relsqui tries to be loudly reasonable
2014-07-07 16:40:04	relsqui	mostly I just succeed in being loud
2014-07-07 16:40:11	dom	loud is not always god
2014-07-07 16:40:12	dom	good
2014-07-07 16:41:10	relsqui	granted
2014-07-07 16:41:14	relsqui	maybe "effective" is a better word
2014-07-07 16:41:49	dom	no, i mean I agree with you from a pov that is different
2014-07-07 16:41:56	dom	I try to be loudly reasonable
2014-07-07 16:42:05	dom	but often I just get into arguement
2014-07-07 16:42:07	dom	arguements
2014-07-07 16:42:25	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-07 16:43:23	dom	which, to be sure, is some of the reason I try to be loud >>
2014-07-07 16:43:29	dom	arguements are how I cement opinions
2014-07-07 16:43:46	relsqui	heh
2014-07-07 16:44:30	dom	which maybe isn't the best way...
2014-07-07 16:45:49	relsqui	I mean, depends on who you're doing it with
2014-07-07 16:45:54	relsqui	if they know that and are participating on purpose, that's one thing
2014-07-07 16:46:30	dom	no, I just argue with anyone
2014-07-07 16:48:10	dom	hey aren't you on tutor duty?
2014-07-07 16:49:24	relsqui	me? no
2014-07-07 16:49:24	relsqui	why?
2014-07-07 16:49:33	dom	oh I thought you were today
2014-07-07 16:49:36	relsqui	nope, tomorrow
2014-07-07 16:49:39	dom	mm
2014-07-07 16:49:57	dom	was gonna be like "if pash happened to show up..."
2014-07-07 16:50:00	dom	maximum kek
2014-07-07 16:51:00	relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-07 16:51:06	askore	it's hot at the bus stop :(
2014-07-07 16:51:11	relsqui	dude if you got the rest of the guys together I'd come down >_> totally worth it
2014-07-07 16:51:14	askore	otoh I'm free :D
2014-07-07 16:51:22	dom	freeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2014-07-07 16:51:32	askore	freeeeeee to go home and clean
2014-07-07 16:51:36	relsqui	askore: yaaaaaaay
2014-07-07 16:51:42	dom	I can guarantee 25% of "the guys" can be there on short notice

2014-07-07 17:08:32	askore	heh
2014-07-07 17:08:35	relsqui	haha
2014-07-07 17:09:46	askore	although, this will make for a nice empty bus during rush hour
2014-07-07 17:10:05	askore	since 90% of people will try to get on the express
2014-07-07 17:11:00	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-07 17:11:42	relsqui	hoom
2014-07-07 17:12:02	relsqui	I wish I had speakers
2014-07-07 17:12:09	relsqui	so I could blast catradio and clean my room
2014-07-07 17:12:19	relsqui	might be worth it to hook up the one busted speaker I have
2014-07-07 17:12:58	askore	aha
2014-07-07 17:13:00	askore	excellent

2014-07-07 17:36:24	@bajr	Corax: >.>.... yes?
2014-07-07 17:36:47	jesusaurus	giggity

2014-07-07 17:37:24	relsqui	<_<
2014-07-07 17:41:05	relsqui	lol, I spend most of my time in #xkcd-signal reassuring people that they don't have to overexert themselves as much as they think to avoid getting muted
2014-07-07 17:41:14	relsqui	you can just talk, usually, and as long as you're not being super cliched or contentless you're fine
2014-07-07 17:41:58	relsqui	(this is the channel with bot-enforced originality: if you say something anyone else has ever said before, it mutes you temporarily)
2014-07-07 17:42:45	dom	I imagine you can't laugh
2014-07-07 17:42:48	dom	"heh"
2014-07-07 17:42:51	dom	-> muted
2014-07-07 17:42:52	relsqui	where "anyone else has ever said before" means in the entire history of the channel, or in #xkcd before that
2014-07-07 17:42:55	relsqui	yep
2014-07-07 17:43:15	relsqui	so it's got about seven years of logs to go on now
2014-07-07 17:44:02	jesusaurus	that cuts back on the "lol"s
2014-07-07 17:44:08	relsqui	right
2014-07-07 17:44:22	relsqui	it was a lot of fun early on when a lot of new people were stumbling in who didn't know how it worked yet
2014-07-07 17:44:27	relsqui	most common first three mutes
2014-07-07 17:44:28	relsqui	"hi"
2014-07-07 17:44:29	relsqui	"wtf"
2014-07-07 17:44:31	relsqui	"why did I get muted"
2014-07-07 17:45:24	relsqui	(this is on irc.foonetic.net if you wanna come say hi)

2014-07-07 17:46:01	relsqui	mancat: speaking of which, I found out what the difference is between those two, if you're curious
2014-07-07 17:47:33	relsqui	mancat: or rather, why it didn't in your experience work the way I thought it should work
2014-07-07 18:12:48	@bajr	heh r9k for irc

2014-07-07 18:28:15	nightfly	do you hold your hands out to the side and everything?
2014-07-07 18:29:37	askore	yeah
2014-07-07 18:29:39	askore	of course
2014-07-07 18:29:49	askore	sometimes I even hold like moderately heavy stuff as if I was swinging around the handles
2014-07-07 18:29:55	askore	but that feels EXTRA silly
2014-07-07 18:31:49	nightfly	lol
2014-07-07 18:49:50	relsqui	you could get a purse and swing it

2014-07-07 19:37:52	stacybird	hm, maybe mint would add well
2014-07-07 19:38:13	relsqui	..... hey, wait a minute
2014-07-07 19:38:21	relsqui	mancat: rereading the first line of this one since last quarter http://oglaf.com/obligationday/
2014-07-07 22:43:52	relsqui	huh second take at these vegan kielbasa is better
2014-07-07 22:43:57	relsqui	partly probably because I know more what to expect
2014-07-07 22:44:06	relsqui	but also I'm eating them more like how they are expecting to be eaten
2014-07-07 22:44:15	relsqui	(browned whole and then on bread)
2014-07-07 22:44:21	relsqui	relatedly, how does my house have six kinds of mustard and no ketchup
2014-07-07 23:43:52	 *	nightfly just cooked up a bag of microwavable pork rinds

2014-07-08 00:18:26	nightfly	Very, very good. Way better than regular porkrinds while they are still warm.
2014-07-08 00:19:03	nightfly	They come out almost sizzling but because they are so puffed up you can eat them almost immediately

2014-07-08 00:58:31	relsqui	er, and ownership of a bicycle
2014-07-08 00:58:34	relsqui	important component

2014-07-08 08:38:14	 *	askore also gets free oscon expo hall pass and pokes y'all to do the same
2014-07-08 08:38:24	askore	go forth and get swag/jobs/internships!
2014-07-08 08:53:52	tamgc	swajernships!
2014-07-08 08:54:35	askore	yes
2014-07-08 08:54:49	askore	although really that word is just a description of a good internship
2014-07-08 08:54:55	askore	if an internship gets you swag and a job, it is good.
2014-07-08 09:06:23	tamgc	pshaw, I *bring* the swag
2014-07-08 09:06:27	tamgc	>.> <.<
2014-07-08 09:06:47	tamgc	but yes, that would be a good internship
2014-07-08 09:06:58	tamgc	also apparently Slim's going to be ADP'ing too?
2014-07-08 09:09:24	askore	indeed
2014-07-08 09:09:44	askore	elsewhere but we see him at intern events and such
2014-07-08 09:58:32	askore	hehehe
2014-07-08 09:59:06	 *	askore finishes reading the valve new employee handbook
2014-07-08 09:59:20	askore	the glossary at the end is hilarious, and it also makes some good points about T-shaped people
2014-07-08 09:59:40	askore	aka "I have approximate knowledge of many things, and obsessive knowledge of this one speific thing"
2014-07-08 10:01:21	jesusaurus	yay, glad you enjoyed it
2014-07-08 10:01:49	askore	yep! jesusaurus++
2014-07-08 10:13:00	@bajr	mancat: I will join you in cat biking subculture! ...when I get back

2014-07-08 10:13:53	askore	I will try to get swag for you
2014-07-08 10:14:33	@bajr	yes plz
2014-07-08 10:14:45	@bajr	I will bring you guys alaska stuff
2014-07-08 10:14:48	askore	:D
2014-07-08 10:15:01	@bajr	the mountains there are made of quartz :)
2014-07-08 10:15:09	 *	bajr isn't even lying
2014-07-08 10:15:35	askore	oo that's pretty cool
2014-07-08 10:16:28	askore	can't wait for sushi for lunch~
2014-07-08 10:32:04	tamgc	heh, the "T" thing reminded me of dabah's "+" (think graph axis) thing, the X-axis line being general users, and the upper Y-axis being higher level layer 8/9 stuff (lower Y-axis sort of going down the OSI stack)
2014-07-08 10:32:35	askore	general users?
2014-07-08 10:33:09	tamgc	dealing with the general luser, sort of like fronkdesk stuff
2014-07-08 10:33:26	askore	ah I see
2014-07-08 10:33:34	tamgc	so the better at deskcating, the wider that area of amorpheus blob it is
2014-07-08 10:34:23	tamgc	then the better you deal with layer 8/9, the bigger a peak you get, and more deeply you delve into the technical things, the more you peak that way too
2014-07-08 10:34:47	tamgc	(amorphous*)
2014-07-08 10:34:54	askore	amorpheus hehe
2014-07-08 10:35:21	tamgc	so as a "well-rounded" sys admin, you end up with sort of a circle from 0,0 if you look at it like a graph
2014-07-08 10:35:31	askore	literally, round
2014-07-08 10:35:35	tamgc	yep heh
2014-07-08 10:35:58	tamgc	although you can get away with just being mostly T-ish shaped
2014-07-08 10:36:29	tamgc	and bigger the env, the more specialized you can be
2014-07-08 10:38:01	tamgc	(can also think of top half as more HISSen, and lower half as CLAWs)
2014-07-08 10:38:15	askore	yep
2014-07-08 10:38:31	askore	really I was more puzzled about the x-axis >.>
2014-07-08 10:38:51	askore	since "the y-axis is the osi stack" makes sense
2014-07-08 10:40:17	tamgc	yeah, X-axis being the wide range of types of users and problems you have to deal with as a deskcat is how I've always envisioned it, and most zombies/katzen end up being a T in one direction or another or a very oval-shaped deskcat
2014-07-08 10:40:48	tamgc	...which sounds funny... ("oval-shaped deskcat" >.>)
2014-07-08 10:41:10	askore	heh
2014-07-08 10:45:37	 *	askore is hungry...

2014-07-08 12:40:40	tamgc	I think there were a couple of katzen that had "food" hilighted for a while >.> <.<
2014-07-08 12:40:51	askore	or "free food"
2014-07-08 12:42:06	tamgc	or tamgc++ heh
2014-07-08 12:42:41	tamgc	that reminds me, I need to do a food run sometime in the near future
2014-07-08 12:42:50	askore	food is good, yeah
2014-07-08 12:42:53	tamgc	been a while
2014-07-08 12:45:38	dom	food?
2014-07-08 12:45:46	tamgc	food.
2014-07-08 12:46:07	dom	I want different text sizes so I can convey tone and emotion in irc :<
2014-07-08 12:46:23	askore	caps lock
2014-07-08 12:46:24	tamgc	and I can do like a mid-Monday run too instead of morning since I switched to 4x10 for summer...
2014-07-08 12:46:40	dom	askore: I want small text
2014-07-08 12:46:46	askore	(in parentheses)
2014-07-08 12:47:04	dom	(that means talking behind your hand in my head)
2014-07-08 12:47:13	dom	also not what I want
2014-07-08 12:47:15	askore	the text doesn't have to literally be small, it can just be small in your head
2014-07-08 12:47:23	askore	or like, a small voice
2014-07-08 12:47:28	dom	no, if its not small in irc it doesn't convey the same message
2014-07-08 12:47:56	tamgc	tag it <tiny_voice> or something =P
2014-07-08 12:48:12	askore	or grey text, which blends in slightly with a white or black background
2014-07-08 12:48:19	askore	making the text less visible and therefore quieter
2014-07-08 12:48:30	dom	but not actually smaller
2014-07-08 12:48:42	askore	that
2014-07-08 12:48:43	tamgc	or change the font size on your term >.> <.<
2014-07-08 12:48:45	askore	is a personal problem
2014-07-08 12:48:47	askore	yes
2014-07-08 12:48:55	dom	thats not what I want at all >>
2014-07-08 12:55:30	tamgc	ˢᵘᵖᵉʳˢᶜʳࠗᵖᵗ ᵘⁿࠗᶜᵒᵈᵉ? (the superscript 'i' appears b0rked on my end...)
2014-07-08 12:55:36	askore	yep
2014-07-08 12:55:39	askore	same on my end
2014-07-08 12:56:25	 *	tamgc blames dom
2014-07-08 12:56:57	dom	they're all borked on my end :P
2014-07-08 12:57:17	askore	also subscript unicode would probably have a better effect
2014-07-08 12:57:20	dom	except for s and r, so I asssume that sentence is "super script text?"
2014-07-08 12:57:30	askore	yeah

It's an endless flat gray swamp of telling-not-showing, grammatical abominations, and complete poverty of imagery.  I've seen more color and texture in a sheet metal catalogue.  I've gotten more aesthetic enjoyment out of minor surgery.  I've felt more engrossed in the prose of IKEA assembly directions.  And literally the only

2014-07-08 23:38:19	jesusaurus	relsqui: can you give me a little more context?
2014-07-08 23:38:31	relsqui	no because I need to go catch a bus, but I can in ~30m
2014-07-09 00:12:29	relsqui	jesusaurus: I said something in passing about how IT isn't really my field; you asked what I did want to do, and I was talking about language and programming and procedural generation of beautiful prose
2014-07-09 00:12:40	relsqui	you looked thoughtful and said you might have a lead for that
2014-07-09 00:12:43	relsqui	or something like that
2014-07-09 01:31:22	relsqui	I think the actual answer might be games or art. it's increasingly difficult to imagine being satisfied by work that isn't about making people happier in an immediate sense.

2014-07-10 08:19:58	relsqui	tl;dr previous reports of homestar runner returning were an april fool's prank, but so many people wanted it to be true that now it is
2014-07-10 08:24:57	askore	mmmrrrr
2014-07-10 08:25:02	 *	askore tried to look at upcoming braindumps
2014-07-10 08:25:14	askore	literally the only ones scheduled between now and orientation are the puppet ones
2014-07-10 08:27:51	tamgc	yay puppet shows?
2014-07-10 08:28:19	tamgc	(random thought, would be neat to have a light-weight version of puppet, named bunraku... >.>)
2014-07-10 08:28:27	askore	heh
2014-07-10 08:28:39	askore	tamgc: lightweight in what way?
2014-07-10 08:29:08	tamgc	more towards ansible?
2014-07-10 08:30:16	askore	I haven't messed with ansible before
2014-07-10 08:31:47	tamgc	it's been a while since I looked at conf mgmt stuff...but iirc, it's essentially a really basic yaml conf mgmt tool
2014-07-10 08:31:59	askore	ooh, agentless
2014-07-10 08:32:01	askore	that's interesting
2014-07-10 08:32:16	tamgc	ah yeah, that too
2014-07-10 08:32:41	askore	I should find time to play with it
2014-07-10 08:33:11	tamgc	it's a decent tool if you need simple conf mgmt...
2014-07-10 08:33:14	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 08:33:27	askore	it sounds attractive for laptop management, etc
2014-07-10 08:34:40	askore	hmm I should get a breakfast thing
2014-07-10 08:34:47	askore	before standup
2014-07-10 08:36:46	tamgc	food++
2014-07-10 08:40:41	askore	yep, also tea++ especially earl grey
2014-07-10 08:48:18	 *	bajr goes fishing

2014-07-10 08:48:30	@bajr	it's time for salmon
2014-07-10 08:48:35	askore	bajr: gonna bring back some fishies to share?
2014-07-10 08:48:39	askore	smoked salmon?

2014-07-10 08:49:02	askore	hehe
2014-07-10 08:49:30	@bajr	askore: depends if i actually catch anything
2014-07-10 08:49:49	tamgc	bring back a grizzly
2014-07-10 08:49:50	askore	\o/ there's hope then
2014-07-10 08:50:04	@bajr	tamgc: Shall do
2014-07-10 08:50:08	tamgc	\o/
2014-07-10 08:50:32	@bajr	the clouds are very low today, looks awesome
2014-07-10 08:53:51	tamgc	psst, I think that's called "fog" >.> <.<
2014-07-10 08:54:18	askore	you can have low clouds without it being fog
2014-07-10 08:54:41	askore	although yes if you were on a mountain it would probably become fog
2014-07-10 08:58:51	tamgc	(I know, was just making a joke...)
2014-07-10 08:58:54	tamgc	karmabot: my razor
2014-07-10 08:58:54	karmabot	What?
2014-07-10 08:58:59	tamgc	karmabot: tamgc's razor
2014-07-10 08:58:59	karmabot	Huh?
2014-07-10 08:59:02	tamgc	boo
2014-07-10 08:59:35	tamgc	karmabot: tamgc's razor is when in doubt, the answer is the more amusing one
2014-07-10 08:59:35	karmabot	Huh?
2014-07-10 09:00:04	tamgc	karmabot: (tamgc's razor) is when in doubt, the answer is the more amusing one
2014-07-10 09:00:04	karmabot	Alright, tamgc.

2014-07-10 11:55:20	askore	stacybird: http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/exams/list/icnd1b.html#~Topics
2014-07-10 13:08:05	tamgc	so...not sure if you guys can get ADP to spring for it, but it's like $100/person/year subscription that we have here for ine.com that has a bunch of online videos for cisco training stuff...
2014-07-10 13:08:44	tamgc	they actually have pretty solid videos and breakdown of subjects
2014-07-10 13:09:23	tamgc	err $100/person/month
2014-07-10 13:09:34	tamgc	for their "All Access Pass"
2014-07-10 13:09:50	tamgc	free 5 day trial avail apparently: http://www.ine.com/all-access-pass-subscription.htm
2014-07-10 13:10:13	askore	ah nice
2014-07-10 13:10:40	askore	yeah I have study guides for the previous version of the exam, and I don't think they're very different
2014-07-10 13:10:52	askore	like... the new one requires more detailed knowledge of IPv6, stuff like that
2014-07-10 13:10:59	tamgc	yeah...cisco things don't really change much over time
2014-07-10 13:11:13	askore	yep
2014-07-10 13:11:22	askore	turns out that vlans are just as relevant today as they always have been
2014-07-10 13:11:51	tamgc	was going to transcribe some training materials/labs to GNS3 at one point, but time and all that...
2014-07-10 13:11:59	tamgc	heh yeah
2014-07-10 13:12:03	askore	gns3 so cool
2014-07-10 13:12:08	askore	I just got it set up
2014-07-10 13:12:44	tamgc	https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/43019
2014-07-10 13:12:52	askore	the books came with some software that looks a lot like gns3 that is probably for exactly that purpose
2014-07-10 13:13:38	tamgc	yeah, there's like an (un)official for-pay one that's called Packet Tracer
2014-07-10 13:13:53	askore	heh
2014-07-10 13:14:10	askore	that sounds like something rather different
2014-07-10 13:14:18	tamgc	I forget the details, but it's some weird licensing dance that happened with cisco and some training company or somesuch
2014-07-10 13:14:38	askore	mmhm
2014-07-10 13:14:43	tamgc	ah "Cisco Networking Academy"
2014-07-10 13:15:17	tamgc	have to be registered with them for that
2014-07-10 13:15:47	askore	this says "CCNA 640-802 network simulator"
2014-07-10 13:15:56	askore	*shrug*
2014-07-10 13:16:04	tamgc	(and yeah, it sounds like a networking util heh...but it's another emulator prog)
2014-07-10 13:16:11	askore	yup
2014-07-10 13:19:45	tamgc	looks like the gns3 kickstart program for full dev just got to their alpha8 release
2014-07-10 13:22:35	tamgc	http://hackingcisco.blogspot.com/ may be useful too btw
2014-07-10 13:26:16	askore	ooh!
2014-07-10 18:57:03	askore	huh
2014-07-10 18:57:25	askore	it's slowly dawning on me that I have almost all of my last paycheck still in the bank, and there's another one coming in a week
2014-07-10 18:57:33	 *	relsqui grins
2014-07-10 18:57:36	askore	0-o I actually have??? disposable income???
2014-07-10 18:57:36	relsqui	real jobs!
2014-07-10 18:57:39	askore	yeah!!!
2014-07-10 18:58:07	askore	also in a few days I will receive a credit card - woah real adult business over here
2014-07-10 18:58:19	jesusaurus	askore: to the kickstarter!
2014-07-10 18:58:25	askore	hehe
2014-07-10 18:58:29	jesusaurus	thats where i dump a bunch of money
2014-07-10 18:58:39	jesusaurus	that and student loans :(
2014-07-10 18:58:42	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 18:58:53	askore	I don't spend much on kickstarted because 1) money, 2) extremely delayed gratification
2014-07-10 19:00:10	 *	relsqui crosses eyes at GIMP
2014-07-10 19:00:27	relsqui	I have a layer with a bunch of gray on it, why is lowering the brightness not making it black
2014-07-10 19:00:30	 *	relsqui missing something
2014-07-10 19:00:44	jesusaurus	does that grey represent transparent?
2014-07-10 19:00:50	jesusaurus	thats usually checkerbox grey
2014-07-10 19:01:04	relsqui	nah, but you're half right ... it's just mostly-transparent black
2014-07-10 19:01:09	askore	heh
2014-07-10 19:01:10	relsqui	because I did a white-to-alpha on it
2014-07-10 19:01:16	jesusaurus	heh
2014-07-10 19:01:21	relsqui	hmm
2014-07-10 19:03:31	relsqui	trying to figure out how to do the part I mean in reverse
2014-07-10 19:17:46	relsqui	oh hey 8) I muttered about that in the right channel and someone just straight-up told me. neat.
2014-07-10 19:34:52	jesusaurus	if a- is a negating prefix, then is a apathetic the opposite of pathetic?
2014-07-10 19:42:53	relsqui	...
2014-07-10 19:42:58	 *	relsqui to the etymobile
2014-07-10 19:43:28	relsqui	oh, actually, I bet it is though; I bet they both come from pathos
2014-07-10 19:43:43	relsqui	yep
2014-07-10 19:43:44	tamgc	*ahem* discretionary income =P
2014-07-10 19:43:59	relsqui	<_< you are fooling no one
2014-07-10 19:44:54	tamgc	(disposable is after tax, so basically net income, discretionary is after paying off obligations)
2014-07-10 19:45:05	relsqui	ah
2014-07-10 19:45:07	askore	I see
2014-07-10 19:45:10	askore	that's a confusing distinction
2014-07-10 19:45:25	tamgc	yeah, doesn't help most people call it disposable income
2014-07-10 19:45:38	tamgc	which in theory it all is after a paycheck...you can not pay your rent or whatnot...
2014-07-10 19:45:46	tamgc	or bills...
2014-07-10 19:46:28	askore	I guess you could not HAVE bills but it doesn't really work to just not pay them
2014-07-10 19:46:36	relsqui	I mean, it does
2014-07-10 19:46:39	relsqui	it just might not have an outcome you desire
2014-07-10 19:46:43	askore	ah sure
2014-07-10 19:47:32	tamgc	but overall... \o/ congrats, you have some monies! heh
2014-07-10 19:50:21	relsqui	\o/
2014-07-10 19:51:57	 *	tamgc would generally suggest having at least a couple thousand liquid as a rainy-day thing...but also depends on what obligations you can potentially have -.-
2014-07-10 20:17:02	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 20:17:33	askore	I'll probably put a bunch of this away where it will make more money than sitting in savings
2014-07-10 20:21:03	tamgc	yeah, anything beyond what you feel like needs to be liquid should probably be invested on some level
2014-07-10 20:22:25	 *	tamgc tends to have varying levels of liquidness of money dependent on how much shit-hitting-the-fan I'd expect to happen 
2014-07-10 20:23:11	tamgc	and generally the less liquid, the more returns I'd expect
2014-07-10 20:23:15	dom	I have $400 liquid, too bad its also eating budget
2014-07-10 20:23:24	dom	for the rest of time
2014-07-10 20:23:40	tamgc	credit unions tend to have decent interest bearing acct levels...for checking/savings accts
2014-07-10 20:23:48	tamgc	dom: food is pretty important=)
2014-07-10 20:24:20	 *	relsqui similar to dom except that number is larger because it's also rent and bills
2014-07-10 20:24:47	tamgc	gotten bitten in the ass before having to try to xfer money to my sister in an emergency situation...because there are limits to how much you can move electronically...so I tend to be a bit more paranoid these days...
2014-07-10 20:24:53	tamgc	so take with a grain of salt
2014-07-10 20:26:11	askore	tamgc: oh it's definitely better interest than a lot of things, but it can do much better in an ira.
2014-07-10 20:26:40	tamgc	generally I think up to: few hundred cash (food/gas/lending), few thousand saving/checking (covering bills), and then whatever else
2014-07-10 20:26:41	dom	relsqui: that number is 400 because I paid spring's rent
2014-07-10 20:26:54	dom	oh yeah now I have to pay summer
2014-07-10 20:27:09	tamgc	askore++ yep
2014-07-10 20:27:27	tamgc	also if employers match contributions, it's pretty nice
2014-07-10 20:28:18	tamgc	like OUS automatically contributes 6% to PERS...which last year had about 15% growth rate so that was nice "free" money
2014-07-10 20:28:45	relsqui	dom: yeah, for me it would be about the same if I did rent in advance
2014-07-10 20:28:55	tamgc	(need to work for OUS for 5 years to get vested to be able to get the full amount...)
2014-07-10 20:31:10	tamgc	(also, Roth IRAs tend to be a better choice imo, since you get the tax break when you withdraw...so basically any growth is also untaxed)
2014-07-10 20:31:54	askore	ah yeah it is a roth ira
2014-07-10 20:34:00	tamgc	askore++ noice...feeling oddly proud that you're dealing with finances so well even though I have nothing to do with it heh
2014-07-10 20:34:29	askore	hahah
2014-07-10 20:34:31	askore	:D
2014-07-10 20:34:52	tamgc	(so few people seem to deal with money well -.-)
2014-07-10 20:35:10	askore	yeah after last summer my dad & grandpa held a council of elders and came up with "roth ira", and that's where the excess from the last internship went
2014-07-10 20:35:43	tamgc	(askore elders)++ heh
2014-07-10 20:35:54	tamgc	or "seniors" maybe >.> <.<
2014-07-10 20:35:57	askore	hahaha
2014-07-10 20:35:59	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 20:40:38	tamgc	(oh and on the flip side, don't be afraid of using discretionary income on things that'll improve quality of life...some people end up trying to save so much they end up living miserably...and that can get caustic -.-)
2014-07-10 20:41:22	tamgc	be a financial druid I guess >.> <.<
2014-07-10 20:41:31	tamgc	(and then money would grow on trees...)
2014-07-10 20:58:41	askore	hmm yes, financial druid... I can aspire to be that
2014-07-10 20:59:31	 *	askore thinks druidism is generally really cool
2014-07-10 21:28:48	 *	tamgc not sure if classic druidism, neo-druidism, or RPG druidism...
2014-07-10 21:33:28	askore	well all of them, for different reasons
2014-07-10 21:34:01	askore	but mostly this is like in middle school when people would get really obsessed with horses or wolves or whatever
2014-07-10 21:50:30	tamgc	ah, sounds more neo-druidism/paganism... (classic being more a mix of sagely/seer/potentially religious)
2014-07-10 21:51:02	tamgc	and RPG being more magic oriented...at least that's how I categorize them
2014-07-10 21:53:18	tamgc	vs more naturalism of neo-druidism/paganism
2014-07-10 21:55:13	askore	yep. But also my favorite King Arthur novel has Merlin as a druid, and it's super interesting
2014-07-10 21:57:48	tamgc	that...seems to make more sense than him being some wizard...
2014-07-10 21:58:08	askore	haha yeah!
2014-07-10 21:58:41	askore	and Morgana is welsh and 
2014-07-10 21:58:43	askore	I <3 it
2014-07-10 21:59:08	askore	I think there's more than one book in the series but I never pursued it past the first, since I read it when I was maybe 14 and didn't think about there maybe being more
2014-07-10 22:01:17	tamgc	do you remember what the book was called?
2014-07-10 22:01:44	tamgc	(...commonly refered to as 'title' >.> <.< *head desk*)
2014-07-10 22:04:25	askore	haha
2014-07-10 22:04:34	askore	sword of the rightful ji
2014-07-10 22:04:36	askore	er
2014-07-10 22:04:38	askore	king*
2014-07-10 22:05:45	askore	I didnt really think about what I read as a kid... I read manga once when I was like 8, got through an entire volume without realizing I read it backwards
2014-07-10 22:05:56	askore	I just thought the storyline was really confusing
2014-07-10 22:06:01	tamgc	"Sword of the Rightful Asian terrorist group" doesn't have the same ring -.- ("ji"...)
2014-07-10 22:06:03	askore	also I didnt read most of the words
2014-07-10 22:06:06	askore	lol
2014-07-10 22:06:11	askore	no, its king
2014-07-10 22:06:19	 *	tamgc points to razor =)
2014-07-10 22:06:23	askore	yes
2014-07-10 22:06:47	askore	it also took me years to figure out that the hobbit had a sequel
2014-07-10 22:06:57	tamgc	haha
2014-07-10 22:07:04	askore	YEARS
2014-07-10 22:07:12	askore	like, after I watched the movies
2014-07-10 22:07:32	askore	I didnt put two and two together until I reread the hobbit
2014-07-10 22:07:34	askore	:P
2014-07-10 22:07:36	tamgc	to be fair, the connection is kind of easy to miss...
2014-07-10 22:07:52	askore	sure, easier if you know theyre by the same guy
2014-07-10 22:07:55	tamgc	especially with the different tone of the books
2014-07-10 22:08:00	tamgc	also that
2014-07-10 22:08:20	askore	yep
2014-07-10 22:08:50	askore	I wish I read as much as I did in middle school
2014-07-10 22:09:00	askore	I'd have NO backlog if I did
2014-07-10 22:09:11	tamgc	kind of wondering if there are manga out there that would be able to make sense forward and back now...
2014-07-10 22:09:15	askore	also would probably live in powells
2014-07-10 22:09:23	askore	hrm
2014-07-10 22:09:45	askore	not an answer to your statement but sometimes manga is printed reflected
2014-07-10 22:09:48	tamgc	there's a thing called a library...=) also you can always get a kindle or something
2014-07-10 22:10:05	askore	yeah I dont like reading on a kimdle though
2014-07-10 22:10:07	askore	its fiddly
2014-07-10 22:10:24	askore	and yes library.
2014-07-10 22:10:34	askore	I should get on that.
2014-07-10 22:10:49	tamgc	not like ADP has you doing anything anyways >.>
2014-07-10 22:11:31	askore	:)
2014-07-10 22:11:33	askore	there is stuff
2014-07-10 22:11:46	askore	its just consistently blocked on the support guys
2014-07-10 22:11:53	tamgc	but more seriously, bus...book...tends to work well =)
2014-07-10 22:11:54	askore	hence the cisco
2014-07-10 22:11:59	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 22:13:11	tamgc	cisco thing is at least something
2014-07-10 22:13:22	tamgc	oh that reminds me...did the erase ever finish?
2014-07-10 22:13:30	askore	yeah lol
2014-07-10 22:13:42	askore	now I just have to get the image on somehow
2014-07-10 22:13:55	tamgc	tftp all the things is generally how cisco does it
2014-07-10 22:14:01	nibalizer	haha
2014-07-10 22:14:15	tamgc	i forget if the asa 5500s have usb ports, but that's probably saner
2014-07-10 22:14:24	askore	yeah
2014-07-10 22:14:32	askore	but if that works in rommon idk
2014-07-10 22:14:39	tamgc	or take the cover off, and swap the compact flash heh
2014-07-10 22:14:55	askore	yeah thats whay we did
2014-07-10 22:15:06	askore	it didnt have one at all when I got it
2014-07-10 22:15:07	tamgc	it should, that's how you get IOS on nuked systems
2014-07-10 22:16:08	askore	mmk
2014-07-10 22:16:20	tamgc	oh general word of caution...seems like the ASAs' RAM tends to be sensitive to power events...we've had a couple die because of power outage before
2014-07-10 22:16:28	askore	hrm
2014-07-10 22:16:33	askore	okie
2014-07-10 22:16:51	askore	I still dont have a clear definition of what I'm doing with the asa's but
2014-07-10 22:17:14	tamgc	it's fun when they're a SPOF in some random part of infrastructure heh...but luckily it's not too difficult to swap the RAM or CF
2014-07-10 22:17:20	askore	until I get that "learn how to do the stuff" is good
2014-07-10 22:17:24	tamgc	firewall *ALL* the things
2014-07-10 22:17:24	askore	heh
2014-07-10 22:17:29	askore	yep
2014-07-10 22:17:31	askore	well
2014-07-10 22:17:51	askore	it's to do with a software upgrade
2014-07-10 22:19:54	tamgc	hm? like poking holes in FW for things?
2014-07-10 22:20:40	tamgc	or maybe usign the asa as a vpn tunnel?
2014-07-10 22:25:28	askore	i think vpn tunnel
2014-07-10 22:28:17	tamgc	ah... so that could be potentially annoying depending on cisco resources they have (licensing and such...) but I generally don't deal with that...just remember having to work something out for Pittock
2014-07-10 22:30:32	askore	oh wait no it was something to do with anyconnect
2014-07-10 22:30:51	askore	mmmrrr idk this is a learning assignment
2014-07-10 22:31:08	askore	but cisco resources probably not a problem
2014-07-10 22:31:24	askore	since they have a weekly meeting with meraki developers
2014-07-10 22:31:39	askore	(kinda unrelated but kinda not)
2014-07-10 22:38:51	tamgc	yeah anyconnect's the cisco vpn client
2014-07-10 22:39:21	askore	mmk, so that
2014-07-10 22:39:38	tamgc	not sure if you have a cisco.com login, but if you sign up for one and they add you to the contract number, that should open up some useful docs to you
2014-07-10 22:40:02	askore	yup thats all done
2014-07-10 22:40:10	askore	although idk where the docs are hiding
2014-07-10 22:41:22	tamgc	for the MtG folks: http://shittymagicalters.tumblr.com/
2014-07-10 22:44:10	tamgc	yeah, it takes a bit to get used to...
2014-07-10 22:44:17	askore	http://derpycats.com/image/91425414981 this is askore now
2014-07-10 22:45:04	tamgc	but basically after logging in click "Support" and type in whatever you're trying to get docs for (in this case "Cisco ASA", and it'll expand that for you)
2014-07-10 22:45:42	 *	tamgc has no idea how to read that cats expression -.-
2014-07-10 22:48:18	tamgc	http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa92/configuration/vpn/asa-vpn-cli.html
2014-07-10 23:40:54	@bajr	rawr!
2014-07-10 23:44:01	tamgc	rawr!
2014-07-10 23:44:17	tamgc	ra-zZzz....
2014-07-10 23:51:53	@bajr	oh yeah, you guys are an hour ahead of me
2014-07-11 02:16:49	relsqui	vroom
2014-07-11 07:12:45	tamgc	wait wha? 4 hrs?
2014-07-11 07:12:54	tamgc	you're on the russia end of alaska?
2014-07-11 07:14:08	askore	tamgc: he said an hour
2014-07-11 07:14:29	tamgc	...
2014-07-11 07:14:36	tamgc	yep... >.> <.<
2014-07-11 07:14:54	tamgc	words pshaw >.>
2014-07-11 08:17:52	askore	that moment when you see a [citation needed] on wikipedia and think, I could probably find a citation for that.
2014-07-11 08:19:11	 *	askore gets back on topic and stops depth-first traversing wikipedia
2014-07-11 08:21:10	tamgc	still needed until you find the citation =)
2014-07-11 08:21:28	askore	yup
2014-07-11 08:36:17	 *	askore grumbles at windows--
2014-07-11 08:36:30	askore	I just want to dd if=iso of=usb
2014-07-11 08:36:32	askore	but this is windows
2014-07-11 08:36:37	askore	so I have to jump through hoops
2014-07-11 08:37:31	 *	tamgc lights hoop on fire...cracks whip
2014-07-11 08:37:57	 *	askore hops and tries not to get burned
2014-07-11 08:38:55	tamgc	http://www.isotousb.com/ looks promising...
2014-07-11 08:40:11	askore	grr
2014-07-11 08:40:30	askore	a lot of things are blocked on the internal wifi - that is one of them
2014-07-11 08:41:18	tamgc	tunnel *all* the things >.>
2014-07-11 08:41:44	askore	I don't really know how to do that in windows
2014-07-11 08:42:09	tamgc	(yeah...that's a pretty sucky combo...and there might even be perms issue with windows depending on how locked down their stuff is)
2014-07-11 08:42:17	askore	grrr
2014-07-11 08:42:54	tamgc	how's that USB linux boot drive idea coming?  or is this it? heh
2014-07-11 08:43:09	askore	this is it yeah
2014-07-11 08:43:27	 *	askore plans to put files in ~askore/public_html
2014-07-11 08:44:47	askore	fffff
2014-07-11 08:44:47	tamgc	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ maybe?
2014-07-11 08:45:06	askore	denied again
2014-07-11 08:45:28	 *	askore asks coworker running fedora to pls halp
2014-07-11 08:46:24	askore	oh
2014-07-11 08:46:32	askore	.....
2014-07-11 08:46:34	askore	well that's derp
2014-07-11 08:46:54	askore	lol
2014-07-11 08:47:03	askore	all I have to do is rename the files to not have .zip or .iso or whatever on the end
2014-07-11 08:47:13	askore	or .exe
2014-07-11 08:48:51	tamgc	o.O
2014-07-11 08:48:57	tamgc	oh
2014-07-11 08:49:03	tamgc	filter based on extension?
2014-07-11 08:49:53	askore	yeah
2014-07-11 08:49:55	askore	lol
2014-07-11 08:50:22	askore	which means I still can't download straight from websites but if they let me wget, I can wget to my homedir and then http get with firefox from there
2014-07-11 08:50:43	askore	although now it's really slow >.>
2014-07-11 08:54:26	tamgc	just walk over to campus and pull it from here instead =P
2014-07-11 08:54:38	askore	heh
2014-07-11 09:07:00	-->	mobilecat (andywood@stargate.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #tabletop
2014-07-11 09:09:42	<--	mobilecat (andywood@stargate.cat.pdx.edu) has quit (Client Quit)
2014-07-11 10:03:01	askore	aw crap
2014-07-11 10:03:09	askore	ubuntu----------
2014-07-11 10:03:18	askore	installed grub on the wrong device
2014-07-11 10:04:41	tamgc	o.O
2014-07-11 10:04:52	tamgc	guess you'll just have to make the laptop ubuntu now?
2014-07-11 10:04:55	tamgc	>.> <.<
2014-07-11 10:05:37	askore	heh
2014-07-11 10:05:46	askore	will probably have to get it reimaged if that happened
2014-07-11 10:06:04	tamgc	do they even care? and do you actually need winders?
2014-07-11 10:07:07	askore	well a little, naybe
2014-07-11 10:07:09	askore	maybe
2014-07-11 10:07:15	askore	and they do care
2014-07-11 10:07:44	tamgc	ah sucks
2014-07-11 10:07:56	askore	hrm
2014-07-11 10:07:57	tamgc	(some places just care about it being returned in certain state)
2014-07-11 10:08:07	tamgc	although that could be done with a reimage
2014-07-11 10:08:12	askore	yeah
2014-07-11 10:08:17	askore	I dunno if I can do that
2014-07-11 10:08:26	askore	I might have to send it to IT to reimage it
2014-07-11 10:08:45	askore	how do I tell where grub is installed?
2014-07-11 10:08:46	tamgc	make friends with the IT folks =)
2014-07-11 10:09:00	askore	I guess so :P
2014-07-11 10:09:09	mancat	askore: i think you can check /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2014-07-11 10:09:28	askore	mancat: theres a lot of stuff in that file, what am I looking for?
2014-07-11 10:10:25	tamgc	(that was meant as a "pro-tip" =P you can probably get away with a lot more things if you're on good terms)
2014-07-11 10:10:41	askore	probably
2014-07-11 10:10:53	askore	ideally I would like to fix it myself first
2014-07-11 10:11:19	tamgc	yeah, they might even be like "oh sure, nuke it, it'll be fine"
2014-07-11 10:11:19	mancat	askore: look for the boot menu records, /menuentry
2014-07-11 10:12:05	mancat	it's like an 8-10 line chunk, indented. somewhere in there will be grub-style block dev ids for the boot device
2014-07-11 10:12:18	askore	ok,
2014-07-11 10:12:45	tamgc	should be like "root (hdx,y)"
2014-07-11 10:13:07	askore	hd1?
2014-07-11 10:13:10	mancat	yeah
2014-07-11 10:13:13	askore	sda?
2014-07-11 10:13:15	mancat	that'll be second drive
2014-07-11 10:13:18	askore	ah
2014-07-11 10:13:19	mancat	hdb
2014-07-11 10:13:31	mancat	er. sdb
2014-07-11 10:13:35	askore	thats.... good but not the behavior I'm seeinf
2014-07-11 10:13:47	mancat	grub1 or grub2?
2014-07-11 10:14:08	askore	pro ably grub2?
2014-07-11 10:14:23	mancat	do you have a grub.conf in the same directory?
2014-07-11 10:14:32	askore	no
2014-07-11 10:14:35	mancat	grub2
2014-07-11 10:14:39	askore	ok
2014-07-11 10:14:53	mancat	you can probably man the file
2014-07-11 10:15:08	mancat	i'm pretty sure it's automatically generated when you do update-grub2
2014-07-11 10:15:33	mancat	so i imagine it should be accurate
2014-07-11 10:15:43	mancat	but i might be barking up the wrong tree
2014-07-11 10:15:50	askore	uhhhh
2014-07-11 10:17:05	mancat	from royal: set root='hd0,msdos1'
2014-07-11 10:17:18	askore	I think it should be hd1
2014-07-11 10:17:23	askore	if hd1 is sdb
2014-07-11 10:17:32	askore	but its acting like its hd0
2014-07-11 10:17:45	mancat	and you updated grub recently?
2014-07-11 10:17:50	tamgc	yeah, hd1 is sdb
2014-07-11 10:17:52	askore	and if it is then I overwrote part of sda and my windoes partition is fucked
2014-07-11 10:18:02	askore	I literally just installed ubuntu
2014-07-11 10:18:19	tamgc	well maybe
2014-07-11 10:18:36	tamgc	check bios to see if it's set to boot from usb first?
2014-07-11 10:18:46	mancat	you actually wrote to sda, you didn't just clobber the partition map?
2014-07-11 10:18:52	askore	if I unplug sdb I get grub recovery
2014-07-11 10:19:02	askore	I dont know im asking you that
2014-07-11 10:19:05	tamgc	if so it's prob seeing the bootloader on the hd1, and going "oh ok, boot"
2014-07-11 10:19:15	askore	it didnt ask me where to install grub
2014-07-11 10:19:20	askore	if I unplug sdb I get grub recovery
2014-07-11 10:19:30	tamgc	hm
2014-07-11 10:20:02	tamgc	any references to hd0 in the grub conf?
2014-07-11 10:20:05	askore	no
2014-07-11 10:20:08	tamgc	or sda?
2014-07-11 10:20:26	askore	nope
2014-07-11 10:20:36	askore	and sda just has sda1 
2014-07-11 10:20:46	askore	which is correct
2014-07-11 10:20:46	mancat	what's on that partition?
2014-07-11 10:20:50	askore	uh
2014-07-11 10:20:57	askore	its encrypted so I cant exactly
2014-07-11 10:21:06	askore	presumably windoes
2014-07-11 10:21:06	mancat	do you know what's upposed to eb on it?
2014-07-11 10:21:10	mancat	ok
2014-07-11 10:21:37	askore	brb
2014-07-11 10:21:57	 *	mancat not actually sure what's needful in recovering bootability on an encrypted partition
2014-07-11 10:22:14	mancat	i feel like it's probably not much harder than a non-crypted partition, which is pretty doable
2014-07-11 10:22:33	mancat	i don't think grub holds the keys to the crypto
2014-07-11 10:25:20	askore	yeah
2014-07-11 10:25:35	tamgc	sounds like grub stomped over the MBR
2014-07-11 10:25:35	askore	I wanted grub installed on sdb with no knowledge of sda
2014-07-11 10:25:37	askore	yup
2014-07-11 10:25:48	askore	and since its encrypted that may or may nlt be recoverae
2014-07-11 10:25:51	askore	er
2014-07-11 10:25:53	askore	recoverable
2014-07-11 10:26:35	mancat	xoraxiom knows disk crypto and booting pretty well, he may be able to help
2014-07-11 10:27:00	askore	its probably easier to reimage sda and take it out before installing on sdb
2014-07-11 10:27:14	mancat	i'm pretty good with fdisk and poartition recovery and stuff, but disk crypto is beyond my expertise
2014-07-11 10:27:33	tamgc	I guess it depends on if it nuked keys when it stomped on things or if it's repairable so that it bootstraps enough to boot to the encrypted portion
2014-07-11 10:27:56	askore	like I said all of this is harder than reimaging.
2014-07-11 10:29:27	mancat	trufax
2014-07-11 10:29:57	stacybird	maybe you just overwrite the laptop with ubuntu and use a windows vm for outlook?  :D
2014-07-11 10:30:00	stacybird	:P
2014-07-11 10:30:03	askore	heh
2014-07-11 10:30:10	askore	outlook not the problem
2014-07-11 10:30:29	tamgc	askore: pshaw, reimaging isn't nerd-snipey enough
2014-07-11 10:30:53	askore	tamgc: being nerdsniped at work isnt useful. also I would still have to go talk to the IT guys.
2014-07-11 10:30:56	 *	tamgc actually kind of curious if it's recoverable without nuke from orbit
2014-07-11 10:30:59	stacybird	on a more practical note:  if it was just grub, and the chunk overwrittedn was small enough, you could ask the help desk folks if they have the first x bytes that got overwritten.
2014-07-11 10:31:27	askore	they dont do full system images, just specific file locatuons kn backups
2014-07-11 10:31:31	askore	ugh phone typing bad
2014-07-11 10:31:48	stacybird	since I'm assuming possibly incorrectly that the first thing it does before decrypting is load some stuff about decrypting
2014-07-11 10:31:54	stacybird	ah
2014-07-11 10:31:58	askore	yeah
2014-07-11 10:32:08	stacybird	and grub is small 
2014-07-11 10:32:30	 *	askore will ask garrett when he gets back
2014-07-11 10:32:40	stacybird	kk
2014-07-11 10:32:41	mancat	stacybird: it may have a chainloader thing in a cleartext section at the beginning of the partition with the crypto algorithm in it
2014-07-11 10:32:45	stacybird	askore++
2014-07-11 10:33:08	mancat	in which case if it's password crypted it's recoverable
2014-07-11 10:33:09	stacybird	mancat: yeah, but I don't know what we're using.  also... I got a mac not windoz
2014-07-11 10:33:25	mancat	my guess is "is it crypted with a password or a key" is probably the important part of the question
2014-07-11 10:33:27	askore	mancat: this thing is sufficiently complex that it connects to AD
2014-07-11 10:33:39	mancat	askore: that actually might be good news
2014-07-11 10:33:54	mancat	in the hypothetical eventuality where you're trying to recover it
2014-07-11 10:34:17	mancat	AD means things are still stored somewhere, which probably includes key or pass
2014-07-11 10:34:21	mancat	the rest is just software
2014-07-11 10:35:10	askore	password at least
2014-07-11 10:35:12	askore	hmmm
2014-07-11 10:35:27	askore	so I'm wondering about how easy it is to nerdsnipe the it people here
2014-07-11 10:35:36	askore	if its easy they might take restoring it as a challenge
2014-07-11 10:35:48	tamgc	only one way to find out =)
2014-07-11 10:36:04	askore	yeah, have enough social gumption to go ask
2014-07-11 10:36:09	askore	>.>
2014-07-11 10:36:27	tamgc	you're going to have to ask them to re-image anyways, right?
2014-07-11 10:36:31	askore	tru
2014-07-11 10:36:36	tamgc	so might as well pre-face with what happened
2014-07-11 10:36:49	askore	mmmmmmm
2014-07-11 10:37:01	tamgc	chat a bit, build rapport...maybe (depending on how BOFHy they are)
2014-07-11 10:37:05	 *	stacybird goes to look up nerdsniping
2014-07-11 10:37:07	askore	heh
2014-07-11 10:37:24	 *	tamgc waits for stacybird to get nerdsniped on nerdsniping
2014-07-11 10:37:47	tamgc	at the very least, you can figure out if they're people to avoid heh
2014-07-11 10:37:55	askore	lol
2014-07-11 10:37:56	stacybird	heh
2014-07-11 10:38:11	 *	stacybird is educated.
2014-07-11 10:38:11	askore	on one hand I'd rather not get in trouvle
2014-07-11 10:38:13	stacybird	:P
2014-07-11 10:38:23	askore	but who are they gonna tell? the manager who GAVE me the hdd?
2014-07-11 10:38:29	tamgc	yeah...
2014-07-11 10:38:34	tamgc	and you're an intern
2014-07-11 10:38:38	tamgc	you didn't know better >.> <.<
2014-07-11 10:38:44	askore	heh
2014-07-11 10:38:48	askore	I was led astray
2014-07-11 10:40:26	tamgc	just blame nibz
2014-07-11 10:40:35	askore	haha
2014-07-11 10:40:38	tamgc	(can say that now, since he's in here =P)
2014-07-11 10:40:41	askore	"this guy at hp told me to"
2014-07-11 10:41:02	tamgc	"this guy at HP said it was the normal thing to do" heh
2014-07-11 10:41:02	askore	"he also told me to ceph my and stacybird's homedirs"

2014-07-11 11:32:21	tamgc	seems like a legitimate question -.-
2014-07-11 11:32:32	relsqui	oh, it is
2014-07-11 11:32:45	relsqui	but it is (apparently) a tumblr for jokes (I don't follow it, someone I know linked it)
2014-07-11 11:32:52	relsqui	therefore, joke answer
2014-07-11 11:33:02	tamgc	ah
2014-07-11 11:33:05	dom	i dont get the joke
2014-07-11 11:33:25	tamgc	me neither, other than stalagmite/tite reference I'm guessing...
2014-07-11 11:33:43	dom	that was my guess too, but it didn't seem very solid
2014-07-11 11:33:54	relsqui	yeah, that's it
2014-07-11 11:34:34	tamgc	also, as an outsider, could be potentially off-putting for people genuinely curious -.-
2014-07-11 11:34:38	dom	i guess other people laugh
2014-07-11 11:34:45	 *	dom -> fab
2014-07-11 11:35:27	relsqui	tamgc: if it were in an educational space/context, yeah, I'd have a problem with that. it's not making fun of the asker, though, it's just literally a space for being silly
2014-07-11 11:35:31	relsqui	so people are being silly in it
2014-07-11 11:35:39	relsqui	and there get to be those too
2014-07-11 11:37:26	tamgc	ah true
2014-07-11 12:53:57	askore	well the laptop has been submitted to IT
2014-07-11 12:54:20	askore	(we wiped out grub and said "we don't know what happened, it just won't boot!")
2014-07-11 12:54:32	askore	(because apparently they are not interested in being nerdsniped)
2014-07-11 12:54:42	askore	so I'm back on my own laptop now
2014-07-11 12:56:47	tamgc	ah not sure if that's a good or bad sign of their IT.. -.-
2014-07-11 12:57:55	askore	I mean they're doing their job
2014-07-11 12:57:59	askore	can't fault that
2014-07-11 12:58:09	tamgc	yeah
2014-07-11 12:58:15	askore	but also it's IT at a super big tech firm, they don't have much wiggle room
2014-07-11 12:58:26	tamgc	maybe
2014-07-11 12:58:30	askore	yes, maybe.
2014-07-11 12:58:43	askore	but "operating system not found" is easier to explain than "grub_recovery"
2014-07-11 12:58:44	tamgc	I mean, they could always UTi it... heh
2014-07-11 12:58:48	askore	:P

2014-07-11 13:53:36	askore	so that'll be done... whenever
2014-07-11 13:53:48	stacybird	what happens when you see dave walk by with a cisco box?  you follow him running of course!
2014-07-11 13:53:52	askore	yesss

2014-07-13 14:05:03	relsqui	lol
2014-07-13 14:05:08	relsqui	huh, I like this http://m.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/two-couples-one-mortgage/374102/
2014-07-13 14:05:23	relsqui	I've had conversations about that kind of arrangement with a lot of my friends
2014-07-13 14:05:38	relsqui	a little different because most of my friends don't want kids, but same basic principle
2014-07-13 14:06:23	askore	huh
2014-07-13 14:06:30	askore	that's a pretty cool idea
2014-07-13 14:06:35	relsqui	innit?
2014-07-13 14:07:31	tamgc	bajr: aww, you needed to grow out your beard more to blend in
2014-07-13 14:08:19	dom	I mean the idea of one family = one house is not that old
2014-07-13 14:10:27	relsqui	yeah
2014-07-13 14:10:38	relsqui	especially one nuclear family (just parents and kids)
2014-07-13 14:10:48	relsqui	which is mentioned in the article briefly
2014-07-13 14:11:03	dom	yah
2014-07-13 14:11:18	dom	well one *family* = one house is pretty old
2014-07-13 14:11:23	relsqui	right
2014-07-13 14:11:30	dom	but like family like everyone related by blood but like 6 generations
2014-07-13 14:11:37	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-13 14:11:48	@bajr	well, hopefully now i'll have time to finish campaign
2014-07-13 14:11:49	relsqui	something something takes a village
2014-07-13 14:11:57	dom	something something lonely
2014-07-13 14:12:08	tamgc	eh yeah, but there's also different concepts of family
2014-07-13 14:12:17	tamgc	and poly arrangements
2014-07-13 14:12:27	dom	yeah, I think the concept mentioned in the article is more about just increasing family size
2014-07-13 14:12:35	dom	its like living with your grown siblings
2014-07-13 14:12:39	relsqui	family size and criteria, yeah
2014-07-13 14:12:44	relsqui	it's doing that thing but with chosen family
2014-07-13 14:12:55	relsqui	tamgc: right, that's the point
2014-07-13 14:13:10	relsqui	not poly in this case but making their own big family
2014-07-13 14:13:47	tamgc	I kind of read it as a poly-relationship (albeit I tend to have a broader spectrum that I categorize in that)
2014-07-13 14:13:55	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-13 14:14:07	tamgc	and relationship doesn't have to mean romantic
2014-07-13 14:14:16	relsqui	I'd hesitate to use the term for this because I think it'd be misleading for most people, but I do see what you mean
2014-07-13 14:14:24	tamgc	but I'm sure there's a solid enough bond between them that they're leaning towards that
2014-07-13 14:14:25	relsqui	I mean, if you apply "poly" to nonromantic relationships, most of us are :P
2014-07-13 14:15:06	tamgc	well, yes and no, my boundary for that would mainly be the strength of the bond
2014-07-13 14:15:20	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-13 14:15:28	tamgc	and tbh, I don't think most bonds people create are actually that strong
2014-07-13 14:15:33	relsqui	heh
2014-07-13 14:15:49	tamgc	but yes, most of us would be poly in some manner
2014-07-13 14:15:53	relsqui	true enough. I have trouble with the shallow ones so I think a greater proportion for me personally are strong ones
2014-07-13 14:16:11	relsqui	(but then a smaller number overall that are meaningful)
2014-07-13 14:16:18	relsqui	that's actually less true recently than it has been historically
2014-07-13 14:16:46	relsqui	because CAT/tutoring/being a FAB regular in general has put me in frequent friendly contact with a lot of people
2014-07-13 14:16:53	tamgc	yeah
2014-07-13 14:17:04	relsqui	there's still only a few that I go out of my way to see
2014-07-13 14:17:51	tamgc	it's a weird categorization for me...but I've always felt like most "friends" are actually "acquaintances" for a lot of people with a small subset of that as actual friends
2014-07-13 14:17:59	tamgc	exactly
2014-07-13 14:18:32	relsqui	yeah
2014-07-13 14:19:54	nebrith	tamgc: yes...
2014-07-13 14:21:09	relsqui	haha. mentioned how old I was in another channel and my friend dan is like "omg I've known you forever"
2014-07-13 14:22:07	relsqui	goes both ways, it's still a little odd that he's >40
2014-07-13 14:24:05	tamgc	*gasp* =P
2014-07-13 14:24:19	relsqui	because I met him when he was in his mid-30s :)
2014-07-13 14:24:33	relsqui	and easily passing for 25
2014-07-13 14:25:02	tamgc	hah *inserts asian joke* =P
2014-07-13 14:25:06	relsqui	lol
2014-07-13 14:25:20	tamgc	but yeah...there's always mental, physical, chronological age...
2014-07-13 14:25:24	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-13 14:25:39	relsqui	yeah, we've always been a good social fit, which is why we're so close even though there's a pretty big gap
2014-07-13 14:25:45	tamgc	if people are awesome, they're awesome, doesn't matter how old they are heh
2014-07-13 14:25:47	askore	YES!
2014-07-13 14:25:55	relsqui	he also did eventually start looking his age, went all gray on top
2014-07-13 14:25:56	relsqui	and on face
2014-07-13 14:25:59	relsqui	because beardy
2014-07-13 14:26:52	tamgc	yeah...gray hair doesn't mean much to me...I've had some gray since middle school -.-
2014-07-13 14:27:09	relsqui	yeah, I definitely have friends younger than him who have some
2014-07-13 14:27:29	tamgc	one of my friends was like "Wait...is that a gray hair?" and I thought he was fucking with me -.- heh
2014-07-13 14:27:42	relsqui	haha
2014-07-13 14:27:56	relsqui	I have a couple of hairs that I can't tell if they are still bleached or just pale on their own *g*
2014-07-13 14:28:43	tamgc	had college-age friends when I was a kid and have had kids as friends post-grad...just a matter of common interests and not being assholes -.-
2014-07-13 14:29:06	relsqui	yep
2014-07-13 14:29:22	relsqui	the age range of people I'd consider my friends and talk to regularly is ... ~22-42
2014-07-13 14:29:28	nebrith	tamgc: yeah, my best friends in high school were collect students. It didn't make me as mature as I thought I was ;)
2014-07-13 14:29:33	relsqui	lol
2014-07-13 14:29:36	relsqui	yeahhh
2014-07-13 14:29:48	relsqui	actually I don't remember how mature I thought I was in high school
2014-07-13 14:29:56	relsqui	I was an appropriate amount of immature and also pretty down on myself
2014-07-13 14:30:01	askore	heh
2014-07-13 14:30:12	askore	I certainly took myself very seriously in high school, whether I thought I was mature or not
2014-07-13 14:30:18	relsqui	oh, yes
2014-07-13 14:30:23	tamgc	heh...I meant like elementary school as a kid...just video games/basketball/hanging out
2014-07-13 14:30:23	relsqui	definitely took myself unnecessarily seriously
2014-07-13 14:31:45	tamgc	but yeah, HS...took life too seriously, ended up giving 0 fucks -.-
2014-07-13 14:32:54	 *	relsqui looks at calendar
2014-07-13 14:33:00	relsqui	I am feeling less swamped than I have been recently
2014-07-13 14:33:07	tamgc	\o/
2014-07-13 14:34:03	relsqui	yes :)
2014-07-13 14:34:13	relsqui	helps that I got ahead on building orientation packets over the weekend
2014-07-13 14:34:21	relsqui	zaalatta++ made me a pile of them and then I made an additional pile
2014-07-13 14:34:47	relsqui	so I think I'm good on those for, like, three weeks
2014-07-13 14:34:48	tamgc	zaalatta++
2014-07-13 14:34:51	 *	relsqui makes a note on calendar after that to make more
2014-07-13 14:34:53	tamgc	relsqui++
2014-07-13 14:35:13	relsqui	huh
2014-07-13 14:35:25	tamgc	hm?
2014-07-13 14:35:39	relsqui	if I printed and stapled them in advance I could probably do the folding and paperclipping parts in braindump
2014-07-13 14:35:51	relsqui	not loud enough to be disruptive and gives me something to do with my hands that doesn't require brain
2014-07-13 14:50:02	nebrith	relsqui: I did that a lot. Sorting paper is soothing
2014-07-13 14:50:25	nebrith	college*
2014-07-13 14:50:38	relsqui	hehe, yes
2014-07-13 14:51:03	relsqui	I got the orientation leaders to help me with it a couple weeks ago but they were kinda sloppy >_> it made me appreciate the ones you made more, haha
2014-07-13 14:51:06	relsqui	you/zaalatta
2014-07-13 14:51:18	relsqui	and that's part of why I did a bunch myself. if you want something done right ... *g*
2014-07-13 14:51:31	tamgc	does the CAT still have access to trifolds?
2014-07-13 14:51:36	nebrith	I think the best thing I've learned so far in life is let yourself be earnest, but don't take yourself too seriously
2014-07-13 14:51:43	nebrith	tamgc: yup! We update it periodically
2014-07-13 14:51:44	tamgc	trifolders*
2014-07-13 14:51:57	relsqui	do you mean the trifold brochure or a machine to fold it neatly
2014-07-13 14:52:01	tamgc	it was some gadget that did the folding for you...
2014-07-13 14:52:03	tamgc	yeah
2014-07-13 14:52:06	tamgc	the machine
2014-07-13 14:52:11	relsqui	¯\(°_o)/¯
2014-07-13 14:52:17	relsqui	no idea. I did 'em by hand :P
2014-07-13 14:52:58	tamgc	apparently that thing is kind of useful to have...=P
2014-07-13 14:53:16	relsqui	I can imagine
2014-07-13 14:53:23	relsqui	so are printers that staple stuff for you *g*
2014-07-13 14:54:34	tamgc	heh yep
2014-07-13 14:54:40	tamgc	or minions to do it for you >.> <.<
2014-07-13 14:55:09	relsqui	right, just need *competent* minions :)
2014-07-13 14:55:33	relsqui	and frankly I have enough trouble getting people to volunteer for orientations without making them do grunt work also :P

2014-07-13 15:41:23	relsqui	XD

2014-07-13 15:41:44	relsqui	it's not, like, Real Food but it's enough to bootstrap energy levels so I can move on with my day
2014-07-13 15:42:26	relsqui	also it's fucking delicious, I love these things
2014-07-13 15:43:09	jesusaurus	especially with either peanut butter or a soft cheese
2014-07-13 15:43:25	relsqui	well, these are cheddary already
2014-07-13 15:43:34	relsqui	dunno why this company ruins all their simple tasty things by putting flavor stuff on 'em
2014-07-13 15:43:37	relsqui	but eh
2014-07-13 15:43:47	relsqui	they're here and they were a present, so no complaints :)
2014-07-13 15:45:36	relsqui	(most egregious offender: kale chips. I can't eat too many of their kale chips at a time because it's too ... rich? and that's a sign of doing kale chips incorrectly)
2014-07-13 15:46:19	 *	mancat has yet to accept kale chips ms a snack food
2014-07-13 15:46:31	relsqui	more for me

2014-07-13 15:50:45	mancat	so sad!
2014-07-13 15:50:53	mancat	the saddest day!

2014-07-13 15:53:06	 *	relsqui >_>
2014-07-13 15:56:05	relsqui	mancat: whenever I make pancakes, especially for just myself, I end up with a few of them just sitting in the pan covered until I get hungry again
2014-07-13 15:56:08	relsqui	and it just is pancake day
2014-07-13 15:56:37	relsqui	I do the same thing more or less with thai brunch in berkeley
2014-07-13 15:56:41	relsqui	because they give you so much food
2014-07-13 15:57:22	relsqui	so I'll eat like half of it and then bring the rest home (where home in this case is dan's place because he lives closest) and nibble on it later
2014-07-13 15:59:23	 *	mancat has a whole breakfast worth of pancakes sitting on his place, buttered and covered in apricot jam
2014-07-13 15:59:28	mancat	i guess that's lunch too
2014-07-13 15:59:35	 *	mancat pours a pint of tea

2014-07-13 15:59:59	relsqui	I was gonna say
2014-07-13 16:00:02	relsqui	it sounds like you're having a good day
2014-07-13 16:00:10	mancat	not too bad, really :D

2014-07-13 16:00:33	 *	mancat is full of ideas of all kinds
2014-07-13 16:00:38	 *	relsqui uses a sieve to separate these
2014-07-13 16:00:41	relsqui	seive?
2014-07-13 16:00:42	relsqui	sieve.
2014-07-13 16:01:03	mancat	good ideas, bad ideas, cold ideas, purple ideas, late ideas, colocated ideas, anti-ideas
2014-07-13 16:01:10	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-07-13 16:01:10	mancat	you name it, i've got an idea about it
2014-07-13 16:01:23	 *	relsqui eyes mancat suspiciously
2014-07-13 16:01:35	relsqui	what is your idea about ...
2014-07-13 16:01:39	mancat	lots of suspicious ideas
2014-07-13 16:01:42	 *	relsqui ponders
2014-07-13 16:01:43	mancat	that's one of my specialties
2014-07-13 16:01:46	relsqui	haha
2014-07-13 16:01:54	relsqui	mancat: <3
2014-07-13 16:02:31	relsqui	mancat: right now I'm enjoying knowing you well enough to have a pretty good sense of your tone
2014-07-13 16:02:34	relsqui	it is making this funnier
2014-07-13 16:06:10	askore	dangit cat, when I put MY hand over the edge of the desk, I'm doing human stuff not batting at you
2014-07-13 16:06:25	askore	and I do not enjoy being batted at and chewed on
2014-07-13 16:06:37	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-07-13 16:06:45	relsqui	cat <3
2014-07-13 16:06:52	askore	haha
2014-07-13 16:07:13	relsqui	do you need someone to come distract your cat by playing with it while you work
2014-07-13 16:07:28	relsqui	because while that sounds like a difficult and dangerous job I would be willing to make that sacrifice
2014-07-13 16:08:50	askore	haha
2014-07-13 16:09:00	askore	I may actually need such a human; it would make cleaning easier.
2014-07-13 16:09:48	relsqui	that would be, like, the best taskrabbit job ever
2014-07-13 16:09:51	relsqui	"come play with my cat"
2014-07-13 16:09:52	askore	haha
2014-07-13 16:09:54	askore	yeah!
2014-07-13 16:13:37	 *	askore requires new towels and more cooking tools and also cute leggings
2014-07-13 16:14:03	tamgc	relsqui: that sounds like a euphemism =P
2014-07-13 16:14:11	relsqui	:p
2014-07-13 16:14:24	tamgc	(an?)
2014-07-13 16:14:30	relsqui	(a)
2014-07-13 16:14:36	tamgc	relsqui++
2014-07-13 16:14:53	relsqui	I mean, it's arbitrary, but I'd say a
2014-07-13 16:15:10	askore	that e is like a consonant
2014-07-13 16:16:39	relsqui	yeah
2014-07-13 16:16:41	relsqui	it's a [j] sound
2014-07-13 16:16:47	relsqui	(one of the sounds y makes in english)
2014-07-13 16:17:42	askore	I wish more of the appliances had timers on them
2014-07-13 16:17:54	askore	(the dryer and the dishwasher)
2014-07-13 16:18:16	tamgc	you just need to: http://imgur.com/5KPlX so you kill 2 birds with one stone
2014-07-13 16:18:38	askore	oh god she'd hate that lol
2014-07-13 16:18:52	askore	barely puts up with having her tummy rubbed
2014-07-13 16:19:13	tamgc	that...sounds sad...
2014-07-13 16:19:25	tamgc	(also like a cat)
2014-07-13 16:19:32	askore	head and back scratches are preferred
2014-07-13 16:19:34	askore	also chest
2014-07-13 16:19:45	askore	but tummy is liable to earn you a bite
2014-07-13 16:19:47	askore	(not always)
2014-07-13 16:20:48	relsqui	that cat <3
2014-07-13 16:20:51	relsqui	cat mop
2014-07-13 16:20:54	askore	hehe
2014-07-13 16:20:58	 *	tamgc likes to tummy rub...probably because pets seem silliest when that's happening
2014-07-13 16:21:11	askore	hahaha no her silliest moment is back scratches
2014-07-13 16:21:18	askore	she licks uncontrollably'
2014-07-13 16:21:21	askore	it's so funny
2014-07-13 16:21:28	tamgc	o.O
2014-07-13 16:21:40	tamgc	like lick the air as you scratch her back?
2014-07-13 16:21:51	askore	yeah or her fur or your hand/face

2014-07-13 16:22:00	askore	much licks
2014-07-13 16:22:23	tamgc	set a spoon o' peanutbutter trap?
2014-07-13 16:22:34	tamgc	(actually not sure if that's good or bad for cats...)
2014-07-13 16:22:39	askore	no idea
2014-07-13 16:22:52	askore	haha kitty

2014-07-13 16:24:24	askore	of course there is
2014-07-13 16:24:32	askore	I know eggs are a go as long as they're cooked
2014-07-13 16:24:57	askore	and plants are generally no because SO many are poisonous
2014-07-13 16:24:58	tamgc	apparently not recommended
2014-07-13 16:25:00	tamgc	http://canigivemycat.com/peanut-butter
2014-07-13 16:26:30	relsqui	"for them food is just something they consume to get the energy they need to sleep all day" haha
2014-07-13 16:26:53	 *	askore checks status of cheese, since uhura stole a piece of cheese&cracker snack when I went to the bathroom
2014-07-13 16:27:14	relsqui	"can I give my cat applesauce?" shit, now I want applesauce
2014-07-13 16:27:17	askore	lol
2014-07-13 16:27:27	askore	homemade applesauce is the best
2014-07-13 16:27:47	tamgc	apparently "yesplz" is the answer for that particular CAT heh
2014-07-13 16:27:54	relsqui	haha

2014-07-13 16:29:13	askore	I don't understand that this site only has a previous button to take you to the next page
2014-07-13 16:29:19	relsqui	lol
2014-07-13 16:29:22	relsqui	yeah its navigation is weird
2014-07-13 16:29:26	relsqui	also it appears to disable all clicks?
2014-07-13 16:29:42	askore	I don't understand all the medications on this site
2014-07-13 16:29:50	askore	why are you trying to medicate your cat with anything the vet didn't give them
2014-07-13 16:30:37	relsqui	right?
2014-07-13 16:32:00	askore	hm computer making a bit of an odd noise...
2014-07-13 16:32:04	relsqui	man I'm kind of digging this thunder and no rain business
2014-07-13 16:32:16	relsqui	doesn't prevent me from going out and getting my shit done
2014-07-13 16:32:19	askore	relsqui: I'm digging it except it's scary and I'm worried about the power going out
2014-07-13 16:32:29	 *	askore isn't used to thunder storms >.<
2014-07-13 16:32:35	relsqui	huh, okay
2014-07-13 16:32:50	askore	I guess that mostly sums up to "not digging it" but...
2014-07-13 16:32:52	relsqui	anything particular you're concerned about wrt power loss?
2014-07-13 16:33:00	relsqui	or just in general
2014-07-13 16:33:06	askore	I don't have a surge protector
2014-07-13 16:33:12	relsqui	ahh
2014-07-13 16:33:14	askore	or, well
2014-07-13 16:33:16	tamgc	people tend to try to self-medicate even non-pets, so not surprised if people try to medicate their pets with human stuff
2014-07-13 16:33:25	askore	the power strip probably has something built in
2014-07-13 16:33:27	askore	but I don't know
2014-07-13 16:33:31	relsqui	do *any* of the medication ones say okay?
2014-07-13 16:33:47	askore	tamgc: no I mean using human medication on humans is normal
2014-07-13 16:33:58	askore	but saying "I have this human medication, I'll try it on a non-human" is really weird.
2014-07-13 16:34:21	askore	relsqui: not sure I didn't actually read any of them
2014-07-13 16:34:43	tamgc	yeah, but humans can be stupid (and self-medicate poorly) + anthromorphization of their pets = bad times
2014-07-13 16:35:16	relsqui	THOOOOOM
2014-07-13 16:35:30	askore	I tried to look for "energy drink" because I've heard that cats like the ones that have taurine
2014-07-13 16:35:34	askore	but it didn't have it
2014-07-13 16:35:39	tamgc	most power strips aren't surge protected if they don't indicate it
2014-07-13 16:36:52	askore	hm, ok
2014-07-13 16:37:05	tamgc	although chances of needing it tends to be pretty slim
2014-07-13 16:37:06	askore	so probably not surge protected
2014-07-13 16:37:11	askore	yeah probabyl
2014-07-13 16:40:14	relsqui	http://canigivemycat.com/tea

2014-07-13 16:41:23	askore	so most of the things I've looked up on this site so far have been
2014-07-13 16:41:35	askore	"It's not dangerous, but there's no good reason to"
2014-07-13 16:41:39	nebrith	heheh
2014-07-13 16:41:49	askore	to which I reply "if my cat wants to eat it and it's safe, that's a good reason to give it to her"
2014-07-13 16:41:55	jesusaurus	friend on the east coast just linked to https://i.imgur.com/eXHCtow.jpg

2014-07-13 16:53:58	askore	haha
2014-07-13 16:54:03	askore	what's winning right now?
2014-07-13 16:54:05	mancat	so far, "Oil of Oregano" is a prime candidate
2014-07-13 16:54:09	askore	heh
2014-07-13 16:54:40	mancat	"nutella" is a good second
2014-07-13 16:54:41	relsqui	hahahaha
2014-07-13 16:56:47	mancat	this site should come with a splash page that says "Look buddy. cats eat raw meat. Just about nothing else is very good for them. On top of that, humans eat one of the most exotic and generally toxic diets of all living creatures, not even accounting for commerical processing additives and practices. Herbs, nuts, alcohol, dairy, and garlic (some of our favorite things) are all toxic to most non-human species. It's a good bet that things you eat are no
2014-07-13 16:57:24	askore	"things you eat are no"?
2014-07-13 16:57:41	mancat	"not good for anything except (maybe) humans."
2014-07-13 16:57:41	jesusaurus	correct. things you eat are no

2014-07-13 16:58:19	 *	askore <3 weechat
2014-07-13 16:58:33	@bajr	I thought that wasn't unique to irssi
2014-07-13 16:58:38	jesusaurus	i thought irssi did the same thing as weechat -- splitting into multiple messages
2014-07-13 16:58:53	jesusaurus	bajr: yeah, its part of the irc protocol
2014-07-13 16:59:01	relsqui	there's a script for it

2014-07-13 17:07:54	tamgc	jesusaurus: part of the irc protocol to not handle line overflow well?
2014-07-13 17:08:12	askore	lol
2014-07-13 17:08:16	jesusaurus	tamgc: to just stop at N chars :P

2014-07-13 18:12:00	askore	my back hurts now
2014-07-13 18:12:02	askore	and the futon is still down
2014-07-13 18:12:24	askore	part of the problem is I only have a general idea of what exactly to do to make it go up
2014-07-13 18:12:29	askore	the other part is I have spaghetti arms.
2014-07-13 18:13:14	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-13 18:15:08	nebrith	askore: I have spaghetti arms and thick thighs. It's NOT FAIR
2014-07-13 18:15:11	nebrith	I am UNEVEN.
2014-07-13 18:15:37	tamgc	sturdy =P
2014-07-13 18:15:44	nebrith	but futons are tricky either way
2014-07-13 18:15:50	askore	phew ok we're good I got it
2014-07-13 18:15:56	tamgc	\o/
2014-07-13 18:16:08	askore	nebrith: honestly I'm really into that aesthetic, if I could have skinny arms that were also strong to a useful degree I would be fine
2014-07-13 18:16:21	nebrith	i keep trying to lose weight. It sucks. I only gain weight on my belly which has NO USE
2014-07-13 18:16:55	nebrith	right? being built like a Maya Kern character wouldn't bother me if I could put my hair up and not feel out of breath
2014-07-13 18:17:01	nebrith	but that might be asthma?
2014-07-13 18:17:25	askore	could be
2014-07-13 18:18:14	nebrith	I have no idea how ot adult. How do you go to a doctor when it's not SHAC? ¯\(°_o)/¯

2014-07-13 18:19:24	tamgc	nebrith: call doc's office, make appointment, explain why you're making appointment...
2014-07-13 18:19:41	tamgc	preferably the doc's office is one your insurance covers
2014-07-13 18:19:51	tamgc	comfy++
2014-07-13 18:20:13	tamgc	dm;cc? (doesn't matter; couch comfy?)
2014-07-13 18:20:45	tamgc	"canned vegetables"...I expect some accidents came out of that one...
2014-07-13 18:20:52	askore	lol
2014-07-13 18:21:07	askore	hopefully the veggies were taken out of the can
2014-07-13 18:21:07	tamgc	o.O bread defrost?
2014-07-13 18:21:10	askore	but you never know
2014-07-13 18:21:12	askore	tamgc: yeah
2014-07-13 18:21:18	askore	sometimes people put bread in the freezer
2014-07-13 18:21:33	tamgc	(fresh bread)++
2014-07-13 18:21:40	askore	my parents do that, because they buy it at costco and don't eat much bread
2014-07-13 18:21:42	tamgc	kind of wonder how well that keeps...
2014-07-13 18:21:46	askore	it doesn't taste much different
2014-07-13 18:21:51	tamgc	hmm interesting
2014-07-13 18:21:59	askore	like if it's still frozen obviously
2014-07-13 18:22:11	tamgc	just std sliced bread or other types too?
2014-07-13 18:22:16	askore	just sliced bread
2014-07-13 18:22:27	askore	well I guess the bread they buy has a plastic wrapper inside of the plastic bag
2014-07-13 18:22:40	askore	which would protect it better than just the bag
2014-07-13 18:22:46	tamgc	yeah...problem for me is the change in texture from freezing things usually...
2014-07-13 18:22:55	tamgc	ah
2014-07-13 18:23:01	askore	yeah but so little moisture can traverse those layers that it doesn't change
2014-07-13 18:23:06	tamgc	insulated frozen breads
2014-07-13 18:23:15	askore	and it's not full of water so the ice doesn't break stuff, like fruit
2014-07-13 18:23:20	askore	like happens with fruit
2014-07-13 18:25:52	tamgc	yar
2014-07-13 18:25:58	tamgc	I can see that
2014-07-13 18:26:11	tamgc	and I guess if you defrost while in the bag, moisture levels remain relatively the same
2014-07-13 18:32:33	relsqui	vi hart is still the best https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx5D09s5X6U
2014-07-13 18:34:52	tamgc	heh thought you were going to link to one of her microwave videos...
2014-07-13 18:35:36	relsqui	well everything she does is the best, so
2014-07-13 18:40:48	nebrith	tamgc: Wren hasn't died from freezing the multiple loaves he buys every week so I dunno
2014-07-13 18:40:51	nebrith	Seems good to me
2014-07-13 18:41:15	nebrith	tamgc: luckily I have UnitedHealthcare insurance and I think OHSU takes it so I won't feel super weird going.
2014-07-13 18:43:10	tamgc	nah, not so much afraid of death, more "it's doable, but would you"
2014-07-13 18:44:12	tamgc	\o/ insurance
2014-07-13 18:44:36	tamgc	also good to figure out what the insurance covers in general so you have some idea what you're good for
2014-07-13 18:44:47	tamgc	or other places if you need to change for $reasons
2014-07-13 18:46:16	tamgc	(like a coworker had a doc recommend amputation at one point...asked for a 2nd opinion, and she was like 'nope'...went to OHSU and they're like "yeah, we can not lop a chunk of you off"
2014-07-13 21:37:18	askore	ahh phew spicy ginger candies
2014-07-13 23:38:00	relsqui	ugh reading translations of Rilke makes me want to learn German
2014-07-13 23:39:28	relsqui	because I love it but I can *feel* that I'm missing part of it

2014-07-14 09:25:50	askore	nope I'm gonna make him take the MAX downtown
2014-07-14 09:26:07	askore	because he gets in at 4:30 and I'd like to work until 5
2014-07-14 09:26:54	tamgc	aha...(oh yeah...you 'work' now heh)
2014-07-14 09:26:57	askore	yup
2014-07-14 09:27:19	askore	and I figure he can handle "get on the only train possible and get off when the train says "Pioneer Square"

2014-07-14 09:27:32	tamgc	one would hope so heh

2014-07-14 09:33:25	askore	not sure if we'll eat downtown or drop off his luggage and then find food
2014-07-14 09:34:48	tamgc	guess it depends on how hungry he'd be heh

2014-07-14 11:45:59	nibalizer	askore: so its like worse
2014-07-14 11:46:11	nibalizer	because epel is community driven and people are lazy
2014-07-14 11:46:21	nibalizer	so a bunch of stuff in epel for centos 6 isn't in epel for centos 7 yet
2014-07-14 11:46:29	nibalizer	also i have a blog post on how to epel 7 so yea
2014-07-14 11:46:41	nibalizer	and no 32 bit stuff is just lolface
2014-07-14 11:46:42	askore	lol
2014-07-14 11:46:59	askore	eh my laptop isn't 32 bit so that's no big deal for me
2014-07-14 11:47:12	askore	but I'm just gonna put my arch laptop on top of my work laptop and do that for a while :P
2014-07-14 11:47:19	askore	hm I could do with at least one more usb port
2014-07-14 11:48:37	jesusaurus	it shouldnt be too hard to just download the spec files for the epel6 rpms and then build on centos7
2014-07-14 11:48:47	jesusaurus	does epel make the spec files available?
2014-07-14 11:48:58	askore	no idea
2014-07-14 11:51:17	nibalizer	jesusaurus: ya, plus since centos 7 is new its a golden opportunity to get a bunch of shit into epel that wasn't there before
2014-07-14 11:51:28	nibalizer	but i dont currently work with centos, so nofux?
2014-07-14 11:51:38	askore	heh

2014-07-14 11:52:10	jesusaurus	can just anyone upload to epel?
2014-07-14 11:52:33	jesusaurus	i was thinking it would be an easy way to crowd-source the build
2014-07-14 11:52:36	nibalizer	jesusaurus: no there is like a process
2014-07-14 11:52:51	jesusaurus	but then i realized that theres no gpg signing or anything so how do you trust it?

2014-07-14 21:09:30	@bajr	they were pretty far away

2014-07-15 09:26:25	@bajr	aka: orphans :D
2014-07-15 09:26:44	askore	bajr: no like tons of babies appearing on the unit screen and making the minimap crash the game
2014-07-15 09:26:50	@bajr	lol
2014-07-15 09:27:09	askore	"Stopped the babies of the world from appearing in the unit list (and associated minimap crash)"
2014-07-15 09:41:49	tamgc	*gasp* infantcide
2014-07-15 09:42:25	askore	I mean, sounds like the babies still exist elsewhere in the world, just not inside of your fortress.
2014-07-15 09:42:57	askore	no dwarven babies were harmed in the making of this patchset
2014-07-15 09:43:24	tamgc	pshaw, all state propaganda, y'all just left them in forests to fend for themselves
2014-07-15 09:43:36	tamgc	soon a roaming band of babies will come marauding through, you'll see
2014-07-15 09:43:40	askore	haha
2014-07-15 09:44:06	askore	there's also a bug where dwarves get a little scared and commit suicide (jumping off walls, into rivers, etc)
2014-07-15 09:44:14	tamgc	(actually would be kind of hilarius...)
2014-07-15 09:44:19	tamgc	o.O
2014-07-15 09:44:28	tamgc	being scared of the marauding babies no doubt
2014-07-15 09:44:28	askore	like, they disregard the rules of safe pathing
2014-07-15 09:44:37	askore	just absolutely lose it
2014-07-15 09:44:46	askore	it could be intentional but just a huge overreaction
2014-07-15 09:47:30	@bajr	kinda interested what the df source code looks like...
2014-07-15 09:47:43	askore	I think it's written in C, but that's about all I know
2014-07-15 09:48:09	 *	tamgc would reckon very similar to a MUD
2014-07-15 09:48:33	askore	hmm
2014-07-15 09:48:41	tamgc	speaking of which, http://eclipse.cs.pdx.edu/

2014-07-15 10:47:30	askore	if all he had to do was accept PRs
2014-07-15 10:47:35	Kraytul	he would still have 100% control.
2014-07-15 10:48:27	Kraytul	if he would just let us try to help...
2014-07-15 10:48:44	Kraytul	don't even have to accept things if he didn't want, but he could let us try.

2014-07-16 20:16:58	tamgc	job fair for ren faire jobs at ren faires...which would hopefully be fair jobs at the ren faire, since it could be fairly grueling depending on the job

2014-07-16 20:20:35	askore	bee products, like candles and honey
2014-07-16 20:20:59	tamgc	nightfly: nice...are there any local ones?
2014-07-16 20:21:30	tamgc	huh neat, are those like local bees?

2014-07-16 20:22:01	nightfly	I went to the one the The High Desert Celtic Society does, so not /quite/ local. I'm pretty sure there is a local one though

2014-07-16 20:25:13	tamgc	ah, still localish
2014-07-16 20:25:25	tamgc	and I'd expect it to be middle of nowhere somewhere...
2014-07-16 20:25:28	askore	yeah, apparently there's also a pretty big one closer to portland
2014-07-16 20:25:33	askore	around the same time
2014-07-16 20:25:39	askore	(it was the same weekend last year)

2014-07-16 20:34:55	askore	ah nice
2014-07-16 21:05:07	nightfly	Time to enjoy some chocolate chip flavored cookies :)
2014-07-16 21:09:21	askore	hahaha "Latest Version: 6.99991"
2014-07-16 21:10:06	askore	(it's a mod that the creator doesn't want to increment the major version number on until the game it's modding updates major versions, which is soon)
2014-07-16 21:11:35	tamgc	o.O what mod/game's that?
2014-07-16 21:11:47	askore	a UI mod for WoW
2014-07-16 21:12:56	tamgc	http://semver.org/
2014-07-16 21:13:09	tamgc	they need that ^ -.-
2014-07-16 21:13:47	askore	yeah it usually follows proper guidelines like that
2014-07-16 21:14:06	askore	(well just major and minor versions)
2014-07-16 21:14:23	askore	(kind of not really)
2014-07-16 21:14:26	askore	it's just a silly thing.
2014-07-16 21:14:44	askore	because WoW uses that kind of version scheme, and will go up a major version soon
2014-07-16 21:14:51	askore	so I guess the mod creator wants to do the same
2014-07-16 21:16:13	askore	I mean this is a mod that doesn't even check in with a server or whatever to see if it's out of date
2014-07-16 21:16:37	askore	when you join a group with someone using the same mod, the mods greet each other, and THEN you get a popup if you're out of date >.>
2014-07-16 21:19:08	tamgc	heh
2014-07-16 21:19:37	tamgc	(also, are mods allowed for WoW? =P)
2014-07-16 21:22:19	askore	yeah
2014-07-16 21:22:27	askore	there's really specific requirements
2014-07-16 21:22:44	tamgc	(actually, that's kind of a smart way to do update checks instead of all startups, maybe once a month + handshake...esp if the handshake happens for some reason already)
2014-07-16 21:23:59	askore	mm yep
2014-07-16 21:24:28	askore	I can't think of anything else that a handshake would happen for with that particular mod, but it's possible.
2014-07-16 21:26:27	tamgc	hm user data maybe?
2014-07-16 21:28:06	tamgc	(can see that being a potential work around to sync up data if it's used for something like that and there are restrictions on hitting the servers for that info)
2014-07-16 21:41:53	askore	ah, yeah possibly
2014-07-16 21:59:54	dom	the rules are like the game can't play the game better than you could with real skill
2014-07-16 22:00:08	dom	so it can't like draw lines on the battlefield for you to see where fire is
2014-07-16 22:00:33	dom	but it can manipulate any data a player could get legit
2014-07-16 22:11:56	tamgc	hm so yeah, I can see a redesigned HUD being useful for group situations
2014-07-16 22:13:08	tamgc	(not sure if XCOM -- or steam -- for pausing d/l randomly during an install -.- )
2014-07-16 22:13:26	tamgc	oh also, if anyone here wants XCOM: Enemy Unknown, let me know
2014-07-16 22:13:31	tamgc	(steam)
2014-07-16 22:30:08	dom	if you open a steam game, it pauses automatically
2014-07-16 22:30:18	dom	also if anyone wants XCOM: EU lemme know
2014-07-16 22:31:05	tamgc	dom: yeah...it was just the steam client running and I walked away
2014-07-16 22:31:52	tamgc	(tempting to repeat XCOM: EU line as a generic "over" sort of thing -.-)
2014-07-16 22:32:00	dom	hahahaha
2014-07-16 22:33:02	askore	tamgc: mostly the UI part is to make it prettier and easier to rearrange. There's other mods for more useful things.
2014-07-16 22:36:32	tamgc	ah interesting
2014-07-16 22:41:52	dom	for example: for a long time the only way to figure out raid member's hp was to click them or navigate through an ugly interface
2014-07-16 22:41:56	dom	someone made a mod for it
2014-07-16 22:42:08	dom	now its in base game, and theres lot of mods for alternatives
2014-07-16 22:42:49	askore	heh
2014-07-16 22:42:51	askore	yeah
2014-07-16 22:43:26	askore	for a while I used a healing add-on to heal by clicking on people's unit frames
2014-07-16 22:43:49	askore	but eventually elvUI let me do it with their unit frames, so I just used that instead >.>
2014-07-16 22:53:52	dom	hehe
2014-07-16 22:53:57	dom	I use vuhdo to heal
2014-07-16 22:54:02	dom	so I can use mouse scroll wheel
2014-07-16 23:18:28	askore	I think clique can make scroll wheel bindings? that work on elvui frames
2014-07-16 23:18:38	askore	although I've never tried
2014-07-16 23:19:03	askore	I just left/right/middle click with modifiers
2014-07-16 23:20:08	 *	askore doesnt like how vuhdo's frames look >.>
2014-07-16 23:21:40	dom	well, you can change that
2014-07-16 23:21:53	dom	scroll wheel bindings are notoriously not supported

2014-07-17 01:10:10	dom	bajr: no
2014-07-17 01:10:12	relsqui	he says to tell you he doesn't go to psu but is still playing minecraft with us in the lab
2014-07-17 01:10:15	relsqui	which is true
2014-07-17 01:10:18	relsqui	bajr: sure!
2014-07-17 01:10:20	@bajr	cool
2014-07-17 01:10:29	relsqui	bajr: hahaah ryland is like "wait that's not the nether" "no that's bajr's base'
2014-07-17 01:10:59	@bajr	lol
2014-07-17 01:11:28	@bajr	mmk, I think I have safely found a few good folk to pawn off some fish onto
2014-07-17 01:12:24	@bajr	i have a flight to catch in... 6 hours, time for sleep :)
2014-07-17 01:12:29	relsqui	bajr: how much freezer space should I anticipate needing
2014-07-17 01:12:32	relsqui	oh shit are you almost home? sweet!
2014-07-17 01:12:34	relsqui	bajr: when do we see you?
2014-07-17 01:12:47	dom	bajr: does that mean you can fix my card access
2014-07-17 01:12:57	@bajr	dom: your card access isn't broken
2014-07-17 01:13:05	relsqui	awww
2014-07-17 01:13:11	@bajr	I arrive in town around noon tomorrow. I'll grace the cat with my presence friday :)
2014-07-17 01:13:14	relsqui	sweet
2014-07-17 01:13:23	@bajr	(what's wrong with dom's access?)
2014-07-17 01:13:29	relsqui	so hiss meeting might actually be useful
2014-07-17 01:13:31	dom	bajr: I can't get through the cs lounge door
2014-07-17 01:13:34	relsqui	bajr: he can't get into the ... that
2014-07-17 01:13:34	dom	thats the only door
2014-07-17 01:13:38	dom	I can do all the other doors
2014-07-17 01:14:03	@bajr	cs lounge door... from the main hallway?
2014-07-17 01:14:06	dom	yes
2014-07-17 01:14:09	@bajr	huh
2014-07-17 01:14:11	dom	I can go through the locker hallway
2014-07-17 01:14:19	dom	which means I can still get into the lounge
2014-07-17 01:14:21	dom	strangely
2014-07-17 01:14:25	@bajr	if it works elsewhere, try again and make sure it's not trying to beep another card?
2014-07-17 01:14:35	dom	no, ive taken my card out totally
2014-07-17 01:14:38	dom	and tried
2014-07-17 01:14:41	dom	and still broken
2014-07-17 01:14:50	 *	bajr headscratch
2014-07-17 01:14:56	@bajr	poke me about it on friday
2014-07-17 01:15:00	dom	it might be that I never got my card activated for being a cs student, but cat access should still work
2014-07-17 01:15:04	dom	yeah I will
2014-07-17 01:15:10	relsqui	wait, *I* can check that
2014-07-17 01:15:12	 *	bajr nods sagely
2014-07-17 01:16:08	@bajr	relsqui: as for freezer space, about the size of two bags of frozen veggies
2014-07-17 01:16:33	relsqui	okay, that's doable
2014-07-17 01:16:46	relsqui	derp, I think I added him to dog dispatch instead of cs dispatch
2014-07-17 01:16:49	relsqui	... wait, I can *do* that?
2014-07-17 01:16:56	dom	wat
2014-07-17 01:24:19	relsqui	bajr: I still hope you are bringing me home a ptarmigan
2014-07-17 07:03:29	 *	tamgc thought bajr needed to hide a body for a while for a sec >.>
2014-07-17 09:13:42	 *	askore grumbles
2014-07-17 09:14:05	askore	the ongoing struggles of Askore and the "starting a VM is easy but running a DE on it is unusable"
2014-07-17 09:26:28	tamgc	DE?
2014-07-17 09:26:42	askore	desktop environment
2014-07-17 09:27:05	askore	using a tty at 800x600 resolution is much easier than running X at those dimensions
2014-07-17 09:29:07	tamgc	ah... young'uns -.-
2014-07-17 09:29:22	askore	:)
2014-07-17 09:29:23	tamgc	back in my day we had 640x480 and walked up hill both ways -.-
2014-07-17 09:29:39	tamgc	(also maybe a more minimalistic window manager?)
2014-07-17 09:29:44	askore	maybe
2014-07-17 09:30:11	askore	but it's just a huge pain
2014-07-17 09:30:54	tamgc	ayep
2014-07-17 09:31:13	askore	at least qemu is super easy to use. That takes a lot of the pain out of it.
2014-07-17 09:31:24	askore	and I think if I use spice the default resolution increases a little bit.
2014-07-17 09:31:33	askore	or at least... the window is floating so it doesn't get so deformed
2014-07-17 09:32:10	 *	askore should make a kickstart file >.>
2014-07-17 09:32:41	tamgc	set up xforwarding/vnc maybe? >.>
2014-07-17 09:32:49	askore	yeah that didn't help
2014-07-17 09:44:37	@bajr	hrrrng
2014-07-17 09:44:45	@bajr	I do not enjoy waking up at 3:30am
2014-07-17 09:57:29	askore	heh
2014-07-17 10:02:24	askore	oh wow
2014-07-17 10:02:28	askore	I made X crash haha
2014-07-17 10:02:36	askore	(I made X on my laptop crash)
2014-07-17 10:02:54	dom	bajr: your pain is real
2014-07-17 10:03:25	@bajr	dom: your mom is real
2014-07-17 10:03:35	askore	bajr: your face is real
2014-07-17 10:05:24	tamgc	why yes, yes those things are..
2014-07-17 10:05:51	dom	all of those things are real
2014-07-17 10:06:15	@bajr	except complex numbers, some of those are imaginary
2014-07-17 10:06:34	askore	nobody claimed those were real
2014-07-17 10:06:41	askore	don't be irrational
2014-07-17 10:06:44	askore	8D
2014-07-17 10:07:01	tamgc	bajr++ askore++
2014-07-17 10:07:26	@bajr	askore: that would be unnatural
2014-07-17 10:08:10	askore	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Real_numbers.svg/900px-Real_numbers.svg.png
2014-07-17 10:08:16	askore	sadly the joke ends as soon as I google it
2014-07-17 10:11:05	@bajr	sadly
2014-07-17 10:11:51	@bajr	obviously, we need to invent more numbers
2014-07-17 10:12:00	askore	he
2014-07-17 10:12:02	askore	h
2014-07-17 10:12:08	tamgc	hm
2014-07-17 10:12:14	askore	have you seen vi hart's recent videos about infinity
2014-07-17 10:12:14	tamgc	I propose the "bajr"
2014-07-17 10:12:16	askore	?
2014-07-17 10:12:37	askore	oh yeah! I confirmed this morning that I do in fact have AC.
2014-07-17 10:12:55	@bajr	i have seen those, they're pretty neat
2014-07-17 10:13:07	@bajr	how's the weather down there?
2014-07-17 10:13:11	askore	too hot
2014-07-17 10:13:13	tamgc	I mean we have "wookiees" and "foxes" as measurements...weight/height...
2014-07-17 10:13:13	@bajr	it's cloudy in seattle
2014-07-17 10:13:17	askore	which is why the AC thing is excellent
2014-07-17 10:13:41	askore	my apartment has been hovering around 77 for the last few weeks
2014-07-17 10:13:47	tamgc	it's been decent these last couple of days, was supposed to hit the 100 range, but cooled off
2014-07-17 10:13:54	askore	because I didn't bother to actually investigate the thermostat
2014-07-17 10:13:57	@bajr	maybe bajr could be term for the set of all CAT numbers
2014-07-17 10:14:03	askore	lol
2014-07-17 10:14:06	tamgc	bajr++
2014-07-17 10:14:07	askore	those are bajr numbers?
2014-07-17 10:14:30	@bajr	indeed
2014-07-17 10:14:38	 *	bajr nods sagely
2014-07-17 10:14:42	askore	karmabot: bajr is the set of numbers containing all CAT numbers, such as wookiee and fox
2014-07-17 10:14:42	karmabot	Affirmative, askore.
2014-07-17 10:14:44	tamgc	or maybe a "bajr" could be the distance between portland and alaska (via bike)
2014-07-17 10:14:57	@bajr	why not both?
2014-07-17 10:15:02	tamgc	so...you're saying wookiee and fox are in bajr...
2014-07-17 10:15:09	 *	tamgc snickers...
2014-07-17 10:15:22	@bajr	bajr is in bajr too :)
2014-07-17 10:15:30	askore	as is the way of numbers
2014-07-17 10:15:47	@bajr	bajr is a measure of distance, wookiee is a measure of weight, fox is a measure of height
2014-07-17 10:16:09	tamgc	and your mom's a measure in volume
2014-07-17 10:16:11	tamgc	>.> <.<
2014-07-17 10:16:22	askore	that one's universal though, not just in the bajr numbers
2014-07-17 10:16:41	askore	(we appear to be mixing and matching paradigms here but whatever)
2014-07-17 10:17:16	@bajr	which paradigms?
2014-07-17 10:17:29	askore	numbers are not the same things as units of measurement
2014-07-17 10:17:34	@bajr	this is true
2014-07-17 10:17:46	tamgc	(yep, but not as amusing)
2014-07-17 10:18:11	tamgc	well depends on how you refer to it I think
2014-07-17 10:18:13	askore	bajr numbers would be those such as "the temperature in the OMR"
2014-07-17 10:18:14	@bajr	i would like to include restaurant math within the bajr numbers
2014-07-17 10:18:32	tamgc	sort of like euler's number...
2014-07-17 10:18:35	askore	restaurant math can only be done on bajr numbers
2014-07-17 10:18:45	tamgc	you can then express things as some portion of that...
2014-07-17 10:18:45	askore	i.e. the price of a can of pepsi from the zuul
2014-07-17 10:18:48	askore	that is a bajr number
2014-07-17 10:18:49	tamgc	or pi/tau/etc
2014-07-17 10:18:52	@bajr	indeed
2014-07-17 10:19:15	tamgc	o.O restaurant math?
2014-07-17 10:19:23	tamgc	oh heh
2014-07-17 10:19:29	askore	yep
2014-07-17 10:19:34	 *	tamgc can read >.>
2014-07-17 10:19:37	askore	I hear it's powerful enough to drive spaceships
2014-07-17 10:20:30	@bajr	your face's mass to energy ratio is enough to drive spaceships >.>
2014-07-17 10:20:44	askore	something like that.
2014-07-17 10:20:47	 *	askore is hungry
2014-07-17 10:21:27	askore	bajr: rumor has it you'll be back soon, when derps?
2014-07-17 10:21:49	@bajr	askore: i board flight from SEA to PDX in 40 minutes
2014-07-17 10:22:12	tamgc	bajr: hm I think that's true, I think I saw something about the human body having the potential of multiple atomic bombs?
2014-07-17 10:22:31	askore	I kinda... doubt that?
2014-07-17 10:24:28	tamgc	http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2avryx/what_is_the_strangest_true_fact_about_the/cizaufg
2014-07-17 10:24:33	tamgc	rest of thread is pretty good too
2014-07-17 10:25:10	tamgc	so your face might be able to drive spaceships -.-
2014-07-17 10:25:29	 *	askore doesn't see sources
2014-07-17 10:25:50	askore	aside from a book which may or may not have sources
2014-07-17 10:26:56	dom	askore: its askreddit, there are no sources
2014-07-17 10:27:07	dom	askscience though... there are sources there
2014-07-17 10:27:07	tamgc	it's on askreddit, it must be true >.>
2014-07-17 10:27:11	dom	heh
2014-07-17 10:27:17	askore	lol
2014-07-17 10:28:21	tamgc	a sub comment sort of clarifies it as a "if every atom turned into pure energy" which apparently would require a reaction with equal mass of antimatter
2014-07-17 10:28:48	askore	so "your face, combined with a significant amount of antimatter, can drive spaceships"
2014-07-17 10:28:55	askore	got it
2014-07-17 10:29:03	tamgc	askore++ heh
2014-07-17 10:29:12	askore	(iow there's nothing significant about my face in that equation)
2014-07-17 10:29:59	tamgc	(which actually makes star trek's intermix ratio potentially real...)
2014-07-17 10:30:14	askore	lol
2014-07-17 10:30:42	askore	shouldn't there be a law about "all discussions which include the word "space" will eventually come to star trek"
2014-07-17 10:30:49	tamgc	your face's matter would be significant
2014-07-17 10:30:54	askore	"and most discussions that don't include it either"
2014-07-17 10:31:01	tamgc	I think there might be one already
2014-07-17 10:31:04	askore	probably
2014-07-17 10:31:08	askore	like the
2014-07-17 10:31:10	askore	ooh it's about to come true
2014-07-17 10:31:12	askore	the one about hitler
2014-07-17 10:31:14	askore	:P
2014-07-17 10:31:58	tamgc	heh
2014-07-17 10:32:07	tamgc	well, you just proved the hitler one =P
2014-07-17 10:32:15	tamgc	(wait no...nm...)
2014-07-17 10:32:22	askore	haha
2014-07-17 10:32:23	tamgc	not quite
2014-07-17 10:32:37	askore	no
2014-07-17 10:32:50	askore	I was comparing the proposed star trek law to the law about comparing things to hitler
2014-07-17 10:33:00	askore	which is close enough to count
2014-07-17 10:33:45	tamgc	hmm yes askore++ you've Hitler-ized it
2014-07-17 10:35:03	tamgc	(godwin's law for the hitler thing heh)
2014-07-17 10:36:03	askore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum
2014-07-17 10:36:05	askore	hehe
2014-07-17 10:36:31	askore	anyway
2014-07-17 10:36:33	askore	space
2014-07-17 10:36:36	askore	the final frontier
2014-07-17 10:37:52	tamgc	where no man has gone before
2014-07-17 10:38:01	askore	except spock and friends
2014-07-17 10:39:20	tamgc	heh "Spock and Friends" either a band name or a show -.-
2014-07-17 10:39:46	 *	askore smells food and is hungry :<
2014-07-17 10:50:51	tamgc	actually, guessing 2nd attempt at linux on a stick worked?
2014-07-17 10:50:57	askore	yes
2014-07-17 10:51:04	askore	uh not linux on a stick
2014-07-17 10:51:08	askore	just didn't install ubuntu
2014-07-17 10:51:36	askore	literally all other OS installers are smart enough not to just blindly pick /dev/sda
2014-07-17 10:52:28	askore	but now the windows partition is kinda screwed up for unknown reasons and I don't really care enough to mess with it
2014-07-17 10:52:33	askore	so I'm just using my own laptop
2014-07-17 10:52:35	@bajr	on the topic of the amount of energy in the matter of your face, if it were all converted to energy, it would indeed rival the power of the most powerful bombs
2014-07-17 10:52:51	askore	bajr: the point is that in order to do so you need a 1:1 ratio of antimatter.
2014-07-17 10:52:59	askore	at which point, it specifically being your face is a moot point.
2014-07-17 10:53:41	 *	askore ......
2014-07-17 10:54:23	tamgc	karmabot: askore is "...your face is a moot point."
2014-07-17 10:54:23	karmabot	OK, tamgc.
2014-07-17 10:54:56	@bajr	wouldn't necessarily require antimatter, strictly speaking (though that would be the most likely scenario causing it to happen)
2014-07-17 11:27:57	askore	:/
2014-07-17 11:29:01	askore	having a conversation with a friend, csv files come up, I figure out that "csv" stands for "comma separated values"... friend says "haha really? I workd that out in middle school"
2014-07-17 11:29:04	askore	well... ok then
2014-07-17 11:30:13	dom	wat
2014-07-17 11:30:20	dom	what are csv files
2014-07-17 11:30:33	askore	it's just like a normal text file but the fields are separated by commas
2014-07-17 11:30:36	mancat	a file that contains a list, whose values are seperated by commas
2014-07-17 11:30:43	tamgc	askore: bring up hitler, only route left
2014-07-17 11:30:50	askore	yeah clearly
2014-07-17 11:31:16	dom	isn't there a social theory
2014-07-17 11:31:22	dom	thats like bring up hitler and lose?
2014-07-17 11:31:35	askore	not really
2014-07-17 11:31:52	dom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law
2014-07-17 11:31:53	askore	I mean godwin's law
2014-07-17 11:31:54	dom	found it
2014-07-17 11:31:55	askore	right
2014-07-17 11:32:06	askore	I think "bring up hitler and lose" is kind of a big reduction of the concept
2014-07-17 11:32:24	dom	I guess
2014-07-17 11:35:45	askore	bleh, I want to go heat up leftovers and eat food
2014-07-17 11:35:57	askore	but I think the container they're in is not suitable for microwaving and I don't have an alternative
2014-07-17 11:36:05	dom	paper towels?
2014-07-17 11:36:10	dom	napkins?

2014-07-17 11:39:51	dom	I think thats the real question
2014-07-17 11:39:56	askore	like I think it would melt
2014-07-17 11:40:04	askore	rendering the microwave messy and the food inedible
2014-07-17 11:40:16	dom	dont put it in for that long?
2014-07-17 11:40:28	dom	do it for 30 seconds, if it hasn't melted, you're fine for another 30 seconds
2014-07-17 11:40:33	dom	then the food will be edible
2014-07-17 11:40:37	dom	mischief managed

2014-07-17 14:40:41	@bajr	always be greedy with hummus
2014-07-17 14:40:48	tamgc	or use the pretzel as a spoon

2014-07-17 14:46:32	askore	and I can't download stuff on my laptop and transfer it over on a usb drive because IT WON'T MOUNT IT
2014-07-17 14:46:33	tamgc	sounds more like a proxy issue -.-
2014-07-17 14:46:43	askore	no it's like a flash issue

2014-07-17 14:51:23	askore	the one workaround I've found is to put this shit in my public_html
2014-07-17 14:51:33	askore	and rename them so they don't have .exe file extensions
2014-07-17 14:51:36	askore	because that gets blocked
2014-07-17 14:51:37	@bajr	huh....
2014-07-17 14:52:05	askore	yeah

2014-07-17 14:59:48	askore	it's where the clock out time should be
2014-07-17 15:03:08	askore	the only boxes I can edit are "pay code" and "amount"

2014-07-17 19:14:01	relsqui	which was good, since I'd gotten no sleep whatsoever

2014-07-17 19:34:57	relsqui	strictly speaking it's not set in stone until I have actually handed over dollars for it which probably won't happen before I get paid
2014-07-17 19:35:01	stacybird	you have all karlas vids right?
2014-07-17 19:35:05	relsqui	yeah, I'm in the d2l shell

2014-07-17 19:41:23	relsqui	oooh, maybe objects
2014-07-17 19:41:27	relsqui	because they'll all have a verb for using it

2014-07-17 20:00:45	dom	OK
2014-07-17 20:05:26	relsqui	okay that's eerie, I dunno how vim knows that when I'm making a list of things and I end one with a comma, the next one should be indented
2014-07-17 20:05:30	relsqui	this isn't code, there's no syntax
2014-07-17 20:05:32	relsqui	I'm just writing english in a list
2014-07-17 20:07:08	dom	idk I like it
2014-07-17 20:07:15	relsqui	me too
2014-07-17 20:08:16	relsqui	(but it doesn't make up for vim unindenting comments that begin with # in interpreted languages because it thinks they're C compiler directives -_-)
2014-07-17 20:16:04	 *	relsqui sips tea, mancat++
2014-07-17 20:17:28	relsqui	ooh, it wasn't because of a comma, it was because the line started with for
2014-07-17 20:17:34	relsqui	it just did it again for a line that started with if and didn't end with a comma
2014-07-17 20:17:39	relsqui	basically, it thinks I'm writing a shell script
2014-07-17 20:17:46	relsqui	this is not a terrible assumption for me, it just doesn't happen to be true
2014-07-17 21:26:22	askore	ok
2014-07-17 21:26:29	askore	I have acquired admin access to the router
2014-07-17 21:26:30	relsqui	oh man, time to find out how good a job I did writing reusable code last term
2014-07-17 21:26:35	relsqui	because I want this linked list class again
2014-07-17 21:26:39	relsqui	and I wrote it for a totally different application
2014-07-17 21:26:51	relsqui	ditto my BST class
2014-07-17 21:26:56	askore	I must now change the ssid and passphrase to something customized and silly
2014-07-17 21:27:00	relsqui	I love past-Finn SO MUCH right now for writing me a BST class
2014-07-17 21:27:03	relsqui	askore: :D

2014-07-17 21:30:25	relsqui	which I'm still fucking proud of
2014-07-17 21:31:20	sabreman	using the console?
2014-07-17 21:32:57	sabreman	eitehr way though, I wanna see
2014-07-17 21:33:34	relsqui	yep!
2014-07-17 21:34:02	relsqui	cba to download my test script offhand to generate one, remind me later
2014-07-17 21:35:12	relsqui	sabreman: basically I walked into the cs lounge and asked john and mancat "talk me out of writing a bst pretty printer in C++"
2014-07-17 21:35:18	relsqui	and john was like DON'T DO IT it's harder than it sounds
2014-07-17 21:35:22	relsqui	I was like okay, thanks
2014-07-17 21:35:30	relsqui	... but like six hours later I said the same thing to kendall
2014-07-17 21:35:37	relsqui	and kendall was like "oh man lemme show you the one I wrote in haskell!"
2014-07-17 21:35:42	relsqui	...... because kendall <3
2014-07-17 21:35:44	sabreman	lol
2014-07-17 21:35:48	relsqui	so, obviously, then I had to write one >_>

2014-07-17 21:37:12	relsqui	k
2014-07-17 21:37:15	sabreman	is the digital version of magicv 2015 worth it
2014-07-17 21:37:17	relsqui	I think we can handle taht
2014-07-17 21:37:25	sabreman	like, have you (or anyone) played the digital versions before?
2014-07-17 21:37:34	relsqui	I haven't, but I know a number of people who have and I've heard good things
2014-07-17 21:37:38	relsqui	I'm not personally that interested
2014-07-17 21:37:41	sabreman	I feel like it would be really awkuard to handle instants in any digital mtg clone
2014-07-17 21:37:46	relsqui	but I've heard they're pretty good
2014-07-17 21:37:49	relsqui	oh, no, it's not that bad
2014-07-17 21:37:56	relsqui	it actually teaches you the turn progression reallyw ell
2014-07-17 21:38:09	relsqui	we talk about it like you can play instants "any time" but there's actually specified times each player has priority and may do so
2014-07-17 21:38:16	relsqui	and playing with a computer teaches you where they are :)
2014-07-17 21:38:20	sabreman	OH
2014-07-17 21:38:23	relsqui	(it just doesn't come up much in person)
2014-07-17 21:38:23	sabreman	had no idea
2014-07-17 21:38:32	sabreman	that's actualy knida col
2014-07-17 21:38:45	relsqui	if you wanna try playing with a computer for free, you could try Forge, which is linked from pdxmtg.com
2014-07-17 21:38:54	sabreman	yeah im gonna do that for sure
2014-07-17 21:39:31	sabreman	the magic 2015 game is against other people, and aperantly you can get all the cards from that edition with it. 
2014-07-17 21:39:31	relsqui	that'll give you an idea
2014-07-17 21:39:35	sabreman	But i haven't read to much into it
2014-07-17 21:39:43	relsqui	and then imagine that it was designed by professionals with a budget
2014-07-17 21:39:49	relsqui	and then decide if you wanna buy the official one, lol
2014-07-17 21:39:55	sabreman	puuuuurhaps
2014-07-17 21:39:58	sabreman	we'll see.

2014-07-20 00:31:54	dom	I read all of the wheel of time without getting bored, I think im immune to boring sections
2014-07-20 00:31:55	 *	nebrith grumbles
2014-07-20 00:32:08	nebrith	dom: you may have had a 3 month fever too
2014-07-20 00:32:21	dom	idk boooks is cool and shit
2014-07-20 00:32:24	nebrith	At least we can all agree Terry Goodkind's books are horseshit Objectivist crap
2014-07-20 00:32:31	nebrith	books is hella cool
2014-07-20 00:32:34	dom	I read through all of them too
2014-07-20 00:32:42	dom	they started so good :(
2014-07-20 00:32:54	Pash	I dunno nebs
2014-07-20 00:32:55	dom	I kept hoping it'd get better like WoT
2014-07-20 00:32:57	nebrith	Yeah but rape rape chicken evil rape rape mudpeople MUDPEOPLE statues rape
2014-07-20 00:33:06	nebrith	The prose is perfectly serviceable
2014-07-20 00:33:07	dom	yeah there was a lot of it
2014-07-20 00:33:09	Pash	but then, I haven't read Terry Goodkind since 8th grade
2014-07-20 00:33:12	nebrith	The author is terrible people
2014-07-20 00:33:24	dom	yah
2014-07-20 00:33:32	nebrith	The BOOKS aren't bad. The AUTHOR is a huge dick and once didn't hold an elevator for me at a con while looking right at me
2014-07-20 00:33:36	nebrith	I was 14
2014-07-20 00:33:37	nebrith	fuck Goodkind
2014-07-20 00:33:43	Pash	all I remember is something something giant worm, something something
2014-07-20 00:33:48	nebrith	Pash: that too
2014-07-20 00:33:51	dom	I liked the TV series better than the books honestly
2014-07-20 00:34:06	dom	they only did the first book, but still
2014-07-20 00:34:10	dom	thats the good one
2014-07-20 00:34:14	nebrith	dom: I liked the pretty ambiguously gay lady in red leather with the BDSM pain stick too >:3
2014-07-20 00:34:22	dom	she is gay
2014-07-20 00:34:27	nebrith	oh hey wow really
2014-07-20 00:34:34	dom	yeah, he comes out and says it
2014-07-20 00:34:38	nebrith	I thought my femslash glasses were on just too tight
2014-07-20 00:34:41	nebrith	Now i"m not sure what to think
2014-07-20 00:34:48	nebrith	She's totes an evil bitch.
2014-07-20 00:34:48	Pash	it sucks reading things as an adult that you read as a kid/teen
2014-07-20 00:34:55	Pash	brb
2014-07-20 00:35:04	nebrith	Pash: oh god I know I cringed finding my Anne Rice novels last time i was home
2014-07-20 00:35:16	nebrith	"Oh God I used to...HOLY SHIT MY PARENTS DIDN'T BURN THIS!?"
2014-07-20 00:35:35	dom	oh man I found an ayn rand novel last spring break
2014-07-20 00:35:55	dom	turns out I had cut a hole in it to hide my friend's weed, I hadn't been reading it
2014-07-20 00:36:02	dom	biggest sigh of relief ever
2014-07-20 00:36:14	nebrith	dom: HAHAHAHA
2014-07-20 00:36:29	nebrith	that's why the Goodkind books are bad to me. They're not even GOOD at preaching Objectivism like Rand
2014-07-20 00:36:49	dom	yeah, I
2014-07-20 00:36:53	nebrith	At least with Rand you're like "oh hey this is bits and pieces of other, better philosophies kinda cobbled together and as a teenager this is really empowering to be told you're totally inc ontrol and fuck everything"
2014-07-20 00:36:55	dom	've read the fountainhead for c;ases
2014-07-20 00:37:03	dom	classes
2014-07-20 00:37:06	nebrith	With Goodkind it's like "Holy fuck rape is bad why are you"
2014-07-20 00:37:13	nebrith	"like I don't care if she's evil rape is"
2014-07-20 00:37:28	nebrith	"OK that's just what you're gonna do now I guess. Wait don't you know mudpeople is a literal real slur??"
2014-07-20 00:38:09	dom	and the "women take complete control of men with no say in the matter amg"
2014-07-20 00:38:47	dom	some definite bitterness at an ex in there for goodkind
2014-07-20 00:38:48	nebrith	dom: well there's also the creepy rape scenes in Atlas Shrugged, too
2014-07-20 00:38:50	nebrith	I mean it's weird.
2014-07-20 00:38:57	nebrith	dom: yeah
2014-07-20 00:39:00	dom	theres lots of creepy rape scenes everywhere
2014-07-20 00:39:06	nebrith	I sense a lot of bitterness in Goodkind too
2014-07-20 00:39:19	nebrith	not Amaazing Atheist levels but pretty unsettling
2014-07-20 00:39:35	dom	to be fair, at least he hid some of it behind obscurity so younger readers wouldn't be corrupted
2014-07-20 00:39:45	nebrith	True that
2014-07-20 00:40:00	nebrith	I once saw a 12 year old boy happily sitting in the Hillsdale library reading like a stack of Goodkind
2014-07-20 00:40:16	Pash	I remember little enough gookind to be lost noe
2014-07-20 00:40:18	dom	if you read it only for the story, its not actually that bad
2014-07-20 00:40:19	Pash	now*
2014-07-20 00:40:40	dom	which is why I try not to analyze my fav series
2014-07-20 00:40:54	nebrith	I desperately wanted to run over, shout, distract him, throw them, and get him The Hobbit, A Wizard of Earthsea, and Harry Potter
2014-07-20 00:41:00	nebrith	dom: what's your fave series?
2014-07-20 00:41:16	nebrith	I try not to analyze much anymore,but sometimes it's right there.
2014-07-20 00:41:18	dom	i have lots, I just meant in general
2014-07-20 00:41:34	Pash	Sometimes I try to read old favorites again, it's a mized bag
2014-07-20 00:41:40	Pash	mixed*
2014-07-20 00:41:42	nebrith	My fave fantasy series atm is the Dresden Files because they're light and f un and htere's a million of 'em
2014-07-20 00:41:44	dom	yeah, I put on my dense goggles when I read so I can read even the most blaring bullshit and keep going for the worldbuilding
2014-07-20 00:42:01	nebrith	same with Vorkosigan Saga though both are really nicely built worlds without a lot of maps and bullshit
2014-07-20 00:42:03	dom	I like dresden files too much to pirate the books and not enough to buy them all
2014-07-20 00:42:08	Pash	I do like dresden files but I need to read them again
2014-07-20 00:42:18	Pash	I haven't read them since winter knight
2014-07-20 00:42:29	nebrith	dom: library!
2014-07-20 00:43:07	nebrith	also the Vorkosigan Saga, all 18 of them, can be found at Central Library and for mil sci-fi they're very readable and fun and funny and still rather serious in the dramatic tension
2014-07-20 00:43:34	dom	I've got more alt history to read
2014-07-20 00:43:44	Pash	I have totally made a D&D character based off of Michael Carpenter
2014-07-20 00:45:03	nebrith	Pash: it works
2014-07-20 00:45:18	dom	I like making characters based off of books
2014-07-20 00:45:27	dom	although I do it more in videogames as opposed to tabletops
2014-07-20 00:45:36	Pash	nebrith:  It totally did
2014-07-20 00:45:45	nebrith	Also is it wrong I imagine Michael Carpenter as Nick Giuntoli despite no reason to do so? http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1365912/
2014-07-20 00:45:48	nebrith	mmm Michael
2014-07-20 00:45:58	Pash	Vendrathon as my favorite paladin yet
2014-07-20 00:46:03	Pash	was*
2014-07-20 00:46:07	nebrith	That statement also works because my bf's name is Michael
2014-07-20 00:46:19	nebrith	But it was directed at dreamy grumpy Carpenter
2014-07-20 00:46:51	nebrith	I am rereading the first book after years of not reading and I forgot how much of a prick Harry is
2014-07-20 00:46:54	nebrith	I love it
2014-07-20 00:46:56	nebrith	I want to punch him so bad
2014-07-20 00:47:09	nebrith	But also pet him and bake him a pie and make fun of him
2014-07-20 00:47:11	dom	oh man if you like prick protagonists in fantasy settings
2014-07-20 00:47:13	dom	sandman slim
2014-07-20 00:47:29	dom	a guy is sent to hell and literally kills his way back to earth
2014-07-20 00:47:32	dom	hilarity ensues
2014-07-20 00:48:01	nebrith	http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3823216384/nm1365912?ref_=nm_phs_md_1 see Harry
2014-07-20 00:48:55	nebrith	dom: is he a creep like the Thomas Covenant?
2014-07-20 00:49:36	dom	I don't know the reference
2014-07-20 00:50:22	nebrith	only a suuuper asshole protagonist
2014-07-20 00:50:38	dom	well, sandman slim is an asshole, but he isn't really a creep
2014-07-20 00:50:49	nebrith	Accidentally enters a fantasy alternate world, immediately realizes he doesn't have debilitating leprosy anymore, rapes a girl
2014-07-20 00:50:58	dom	ahh he isn't like that
2014-07-20 00:50:59	nebrith	Spends the rest of the books trying to atone
2014-07-20 00:51:08	nebrith	Did not read
2014-07-20 00:51:13	dom	he is more like a vigilante
2014-07-20 00:51:20	nebrith	All I know is trying to pick them up and just being unable to
2014-07-20 00:51:30	nebrith	ahhh
2014-07-20 00:51:31	dom	like a loose cannon cop playing by his own rules
2014-07-20 00:51:35	nebrith	that works
2014-07-20 00:51:38	dom	dgaffing and shit
2014-07-20 00:51:39	dom	you know
2014-07-20 00:52:05	nebrith	I just have a really hard time with rape in fantasy novels. They're usually not done for horror, but for titillation and it's just too much for me.
2014-07-20 00:52:21	nebrith	and sadly it's done a lot. GRRM almost kinda sorta shows how scary it is for the right reasons.
2014-07-20 00:52:33	dom	nah, there isn't any rape
2014-07-20 00:54:26	nebrith	good
2014-07-20 00:54:35	nebrith	I have had two Amazon accts for years and this still continues to vex me
2014-07-20 00:54:42	nebrith	One is a prime acct with my pdx account
2014-07-20 00:54:48	nebrith	Obvs not going to delete that one
2014-07-20 00:54:55	nebrith	But the other is my personal email with ALL MY BOOKS
2014-07-20 00:55:00	nebrith	obviously can't delete that one either
2014-07-20 00:55:05	nebrith	can't link them
2014-07-20 00:55:19	nebrith	So one is for TV/Music/shipping and the other is tied to my phone for books :<
2014-07-20 00:55:27	nebrith	First world OCD problems
2014-07-20 00:56:16	dom	hah
2014-07-20 00:56:32	nebrith	yeah
2014-07-20 00:56:36	nebrith	Reaaaally bugs me
2014-07-20 00:56:43	nebrith	There's too much worth on either account
2014-07-20 00:56:44	nebrith	:<
2014-07-20 00:56:54	nebrith	I accidentally bought prime logged into the wrong account once
2014-07-20 00:57:07	nebrith	Now i'm too cheap to throw down $99 on my main one
2014-07-20 00:57:22	Pash	in other news
2014-07-20 00:57:31	Pash	Thor is my new favorite disney princess
2014-07-20 00:57:46	nebrith	Sandman Slim bought
2014-07-20 00:57:57	nebrith	Pash; omg on fb I got into an argument with a Asatru idiot today
2014-07-20 00:58:17	Pash	arguing on FB? sounds like a bad idea
2014-07-20 00:59:35	nebrith	yeah
2014-07-20 00:59:37	nebrith	I felt bad
2014-07-20 00:59:49	nebrith	he called me a bitch
2014-07-20 01:00:16	nebrith	because I told him to get out ofmy fanbase if he cares more about the sanctity of a character's whiteness or maleness than if the story is good
2014-07-20 01:00:34	nebrith	he said he believed in Asatru and giving Mjolnir to someone other than Thor is offensive to his religion
2014-07-20 01:00:58	nebrith	(He is actually and idiot and Asatru dudes don't really give much of a fuck about Thor, he's in the pantheon but it's all about Odin.)
2014-07-20 01:01:01	nebrith	an*
2014-07-20 01:01:21	nebrith	He's just an edgy racist kid, likely, as Asatru is inextricably linked with white power movements in Europe and most of the US. 
2014-07-20 01:01:34	dom	yeah, serious shame, that
2014-07-20 01:02:06	nebrith	I mean Asatru is a damn nifty modern heathenism
2014-07-20 01:02:15	nebrith	but it's all tied with white power
2014-07-20 01:02:20	dom	thor is tied to a lot of religious asatru stuff depending on the local group
2014-07-20 01:02:31	dom	a lot of it is, yeah
2014-07-20 01:02:58	nebrith	:/ I studied what we call Vikings for like a quarter in a joint history and English course where we read and translated the Eddas from Old English and Old Norse to MNE and it was so great
2014-07-20 01:03:03	nebrith	I'd get runes on me but again
2014-07-20 01:03:04	nebrith	white power
2014-07-20 01:03:19	dom	yeah
2014-07-20 01:03:30	nebrith	And it sucks too because Polish runes are actually a point of heritage for me but there's NO WAY I would ever get Polish runes because they are in no way NOT white power over there
2014-07-20 01:03:37	dom	I really like the concept of Asatru, wiccanism without the hippy bullshit
2014-07-20 01:03:45	nebrith	Even Norse runes you could do the whole Asatru excuse
2014-07-20 01:03:50	dom	but in practice its like oooh I don't hate black people sorry guys
2014-07-20 01:03:57	Pash	admittedly, it's always a little weird when someone takes a myth and is like, "Well, we're gonna gender swap this"
2014-07-20 01:03:59	nebrith	Polish runes? No way. All they do all day is "paki sack"
2014-07-20 01:04:19	nebrith	Pash: yeah but Thor has been a zombie and a baby and a like a gorilla
2014-07-20 01:04:29	nebrith	This is not the first time it's happened, and it's in the Eddas, too.
2014-07-20 01:04:31	dom	pop culture clashing with ancient pop culture
2014-07-20 01:04:35	nebrith	Thor crossdresses all the time.
2014-07-20 01:04:38	Pash	I'm sure.  Most legends have been fucked with a hundred ways
2014-07-20 01:04:46	Pash	that doesn't make any new one less odd
2014-07-20 01:04:55	nebrith	Pash: I mean in the ocmics he was a baby and a gorilla
2014-07-20 01:05:06	nebrith	Not in the myths. I don't think the ancient Norse saw gorillas that often
2014-07-20 01:05:10	dom	yeah
2014-07-20 01:05:15	nebrith	Then again they DID trade with the Moors
2014-07-20 01:05:18	dom	in the myths he crossdresses to trick people
2014-07-20 01:05:26	nebrith	motherfuckers traded with everyone
2014-07-20 01:05:27	dom	not really for pleasure\
2014-07-20 01:05:30	dom	"traded"
2014-07-20 01:05:32	nebrith	oh well of course I know
2014-07-20 01:05:44	nebrith	dom: you give me your stuff, I give you a knuckle sandwich
2014-07-20 01:05:47	nebrith	totally cromulent trade
2014-07-20 01:06:01	dom	also pls to worship the Allfather
2014-07-20 01:06:03	dom	kthx
2014-07-20 01:06:03	nebrith	also Vikings were only one social class in the Norse social hierarchy, they really did legit trade >_>
2014-07-20 01:06:08	dom	yeah I know
2014-07-20 01:06:13	nebrith	just...
2014-07-20 01:06:17	dom	Vikings did way more trading than pillaging
2014-07-20 01:06:18	nebrith	sometimes they were like the mob about trade
2014-07-20 01:06:27	nebrith	they also have purty hair :3c
2014-07-20 01:06:29	Pash	I mean, I like the idea of Thor as a lady, because then Thor is my new favorite disney princess.  But my point is that changing legends for most any reason is often weird, and, to me, seems to usually be done becuase of politcal reasons, which to me, aren't.
2014-07-20 01:06:39	nebrith	If i ever got thrown into the past I'd find a viking
2014-07-20 01:06:51	nebrith	he's less likely to have syphillis and way more likely to bathe and be literate
2014-07-20 01:07:01	dom	depending on the time ofc
2014-07-20 01:07:06	nebrith	Pash: true dat
2014-07-20 01:07:08	dom	more like to fall in the water sometimes too
2014-07-20 01:07:46	nebrith	dom: let's just say I'm thinking the early to high middle ages and maybe a smidgen of the Italian Renaissance (the Norse had a much later Renaissance by that point because Teutonic hordes)
2014-07-20 01:07:52	Pash	Like, just let old legends be, if we need more lady heroes, we can make them 
2014-07-20 01:08:09	nebrith	Pash: tbh I agree on that count, but I mean, she /does/ look pretty badass.
2014-07-20 01:08:13	dom	yeah, if they wanted a norse goddess of battle, there's plenty of candidates who could be made
2014-07-20 01:08:18	Pash	I also agree with that
2014-07-20 01:08:30	nebrith	I think they should actually make a comic about Sif or Freya as a main character
2014-07-20 01:08:34	dom	honestly, all the fuckery with canon in comics puts me off em entirely
2014-07-20 01:08:38	Pash	Lady Thor does lool badass
2014-07-20 01:08:41	nebrith	THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE COMICS
2014-07-20 01:08:49	Pash	right?
2014-07-20 01:09:00	nebrith	dom: the trick is to find an artist and writer you like and follow them
2014-07-20 01:09:07	dom	or to just not
2014-07-20 01:09:16	nebrith	well that's fair too, just saying
2014-07-20 01:09:19	dom	yeah I know
2014-07-20 01:09:26	nebrith	the fanboys also just legit put most people off
2014-07-20 01:09:36	dom	yes, that too
2014-07-20 01:09:44	nebrith	Someone who cares more about what some writer did for six issues 10 years ago rather than telling a new cool story just...ugh
2014-07-20 01:10:22	nebrith	At least superhero comics aren't all there are!
2014-07-20 01:10:27	Pash	people who get too serious and resistant to change are in general, repugnant
2014-07-20 01:10:30	 *	nebrith is really enjoying Rat Queens
2014-07-20 01:10:40	nebrith	Pash: yeah. they really just make me eyeroll
2014-07-20 01:10:48	nebrith	actually you both would enjoy Rat Queens
2014-07-20 01:10:56	nebrith	snarky fantasy adventurer ladies
2014-07-20 01:11:06	nebrith	and the badass dudes who sadly have to put up with them
2014-07-20 01:11:22	nebrith	not because they're bad at their job or cranky
2014-07-20 01:11:28	nebrith	but because they're not really quite that good at their jobs.
2014-07-20 01:11:42	nebrith	They're kind of...gleefully bad at actually adventuring.
2014-07-20 01:12:23	dom	I just wanna live in the woods and build log cabins and bonfires and get free wifi
2014-07-20 01:12:27	dom	is that so wrong
2014-07-20 01:12:52	Pash	I'd join you
2014-07-20 01:13:30	Pash	I'd even sneak into ton to steal marshmallows and toilet paper
2014-07-20 01:13:52	dom	well, we'd be payed by the townsfolk to protect them from dragons and stuff
2014-07-20 01:14:15	Pash	even better.  Buying TP is easier than stealing it
2014-07-20 01:14:16	dom	but we could steal for the halibut
2014-07-20 01:14:36	nebrith	brb slurpee time
2014-07-20 01:14:38	nebrith	want slurpee
2014-07-20 01:14:47	dom	i want slurpee
2014-07-20 01:15:18	Pash	me tooooooo
2014-07-20 01:15:34	Pash	there are no slurpees downtown....
2014-07-20 01:16:04	relsqui	really?
2014-07-20 01:16:15	relsqui	I guess it's plaid territory
2014-07-20 01:17:09	relsqui	lol I have changed literally every file in this repo since last commit
2014-07-20 01:17:10	relsqui	neat
2014-07-20 01:17:17	Pash	there's a 7-11 down 20+ blocks away, but I don't think they're 24 hours
2014-07-20 01:17:33	dom	7-11 not open 24-7 is shit
2014-07-20 01:17:49	Pash	right?  fuckers.
2014-07-20 01:18:16	relsqui	yeah
2014-07-20 01:18:19	Pash	@portlandproblems no one is open 24/7
2014-07-20 01:18:24	relsqui	oh man
2014-07-20 01:18:29	relsqui	there is SO MUCH MORE open 24/7 here than where I come from
2014-07-20 01:18:35	relsqui	you cannot, legally, stay open all night in berkeley
2014-07-20 01:18:38	Pash	except subway
2014-07-20 01:18:42	relsqui	aiui there's literally nothing zoned for it
2014-07-20 01:19:22	dom	subway and plaid are like the only things
2014-07-20 01:19:42	dom	literally everything is open 24/7 in anchorage since so many jobs up there are industrial
2014-07-20 01:19:51	Pash	I don't even like subay
2014-07-20 01:19:56	Pash	subway*
2014-07-20 01:20:04	dom	I like the club sandwich, and thats really about it
2014-07-20 01:20:13	dom	also they sell salt and vinegar chips
2014-07-20 01:20:13	relsqui	I would rather have an actual subway that's open 24/7 than a Subway
2014-07-20 01:20:52	Pash	even at 3am, when the only other customers were strippers, that didn't bring subway above the grade of "Well, I won't be hungry after a 6inch..."
2014-07-20 01:21:29	dom	ehh I got really low standards
2014-07-20 01:22:18	Pash	TEDDY I LIKE MCNUGGETS.  DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT STANDARDS.
2014-07-20 01:22:29	dom	mcnuggets are delicious
2014-07-20 01:22:36	dom	I love them
2014-07-20 01:22:50	Pash	I love them on a mcdouble.
2014-07-20 01:23:14	Pash	also, by previous experience, I love them with green eggs and ham
2014-07-20 01:23:27	dom	I love them by themselves with bbq sauce
2014-07-20 01:23:53	Pash	I prefer ranch
2014-07-20 01:33:47	relsqui	things that make me nervous: mail from student financial services
2014-07-20 01:33:55	relsqui	but it's just "pls to pay for locker again"
2014-07-20 01:42:30	nebrith	oh hai
2014-07-20 01:42:40	nebrith	sluuuurpeee
2014-07-20 01:42:51	nebrith	Pash: there needs to be a 24/7 chinese food place
2014-07-20 01:42:55	nebrith	I'm very angry there is not one here
2014-07-20 01:42:59	nebrith	it's a fucking college town
2014-07-20 01:43:14	 *	relsqui never heard of such a thing
2014-07-20 01:43:18	 *	relsqui forgets where nebrith is from
2014-07-20 01:43:26	nebrith	relsqui: central Ohio.
2014-07-20 01:43:42	nebrith	Less restrictions. 24/7 delivery was super common by the OSU
2014-07-20 01:43:55	relsqui	dang
2014-07-20 01:43:59	nebrith	Then again that was by the OSU.
2014-07-20 01:44:02	Pash	I concur berith
2014-07-20 01:44:10	Pash	nebrith* lol
2014-07-20 01:44:57	Pash	I suspect that a chinese place, with even just decent food, could make a killing here by delivering and being open all night
2014-07-20 01:45:56	nebrith	Pash: 900 SW 4th
2014-07-20 01:46:04	nebrith	that's where i just went

2014-07-20 01:48:32	nebrith	right?
2014-07-20 01:48:44	Pash	totally
2014-07-20 01:48:50	Pash	or even just at my apartment
2014-07-20 01:50:35	relsqui	delivery to fab is hard because access control
2014-07-20 01:50:39	relsqui	I guess you'd have to go meet them is all
2014-07-20 01:50:53	Pash	delivery anywhere here is hard because no one does it
2014-07-20 01:50:59	Pash	not for chinese, anyay
2014-07-20 01:53:05	relsqui	well, also that
2014-07-20 01:55:58	Pash	I'd easily pay 5$ extra to get delivery chinese at 1am
2014-07-20 01:56:15	Pash	just because otherwise I can't have it
2014-07-20 01:56:31	relsqui	IOW capitalism
2014-07-20 01:57:31	Pash	Except no one is spplying this demand.
2014-07-20 02:00:45	Pash	:D stand by me came up on shuffle
2014-07-20 02:18:03	nebrith	Pash: obviously we should write to August Moon and beg for them to open up a 24/7 food cart
2014-07-20 02:35:34	Pash	right?
2014-07-20 02:46:58	Pash	in the meantime, I'm reading erfworld again

2014-07-20 12:25:41	 *	relsqui looks up what that actually is
2014-07-20 12:26:21	relsqui	Pliny (VIII.72-73) also writes of another hyena-like creature, the leucrocotta, which he calls "the swiftest of all beasts, about the size of an ass, with a stag's haunches, a lion's neck, tail and breast, badger's head, cloven hoof, mouth opening right back to the ears, and ridges of bone in place of rows of teeth--this animal is reported to imitate the voices of human beings."
2014-07-20 12:26:50	relsqui	sounds about right
2014-07-20 12:26:55	 *	relsqui is nototirous for imitating the voices of human beings

2014-07-20 13:39:45	relsqui	it turns out that mancat threatening to bug me about getting my code written is surprisingly effective at getting me to write code
2014-07-20 13:39:49	relsqui	no one is more surprised than me
2014-07-20 13:42:45	dom	i think i lost my flash drive anyway

2014-07-20 13:49:20	relsqui	mancat: anything ever come of talking to landlord about staying?
2014-07-20 13:49:47	relsqui	of that idea, I mean
2014-07-20 13:58:28	mancat	i haven't talked to her yet
2014-07-20 13:58:31	mancat	my dad is bugging me to
2014-07-20 13:58:34	mancat	i think he's right
2014-07-20 13:58:38	mancat	it's kinda late, but it doesn't hurt to ask
2014-07-20 13:58:43	relsqui	yeah, exactly
2014-07-20 13:58:47	mancat	i need to get her number
2014-07-20 13:58:57	relsqui	from roommates?
2014-07-20 14:01:27	relsqui	ZZ
2014-07-20 14:01:40	relsqui	^ typed this into the wrong terminal but left it for your amusement
2014-07-20 15:32:51	 *	mancat shakes relsqui. wake up!
2014-07-20 15:33:04	 *	relsqui wobbles
2014-07-20 15:33:10	relsqui	I was just trying to save a file!
2014-07-20 15:40:46	relsqui	urgh
2014-07-20 15:40:51	relsqui	really grumpy about something from other irc
2014-07-20 15:44:07	relsqui	tldr "so I'm building this site with user profiles that include gender, how can I inclusively/respectfully ask for gender?" "have you considered just having male/female or male/female/other radio buttons and moving on with your life?"
2014-07-20 15:44:23	relsqui	^ second person did not appear to understand why that response made me angry
2014-07-20 15:45:36	relsqui	(knowing I'm gq)
2014-07-20 15:45:52	relsqui	and it's not that that shouldn't ever be considered, I will 100% admit it
2014-07-20 15:46:08	relsqui	but, like, I don't think there's too much danger of people forgetting that they can just do it the lazy way and leave people out
2014-07-20 15:47:25	dom	well, outside of just having a button labeled other and a box for people to type in what they would like to be classified as, what other feasible options are there?
2014-07-20 15:47:40	dom	you cant have a radio button for everything
2014-07-20 15:49:04	relsqui	sure, I mean, how to actually do it is an interesting question which we went on to discuss
2014-07-20 15:49:12	relsqui	and which I did a talk about at osb and have thought a lot about
2014-07-20 15:49:39	relsqui	it's complicated for reasons beyond UI (e.g. if you have an activity feed, how do you pronoun people)
2014-07-20 15:49:58	relsqui	what annoyed me was short-circuiting that whole conversation just to be like "no, you should ignore those people"
2014-07-20 15:50:11	relsqui	when that wasn't even part of the question
2014-07-20 15:50:15	relsqui	the premise of the question was that it was being don
2014-07-20 15:50:15	relsqui	e
2014-07-20 15:54:14	mancat	yeah that's prety inconsiderate
2014-07-20 15:54:54	 *	mancat stretches hands, feels a little better after sending out 12 housing inquiries by email and 1 by text
2014-07-20 15:55:35	mancat	>_> for the record, there are a WHOLE lot more ads on craigslist for rooms for rent than for two-bedroom apartments for rent
2014-07-20 15:55:58	dom	I know >>
2014-07-20 15:56:01	 *	mancat shakes the classifieds tree, and $450 rooms on Alberta rain down
2014-07-20 15:56:09	dom	damn really ?
2014-07-20 15:56:14	mancat	pretty much
2014-07-20 15:56:44	dom	Im probably just going to stay in housing another year honestly
2014-07-20 15:56:52	dom	my standards don't demand my moving out
2014-07-20 15:56:53	mancat	selecting for only places that are $500 or less and in biking distance of downtown and are people that osund cool and are in neighborhoods and are two or less days old i've already hit 13 candidates
2014-07-20 15:56:57	mancat	and the list isn't even done yet
2014-07-20 15:57:09	dom	might have to take a look
2014-07-20 15:57:24	mancat	i jsut hate the housing department at psu
2014-07-20 15:57:28	mancat	honestly i kind of hate most of psu
2014-07-20 15:57:37	mancat	my student experience has not overall been that positive
2014-07-20 15:57:44	mancat	great people, and the cat is a++
2014-07-20 15:57:55	mancat	but if it weren't for that i might have considered bailing for another school
2014-07-20 15:58:05	mancat	even with the ensuing move and everything
2014-07-20 15:58:45	mancat	i think the average class quality is a lot higher at PCC, which is kind of funny
2014-07-20 15:59:40	dom	yeah I think portland state operates much more on the community college niche than PCC
2014-07-20 16:00:00	dom	being a school for people not in normal college age range
2014-07-20 16:00:27	dom	from what I've seen ofc
2014-07-20 16:13:10	mancat	lots of people outside the usual college demographic at PCC too
2014-07-20 16:13:17	mancat	but that's not really what i'm talking about
2014-07-20 16:13:33	mancat	the classes at PSU are all over the place. some are great, but a lot are fuciing terrible :\
2014-07-20 16:17:53	dom	yeah

2014-07-20 16:20:17	relsqui	what? haha
2014-07-20 16:22:08	relsqui	mancat: I find it interesting that your experience here is that different from mine. possibly in part because you're actually doing general eds here and I'm mostly not
2014-07-20 16:22:22	relsqui	karmabot: c
2014-07-20 16:22:22	karmabot	C(2007): a karmawhore, degrees, a gnarlier, "brogrammers-only" version of C, a village bicycle, strongly typed apparently, flail until it builds, gives you enough rope to shoot yourself in someone else's foot., CPlusPlus = CPP, the types are more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules, the true neckbeard language, where everything's unsafe and the types don't matter, the preferred language of pirates
2014-07-20 16:22:26	relsqui	okay, I get that one

2014-07-20 23:04:31	jesusaurus	nah, i felt a little bad about being on irc more than in person, but when in rome...

2014-07-20 23:18:49	nebrith	my workplace didn't USED to block imgur but now I can't see it on anyone else's screen when I walk by
2014-07-20 23:19:25	nebrith	fb, reddit, youtube, etc are the obvious blocks but some people seem to stream sports sites fine. :/

2014-07-21 12:56:06	askore	hmmmm
2014-07-21 12:56:26	askore	I mean there is a nice stack of foam pads under the desk that seem specifically designed for napping...
2014-07-21 12:56:40	askore	but I don't have my nap-hoodie so it would be much harder to fall asleep

2014-07-21 14:59:02	Nathan	anyone here have a Mac or Linux PC, and would be willing to test those builds of my game?
2014-07-21 14:59:09	Nathan	in exchange for a free copy of my game?
2014-07-21 14:59:38	Nathan	by "test" I just mean "make sure it runs"; I don't need beta feedback or anything
2014-07-21 15:01:13	dom	sure, I'm running #! on my laptop
2014-07-21 15:01:23	dom	don't think I could get to it until later tonight though
2014-07-21 15:01:23	nightfly	sure, /me runs Fedora 20 linux
2014-07-21 15:01:33	nightfly	and same, as about to head to oscon

2014-07-21 15:40:27	Nathan	oh whoops
2014-07-21 15:40:31	--	Nathan is now known as NMcCoy
2014-07-21 15:40:36	relsqui	much better
2014-07-21 15:40:36	relsqui	*g*
2014-07-21 15:40:45	NMcCoy	my default nick in irssi is wrong
2014-07-21 15:40:54	NMcCoy	and I haven't figured out how to successfully change it
2014-07-21 15:41:27	NMcCoy	also, would you happen to know of any way that I can chmod+x a file within a zip file, on Windows?
2014-07-21 15:41:41	askore	a file within a zip file?
2014-07-21 15:41:43	askore	errr
2014-07-21 15:41:49	askore	well windows doesn't have a concept of chmod
2014-07-21 15:42:06	NMcCoy	yes, I am aware of this
2014-07-21 15:42:11	askore	usually all windows files have the execute bit set when you move them to *nix
2014-07-21 15:42:30	askore	they might be 777 but I can't remember
2014-07-21 15:42:33	NMcCoy	this is unfortunately not the case for my particular situation
2014-07-21 15:42:36	askore	hmmm
2014-07-21 15:42:50	askore	probably best to unzip it on a nix computer, chmod it, and zip it back up
2014-07-21 15:42:59	NMcCoy	yeah, that's the most direct solution
2014-07-21 15:43:12	NMcCoy	problem is my *nix computer is a pretty big pain to use
2014-07-21 15:43:40	askore	virtual machines are pretty straightforward
2014-07-21 15:43:44	NMcCoy	and so if there's a handy tool that makes that unnecessary
2014-07-21 15:43:55	askore	not that I know
2014-07-21 15:43:57	askore	of
2014-07-21 16:08:44	@bajr	NMcCoy: what kind of game is that?
2014-07-21 17:31:00	@bajr	this was an interesting read: http://www.deathcookie.com/index.php/blogs/cussin-in-tongues/226-introducing-your-character-not-your-sheet
2014-07-21 17:31:56	relsqui	I just read the url and now I want a cookie
2014-07-21 17:32:42	@bajr	ooh, i should make oatmeal scones >.>
2014-07-21 17:34:26	relsqui	... haha there's a hudson hawk joke in there
2014-07-21 17:34:32	relsqui	'... it's perfectly fine to describe his love of unmasculine European coffee even if he doesn't have a "Cappuccino Appreciation" Skill. '
2014-07-21 17:34:40	relsqui	that++
2014-07-21 17:34:58	relsqui	bajr: yeah, stuff like that is what I like about the game I'm in right now
2014-07-21 17:34:59	@bajr	heh, missed that reference
2014-07-21 17:35:14	relsqui	bajr: it helps to have seen it enough times to recognize the phrase "unmasculine European coffee"
2014-07-21 17:35:22	@bajr	lol
2014-07-21 17:36:56	relsqui	I'm thinking about how we did that in this game
2014-07-21 17:37:13	relsqui	I think it was just "so you've been chained to an oar with these guys for a month. what do they see when they look over at you?"
2014-07-21 17:37:45	@bajr	relsqui: what game? sounds fun
2014-07-21 17:37:55	relsqui	li'l 4e game
2014-07-21 17:38:52	relsqui	this is also the one where I was like "I like the story bits and don't really care about the mechanical bits." and got the reply "Okay, just say what you wanna do and we'll help you figure out how to numbers if you need to"
2014-07-21 17:38:55	@bajr	rags to riches style I take it? being as you guys started chained to a boat?
2014-07-21 17:39:04	relsqui	I still have not read the mechanics at all
2014-07-21 17:39:13	relsqui	I read a couple pages of sourcebook because I was curious about some specific feats
2014-07-21 17:39:27	relsqui	bajr: I am not at all assuming there's going to be riches >_>
2014-07-21 17:39:32	relsqui	I guess we're doing okay for ourselves now
2014-07-21 17:39:33	@bajr	hehe
2014-07-21 17:39:42	@bajr	so rags to freedom?
2014-07-21 17:39:50	relsqui	freedom is a complicated concept in this context
2014-07-21 17:39:54	relsqui	we are, sort of, free
2014-07-21 17:40:11	 *	bajr headscratch
2014-07-21 17:40:19	relsqui	we can't go *home*
2014-07-21 17:40:23	relsqui	but we're not particularly otherwise inhibited
2014-07-21 17:40:48	@bajr	aha
2014-07-21 17:40:48	relsqui	and we're, like, clothed and supplied and have a little pocket money
2014-07-21 17:40:51	relsqui	and have made a couple of friends
2014-07-21 17:40:54	relsqui	and an impressive number of enemies
2014-07-21 17:41:11	relsqui	we seem to have a talent for that
2014-07-21 17:41:56	@bajr	i hope it wasn't something like this: http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1378/49/1378498143512.jpg
2014-07-21 17:42:16	@bajr	although... that is its own kind of fun
2014-07-21 17:42:59	relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-21 17:43:07	relsqui	we've only lit, like
2014-07-21 17:43:09	relsqui	two buildings on fire
2014-07-21 17:43:12	@bajr	hahaha
2014-07-21 17:43:14	relsqui	and only one was in a town
2014-07-21 17:43:18	relsqui	and neither one had humans in it
2014-07-21 17:43:20	@bajr	uh huh
2014-07-21 17:43:29	relsqui	uh
2014-07-21 17:43:30	relsqui	that we know of, I guess
2014-07-21 17:43:34	@bajr	lol
2014-07-21 17:44:04	relsqui	it's more stabbing
2014-07-21 17:44:27	@bajr	"The barmaid winks at you" "Stab"
2014-07-21 17:44:47	@bajr	"The goblin winks at you" "Stab"
2014-07-21 17:45:03	@bajr	"There is a statue" "Stab"
2014-07-21 17:45:07	relsqui	hahaha
2014-07-21 17:45:16	relsqui	no more like
2014-07-21 17:45:21	relsqui	"the barmaid winks at you" "sleep with her"
2014-07-21 17:45:25	relsqui	"the goblin winks at you" "sleep with it"
2014-07-21 17:45:30	relsqui	"there is a statue" "does it have any holes in it?"
2014-07-21 17:45:33	@bajr	oh *that* kind of stabbing
2014-07-21 17:45:35	relsqui	well
2014-07-21 17:45:36	relsqui	both
2014-07-21 17:45:38	relsqui	but different people
2014-07-21 17:45:40	@bajr	lol
2014-07-21 17:45:50	relsqui	winking barmaids definitely get the more figurative stabbing

2014-07-22 15:17:44	kendall	probably both, skewing towards the latter
2014-07-22 15:17:50	kendall	I can't really eat any candy anymore

2014-07-22 15:19:57	relsqui	but some I can still eat and don't really notice a difference
2014-07-22 15:20:00	relsqui	so this has probably also gotten worse

2014-07-22 20:30:37	askore	lol
2014-07-22 20:30:44	 *	bajr should probably be more involved in events like these if he's going to ever improve his skills
2014-07-22 20:30:46	 *	askore is sitting on a couch thing trying to openstack and watching nibz and blkperl write their talk
2014-07-22 20:31:00	stacybird	LOL
2014-07-22 20:31:02	tamgc	(er scrollback -.-)
2014-07-22 20:31:41	@bajr	tamgc: disregard scrollback, i've learned not to read it
2014-07-22 20:32:24	tamgc	heh I generally do that, then scrollback a little if on-screen topic's of interest to skim a bit
2014-07-22 21:33:59	askore	hmmmm
2014-07-22 21:34:09	askore	newegg claims that my computer parts will get here today
2014-07-22 21:34:29	askore	but given that the only tracking entry it has is "data entry" in california, I don't think that's true.
2014-07-22 21:34:49	relsqui	... I'm pretty sure I'm waiting on something to be shipped to me but I forget what
2014-07-22 21:34:52	relsqui	glasses, I think. dunno what else
2014-07-22 21:34:54	askore	heh
2014-07-22 21:35:08	askore	I should do an optometrist appointment
2014-07-22 21:35:13	askore	oh also like a dentist appointment
2014-07-22 21:35:26	askore	....and get a new phone
2014-07-22 21:44:47	tamgc	relsqui: search emails for "ship"?
2014-07-22 21:45:43	relsqui	I just did, haha
2014-07-22 22:29:25	nebrith	askore: we should remind each other.
2014-07-22 22:29:59	nebrith	I need to go to the optometrist for my contacts. And an OCD test lab at OHSU. And buy a new shower curtain.
2014-07-22 22:30:05	nebrith	And the dentist
2014-07-22 22:30:08	nebrith	And PPCo.
2014-07-22 22:30:32	nebrith	This entire "having insurance" thing is still suuuper weird to me. Like I can go to the doctor? For mostly free? What is this, GERMANY?
2014-07-22 22:30:46	nebrith	http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=KaBX42J6 <== hilarious and relevant to the thread. Not mine.
2014-07-23 00:32:15	dom	bajr: things wednesday evening?
2014-07-23 00:42:11	relsqui	which ... wihch thread is that relevant to
2014-07-23 00:52:44	dom	his tabletop things
2014-07-23 01:14:29	relsqui	this is tabletop, we weren't talking about tabletop things in here 8)
2014-07-23 07:12:28	tamgc	this is #tabletop, where the topics are made up and the points don't matter? heh
2014-07-23 08:24:14	Fetter	where is the wednesday evening game held?  is it on campus somewhere?
2014-07-23 08:56:50	-->	sabreman_work (~ultra_sab@193.18.92.162) has joined #tabletop
2014-07-23 11:07:31	relsqui	-_- I officially don't get oscon
2014-07-23 11:08:00	relsqui	there is just nothing here for someone who doesn't like being marketed at 
2014-07-23 11:08:19	 *	relsqui tired, grumpy, wasting time 
2014-07-23 11:08:39	<--	sabreman_work (~ultra_sab@193.18.92.162) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-07-23 11:12:06	askore	relsqui: yeah, unfortunately... it's good for being marketed at, talking to recruiters, and otherwise doing networking stuff
2014-07-23 11:12:28	@bajr	s/me points to topic for all the questioning masses
2014-07-23 11:14:29	@bajr	i'm hoping to be ready by then
2014-07-23 11:14:49	askore	bajr: I have some computer parts coming today so I might skip to play with those >.>
2014-07-23 11:15:12	stacybird	relsqui: are you here?
2014-07-23 11:15:15	stacybird	its true
2014-07-23 11:15:20	stacybird	expo only is marketing only
2014-07-23 11:15:29	stacybird	there is swag
2014-07-23 11:15:32	stacybird	schwag?
2014-07-23 11:15:46	askore	swag?
2014-07-23 11:15:53	askore	well the swag this year is kinda meh imo
2014-07-23 11:15:58	askore	there were some really good shirts last year
2014-07-23 11:15:58	stacybird	but aside from that and trading your contact details for things, I think the thing I like about oscon is stalking speakers.  :P
2014-07-23 11:16:04	askore	lol
2014-07-23 11:16:12	stacybird	I mean you can walk up to people and be like, hey I like your work, lets talk
2014-07-23 11:16:33	stacybird	the other neat side-effect
2014-07-23 11:16:37	askore	and some people do get sent by their companies to be marketed to
2014-07-23 11:16:43	stacybird	is you get people ready to hack sometimes
2014-07-23 11:16:47	askore	yeah
2014-07-23 11:17:06	stacybird	so you can get a result from in-person time with a community which otherwise would never meet
2014-07-23 11:17:16	stacybird	*shrug*
2014-07-23 11:17:20	askore	yeah
2014-07-23 11:17:23	stacybird	but yeah
2014-07-23 11:17:29	askore	I got a free cookbook last year
2014-07-23 11:17:32	askore	pretty cool
2014-07-23 11:17:32	stacybird	the marketing to audience are businesses here
2014-07-23 11:17:46	stacybird	osbridge does a better job of community making community for community
2014-07-23 11:17:52	stacybird	thus the osb shirt today.  :P
2014-07-23 11:18:03	 *	stacybird as citizen volunteer
2014-07-23 11:18:13	tamgc	other benefit, free beer and booze
2014-07-23 11:18:19	stacybird	askore: cookbook for food or tech?  :D
2014-07-23 11:18:27	stacybird	well yeah
2014-07-23 11:18:32	askore	stacybird: a nerdy food-cookbook
2014-07-23 11:18:37	stacybird	if you just want to party/food/talk to ppl you can do that too
2014-07-23 11:18:41	stacybird	LOL
2014-07-23 11:18:41	askore	about doing science on food
2014-07-23 11:18:44	stacybird	askore++
2014-07-23 11:18:51	stacybird	food is science
2014-07-23 11:19:01	stacybird	see baking == chemistry
2014-07-23 11:23:51	@bajr	askore: dom Pash: and other potential derpsers, let's just do next week
2014-07-23 11:24:04	askore	aye-aye
2014-07-23 11:24:19	--	bajr has changed topic for #tabletop from "bajr's GURPS dir: http://goo.gl/8Sswfd | Get a roll20.net account | Next derps game: 2014-07-23 18:00 CAT Conf?" to "bajr's GURPS dir: http://goo.gl/8Sswfd | Get a roll20.net account | Next derps game: 2014-07-30 CAT Conf"
2014-07-23 11:24:31	@bajr	Start thinking of character concepts
2014-07-23 11:24:40	@bajr	sabreman: ^^
2014-07-23 11:26:26	askore	bajr: remind us what genre these character concepts should be in?
2014-07-23 11:30:02	@bajr	low-magic fantasy genre. humans only
2014-07-23 11:30:19	Fetter	bajr, what system is it? where is the game held?
2014-07-23 11:30:26	@bajr	basic premise is humanity lives exclusively underground in a vast cave network
2014-07-23 11:30:43	@bajr	Fetter: gurps-lite with a bit of modification
2014-07-23 11:31:11	Fetter	we only need to  know concept? or do we need to have a full char sheet filled out?
2014-07-23 11:31:25	@bajr	only concept for now
2014-07-23 11:31:52	Fetter	does low-magic mean low magic item or low magic ability altogether, thus mages/clerics/druid types are much weaker?
2014-07-23 11:32:21	@bajr	low-magic ability. those who have it are powerful, but it's not a common thing
2014-07-23 11:32:35	relsqui	stacybird: I just left 
2014-07-23 11:33:22	relsqui	askore: that was kind of what I expected, but people seemed so confused/surprised I wasn't excited about it that I thought I might be missing something 
2014-07-23 11:33:24	Fetter	what era would this low-magic fantasy world be closest?
2014-07-23 11:34:17	tamgc	relsqui: no, you must have same enthusiasm levels as all other people -.-
2014-07-23 11:34:24	relsqui	lol
2014-07-23 11:34:36	askore	relsqui: yeah mostly there's power + free lunch and occasionally I bother to go to talks
2014-07-23 11:34:45	Fetter	medieval or renaissance?
2014-07-23 11:34:46	askore	plus a bunch of people I know are hanging around
2014-07-23 11:35:19	relsqui	I think also people forget that, like, I don't want one of those tech jobs. and a lot of the culture grosses me out 
2014-07-23 11:36:12	@bajr	Fetter: approximately Late middle ages
2014-07-23 11:36:26	@bajr	right before rennaissance
2014-07-23 11:36:27	relsqui	but also see above re tired and grumpy 
2014-07-23 11:36:33	@bajr	*renaissance
2014-07-23 11:36:48	askore	yup, I absolutely would not give someone a hard time for not liking oscon
2014-07-23 11:37:02	askore	it's kind of osbridge's bigger, sketchier sibling
2014-07-23 11:37:13	Fetter	what is the economic, government, religious systems like?  normal for that period or some interesting difference?
2014-07-23 11:37:20	tamgc	relsqui: yeah, the value of oscon diminishes quickly if you don't have the session access to potentially interesting talks
2014-07-23 11:37:22	relsqui	lol
2014-07-23 11:37:30	askore	Fetter: aside from the fact that everyone lives underground?
2014-07-23 11:37:36	Fetter	right
2014-07-23 11:38:01	relsqui	I like osbridge because it feels more about people than companies 
2014-07-23 11:38:12	askore	for sure
2014-07-23 11:38:24	Fetter	is it like an apocalyptic scenario where there is some community, but mostly chaos and a struggle to survive with pretty much no economic system besides trade or is there some additional structure that has been built?
2014-07-23 11:39:19	@bajr	Fetter: yep, everyone lives underground, so they've adjusted accordingly. There are 5 nations with touchy relations. There is structure. Religious systems are prominant and available but not 'enforced' to persecution anymore
2014-07-23 11:40:03	@bajr	oh yeah, and the party starts out as a small caravan of merchants
2014-07-23 11:40:34	@bajr	but don't let that guide your character dev
2014-07-23 11:40:55	 *	askore imagines Dwarf Fortress-style complicated man powered elevator systems for vertical travel
2014-07-23 11:41:05	Fetter	is there just one type of magic system or is there mage, psionics, clerical differences in how it works?
2014-07-23 11:41:16	@bajr	just one type of magic system
2014-07-23 11:41:41	@bajr	which I still have to summarize for gurps purposes
2014-07-23 11:41:42	Fetter	is it like a psionics or are material components or ritual of some type required for use?
2014-07-23 11:42:50	@bajr	likely material and ritual
2014-07-23 11:43:08	Fetter	is multi-classing allowed?
2014-07-23 11:43:37	 *	askore has a basic character idea :D now to flesh it out
2014-07-23 11:44:03	@bajr	gurps doesn't have classes, so absolutely
2014-07-23 11:44:04	Fetter	is the entire party from the same nation or are they from different regions?
2014-07-23 11:44:19	askore	mmmm it smells like lunch
2014-07-23 11:44:35	@bajr	same nation
2014-07-23 11:44:39	askore	the fire nation?
2014-07-23 11:44:41	askore	:P
2014-07-23 11:44:44	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-23 11:44:50	Fetter	i hope so
2014-07-23 11:45:01	@bajr	you all hail from a nation called Karsteros
2014-07-23 11:45:06	@bajr	:)
2014-07-23 11:45:20	stacybird	bajr: other than reading backscroll what can I do to get up to speed?
2014-07-23 11:45:30	 *	stacybird has never gurpssed
2014-07-23 11:45:42	stacybird	if that can be a word
2014-07-23 11:45:46	@bajr	stacybird: I'll post a world summary later tonight with all the things you'll need to know
2014-07-23 11:45:47	stacybird	omg
2014-07-23 11:45:47	Fetter	i have only played D&D/AD&D, White Wolf and Chaosism BRP/CoC systems
2014-07-23 11:45:52	stacybird	github.com/nasa
2014-07-23 11:45:54	Fetter	so, forgive my lack of Gurps
2014-07-23 11:45:55	stacybird	lol
2014-07-23 11:46:01	@bajr	Fetter: no worries
2014-07-23 11:46:04	Fetter	but, i'm sure i can catch up
2014-07-23 11:46:24	@bajr	my intention here is to abstract the gurps rules from you guys as far as possible so you can focus on role-playing instead of numbers
2014-07-23 11:46:56	@bajr	because gurps left unchecked is a deep, dark rabbit-hole of little details
2014-07-23 11:47:05	Fetter	i am published though: http://www.chaosium.com/halloween-horror-returns/
2014-07-23 11:47:17	tamgc	is one of the nations artstotzka? =)
2014-07-23 11:47:31	Fetter	just once though...i never had a chance to finish my second 
2014-07-23 11:47:32	@bajr	glory to arstotzka!
2014-07-23 11:47:50	Fetter	that sounds cool
2014-07-23 11:48:00	@bajr	Fetter: ifyou're interested check out the 4th ed GURPS Basic Set in my homedir link up above

2014-07-24 10:29:35	askore	thats an all day thing tho
2014-07-24 10:33:10	Fetter	out of curiosity, are people also interested in games like munchkins or netrunner, etc for table top gaming fun?
2014-07-24 10:34:36	dom	Fetter: yeah, for the most part. Most people in here are down as long as they have the time :P
2014-07-24 10:35:42	Fetter	p.s. gardening is great!  i just noticed the gardening commentary...i have mostly fruits...blueberries, pears, apples, shiro plum, grapes, strawberries, huckleberries, elderberries, figs, etc...i like my fruits!
2014-07-24 10:36:00	Fetter	yeah, time can be a dilemma, hence the shorter type games like munchkins
2014-07-24 10:36:39	dom	yeah, even then heh
2014-07-24 10:36:42	Fetter	i could bring some of my munchkin games into the office and there could be a short 30-60 min sessions here and there
2014-07-24 10:36:50	Fetter	that's why i was asking
2014-07-24 10:37:07	Fetter	i have lot's of the short time spanned type card or dice games for the reason of lack of time
2014-07-24 10:37:22	Fetter	though, true role-playing gaming goodness is best
2014-07-24 10:37:23	dom	yeah I gotcha
2014-07-24 10:37:40	Fetter	it's just too much time
2014-07-24 10:37:50	dom	I'd be down to play during the day, but I'm busy today and tomorrow
2014-07-24 10:37:53	Fetter	one gaming session is about all to squeeze in
2014-07-24 10:38:02	dom	I bet a lot of people here are at oscon right now too
2014-07-24 10:38:04	Fetter	yeah, i'm just asking for future planning
2014-07-24 10:38:10	dom	yeah I gotcha
2014-07-24 10:38:15	Fetter	well, hopefully they scroll back
2014-07-24 10:38:19	dom	:P
2014-07-24 10:39:06	Fetter	at some point, i intend to run a more lengthy campaign...i like epic campaigns with lot's of character building
2014-07-24 10:39:14	dom	yap
2014-07-24 10:39:22	dom	s/yap/yup/
2014-07-24 10:39:22	Fetter	but, it takes time to setup everything so it's sweet
2014-07-24 10:39:58	Fetter	the last epic campaign i ran was probably 5 years ago and it was a 3 year long campaign with a good solid core group
2014-07-24 10:40:31	Fetter	where the game sessions were once every two weeks on average
2014-07-24 10:40:41	dom	awesome :P
2014-07-24 10:40:48	Fetter	i wrote a story out of it
2014-07-24 10:41:02	dom	those are the best games
2014-07-24 10:41:08	Fetter	i had summary short stories out of each campaign session that i sent out the players
2014-07-24 10:41:28	Fetter	it was fun
2014-07-24 10:41:45	@bajr	morning citizens
2014-07-24 10:41:51	dom	morning bajr
2014-07-24 10:41:59	Fetter	greetings
2014-07-24 10:43:45	Fetter	did you get my emails, bajr?
2014-07-24 10:43:50	@bajr	yes
2014-07-24 10:43:58	@bajr	I will review them later today/tonight
2014-07-24 10:44:06	Fetter	i sent them from my personal email...i like to separate my personal from work emails
2014-07-24 10:46:26	Fetter	back on the gardening subject, one day i hope to make elderberry wine
2014-07-24 10:46:41	Fetter	the plants are too small yet to get enough berries to do so
2014-07-24 10:46:45	Fetter	but they're growing nice
2014-07-24 10:46:59	Fetter	i could probably make one whole bottle of wine out of what is there now
2014-07-24 10:57:16	askore	Fetter: huh, nice
2014-07-24 10:57:52	askore	my parents used to make apple wine
2014-07-24 10:58:29	askore	(they had a teeny tiny winery, but they just made it all in the back yard and aged it in the barn)
2014-07-24 11:00:16	Fetter	interesting...one of my other dilemmas is where to do it, i need to get a new shed at some point, maybe i can get a slightly larger one and set it up with some portion for the winery? 
2014-07-24 11:00:52	Fetter	i thought i would end up making cider with the apples and pear wine
2014-07-24 11:01:44	Fetter	i have three pear trees, two apple trees, seven grape vines and two elderberries
2014-07-24 11:01:55	askore	ah nice
2014-07-24 11:02:03	Fetter	the crops i am getting this year are getting kind of crazy
2014-07-24 11:02:20	Fetter	so, next year, i will definitely have plenty to do something awesome with
2014-07-24 11:02:30	askore	could make some nice jams and such 
2014-07-24 11:02:37	Fetter	i have 17 blueberry bushes too
2014-07-24 11:02:41	Fetter	i like blueberries
2014-07-24 11:03:29	Fetter	yeah, i need to figure that all out...though, i don't really use jam much personally
2014-07-24 11:03:34	askore	true
2014-07-24 11:03:51	Fetter	i like to freeze blueberries and eat them like candy out of the freezer
2014-07-24 11:03:52	askore	blueberries are good frozen, and some freezer jams make good ice cream toppping
2014-07-24 11:03:56	Fetter	lol
2014-07-24 11:04:04	Fetter	yeah, that
2014-07-24 11:07:37	Fetter	blueberry candies are good in the summer too...especially when they're practically free
2014-07-24 11:08:08	Fetter	i have been easily getting $20-30 worth of blueberries everyday off of my bushes for several weeks now
2014-07-24 11:08:20	Fetter	according to how much they cost in the stores
2014-07-24 11:08:24	Fetter	cause, yikes!
2014-07-24 11:09:03	askore	you could probably successfully sell that to frienda
2014-07-24 11:09:06	askore	friends*
2014-07-24 11:09:17	askore	or lightly processed things like fruit leather
2014-07-24 11:10:14	Fetter	yeah, i can setup a booth out in front of my house and have fresh squeezed apple juice with little bags of fruit for sale  ;-)
2014-07-24 11:10:25	askore	yum yum
2014-07-24 11:10:32	Fetter	of course, i'll be drinking cider
2014-07-24 11:10:33	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-24 11:11:58	Fetter	i just typically let the neighborhood peeps (usually those with kids, so they kids can get some good fruit) come snag whatever leftover plums, pears and apples i have...
2014-07-24 11:12:07	Fetter	those are the things i have too much of to handle
2014-07-24 11:21:49	stacybird	askore: here
2014-07-24 11:22:12	stacybird	hm time is slow srry

2014-07-24 11:33:26	tamgc	Fetter: just set up winery things under the tiles in your office =)
2014-07-24 11:34:46	Fetter	i wouldn't want the rats or zombies to get to my wine
2014-07-24 11:34:54	tamgc	adds flavor
2014-07-24 11:44:59	stacybird	LOL
2014-07-24 11:48:10	Fetter	man, if the zombie apocalypse ever does happen, i'm gonna be like that guy in zombieland, except instead of looking for twinkies, i will be looking for wine
2014-07-24 11:48:33	Fetter	and there better not be any rats near it either!
2014-07-24 11:48:48	Fetter	or worse...zombie rats!!!
2014-07-24 11:49:11	Fetter	so, not into zombie rats...
2014-07-24 11:55:48	tamgc	pshaw, not like rats have ever helped spread diseases in the past
2014-07-24 11:56:41	Fetter	well, i actually don't like mosquitos more and they're worse with spreading diseases...
2014-07-24 11:57:30	tamgc	zombie mosquitos, sound nice and friendly
2014-07-24 12:01:25	Fetter	yes...i'm sure some sort of zombie mosquito bug-like thing can become a new creature in some variant swarm size in a campaign
2014-07-24 12:01:31	Fetter	those are the best
2014-07-24 12:01:35	Fetter	lol

2014-07-26 13:20:06	relsqui	(bread)
2014-07-26 13:20:09	@bajr	huh
2014-07-26 13:22:13	relsqui	traditional for jewish sabbath but tasty at all times
2014-07-26 13:22:42	relsqui	(also, apparently, it and related things are traditional in a bunch of other cultures, but I dunno anything about those)
2014-07-26 13:26:46	askore	D: there was a beetle on my bath towel
2014-07-26 13:27:50	relsqui	had it been taking a bath?
2014-07-26 13:28:34	askore	a rather cotton-y bath
2014-07-26 13:28:45	askore	it was small as round black beetles go, but large as bugs that are in my house go.
2014-07-26 13:28:54	relsqui	heh :)

2014-07-26 14:36:02	 *	askore cranks music, opens energy drink, starts to bake
2014-07-26 14:36:15	askore	I'd better read the instructions WAY more carefully than I do with cooking recipes
2014-07-26 14:39:19	relsqui	haha
2014-07-26 14:39:27	relsqui	unless you're an experienced bread baker! in which case you probably don't have to
2014-07-26 14:40:33	relsqui	relatedly, I could have sworn I bought bagels last night but can't find them :( must have left them at the store when I was bagging
2014-07-26 14:40:36	relsqui	disappointing
2014-07-26 14:40:59	askore	;(
2014-07-26 14:43:35	 *	relsqui eats chips and hummus for breakfast instead
2014-07-26 15:06:57	askore	phew
2014-07-26 15:07:03	askore	after much angst, it's on the rise
2014-07-26 15:07:19	 *	askore is not experienced at kneading dough and was not quite prepared for the volume o.o
2014-07-26 15:07:51	askore	I don't think I over-kneaded it, but I'm not sure how I would tell if I didn't knead it enough
2014-07-26 15:24:52	mancat	twf you jump in the shower and soak down only to find your soap mia :(
2014-07-26 15:26:49	relsqui	:(
2014-07-26 15:29:22	askore	free excuse to take two showers in one day
2014-07-26 15:49:53	mancat	askore: is that a thing you < want to do | need an excuse for >?
2014-07-26 15:50:22	relsqui	I have sometimes appreciated in the winter that I am socially expected to shower every or most days, because it gives me an excuse to stand in a box of warm water for a while
2014-07-26 16:01:40	askore	yeah mostly that ^
2014-07-26 16:01:55	askore	and taking a warm shower before bed is good because body temperature dropping -> go to sleep
2014-07-26 16:02:19	relsqui	today in "you would think this headline isn't what it sounds like, but it is" http://www.iflscience.com/space/russia-loses-control-gecko-sex-satellite
2014-07-26 16:03:44	askore	ok time to interact with the dough again
2014-07-26 16:04:34	jesusaurus	what are you making?
2014-07-26 16:09:31	askore	challah! http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/09/best-challah-egg-bread/

2014-07-26 16:09:42	askore	lol
2014-07-26 16:09:43	nibalizer	do et nowwwwwww
2014-07-26 16:09:49	askore	nibalizer: it's still doing bread stuff
2014-07-26 16:09:59	askore	I had to take it out and squish it and now it's resting again
2014-07-26 16:10:05	askore	so it'll be done "eventually"
2014-07-26 16:10:17	nibalizer	feeeeeed meeeeeee
2014-07-26 16:10:28	askore	I'll tell you when it's done and you can have some, but it's not done yet
2014-07-26 16:10:36	nibalizer	okay
2014-07-26 16:10:37	nibalizer	excellent
2014-07-26 16:10:41	relsqui	XD
2014-07-26 16:10:46	relsqui	"all is going according to plan"
2014-07-26 16:13:01	relsqui	askore: I only just saw your earlier line about this, but aiui "not kneaded enough" looks like if you pull it apart it just breaks instead of stretchin
2014-07-26 16:13:04	relsqui	g
2014-07-26 16:13:13	relsqui	s/breaks/comes apart/
2014-07-26 16:13:15	relsqui	not, like, snaps
2014-07-26 16:13:38	relsqui	because it's the long glutenous protein things that you're encouraging
2014-07-26 16:14:20	askore	hmmmm
2014-07-26 16:14:23	askore	well, I think it's fine
2014-07-26 16:16:31	relsqui	probably :) bread is more forgiving than people give it credit for
2014-07-26 16:16:43	relsqui	short of leaving it in the oven an hour too long you're unlikely to wind up with something not tasty
2014-07-26 16:17:46	nibalizer	mmm gluten
2014-07-26 16:17:48	nibalizer	mmm braed
2014-07-26 16:23:48	askore	lol
2014-07-26 16:26:57	relsqui	agh keep getting sidetracked by geek feminism wiki
2014-07-26 16:27:10	relsqui	was originally just looking for notes/suggestions for a CoC for catcamp
2014-07-26 16:36:12	jesusaurus	haha
2014-07-26 17:18:25	askore	*sigh*
2014-07-26 17:18:34	askore	braiding 6 things is HARD
2014-07-26 17:18:54	 *	askore gave up and it's probably going to look funky but will hopefully taste good
2014-07-26 17:19:02	nibalizer	yes
2014-07-26 17:19:08	nibalizer	i think you need a nibz opinion on tasting good
2014-07-26 17:19:10	nibalizer	so yea
2014-07-26 17:19:13	nibalizer	plz 2 provide
2014-07-26 17:19:14	askore	lol
2014-07-26 17:19:18	askore	nibalizer: I don't deliver
2014-07-26 17:19:26	nibalizer	uh
2014-07-26 17:19:32	nibalizer	think of it as comming over to hang out
2014-07-26 17:19:36	nibalizer	and also there is bread
2014-07-26 17:19:38	askore	lol
2014-07-26 17:19:48	askore	I can't think of a single good way of taking this on the bus
2014-07-26 17:19:50	askore	:P
2014-07-26 17:35:50	relsqui	<_< in a bag?
2014-07-26 17:35:55	relsqui	askore: I always braid it in threes
2014-07-26 17:35:58	relsqui	because I am amateur
2014-07-26 17:36:00	relsqui	:P
2014-07-26 17:40:28	nebrith	oh god such awkward conversations at work between calls today
2014-07-26 17:40:43	askore	relsqui: a plastic bag? I have paper bags, and like cloth shopping bags, but...
2014-07-26 17:40:43	jesusaurus	also, you can twist 'em together first so that you are braiding 3 helices
2014-07-26 17:40:53	askore	oh that would have been smart jesusaurus >.>
2014-07-26 17:41:03	 *	jesusaurus is a thinker
2014-07-26 17:44:24	askore	nibalizer: how about hang out at blkperl's house tomorrow and you can have bread then?
2014-07-26 17:48:31	nibalizer	i dont think thats in the cards
2014-07-26 17:57:31	nebrith	does anyone wanna have a party? :3
2014-07-26 18:00:04	Fox	partiiiiies
2014-07-26 18:00:19	Fox	Probably not, given I'm running a Pathfinder game tomorrow and should be sleeping...
2014-07-26 18:26:33	askore	hrmmm maybe I should have made on really big loaf instead of two smaller ones
2014-07-26 18:26:39	askore	because they're totally going to squish together during baking
2014-07-26 18:26:44	askore	s/on/one/
2014-07-26 18:31:19	tamgc	it's just 1 really big one that breaks apart easily at that point heh
2014-07-26 18:33:09	askore	lol
2014-07-26 18:33:11	askore	yeah
2014-07-26 18:33:22	askore	wow it puffed up super big
2014-07-26 18:49:01	tamgc	o.O so you've got a super big bread that breaks up into big bread now \o/ ?
2014-07-26 18:54:09	askore	hmmmmmm
2014-07-26 18:54:19	 *	askore noms, ponders
2014-07-26 18:55:16	askore	yes, I think this is too much flour/too much kneading. It's tougher than anticipated
2014-07-26 18:55:19	askore	good flavor though
2014-07-26 18:57:34	 *	bajr yawns
2014-07-26 19:21:06	 *	askore :(
2014-07-26 19:21:17	askore	my computer can't install its graphics driver

2014-07-26 19:39:25	askore	ah, or it did work after all
2014-07-26 19:39:32	askore	but minecraft still crashes
2014-07-26 19:40:01	nightfly	minecraft or minecraft + tons of mods? :)
2014-07-26 19:40:05	askore	the second one
2014-07-26 19:47:13	dom	the good one
2014-07-26 19:51:17	 *	nightfly needs to play Don't Starve some more
2014-07-26 19:56:13	nightfly	I'm kind of biased against modded minecraft, not entirely sure why. Maybe because it's only kinda-sorta approved, and the first party support of it is strange.
2014-07-26 19:56:35	relsqui	nightfly: it just makes it too complicated for me
2014-07-26 19:56:39	relsqui	the base game is already p. complicated
2014-07-26 19:58:16	dom	nightfly: its approved by mojang, but theres lots of weird gray spots
2014-07-26 19:58:30	dom	for example, when crash code in mods interacting was a thing
2014-07-26 19:58:52	dom	"Im X mod and you have Y mod installed too?! Guess you didn't wanna play minecraft, im force crashing now!"
2014-07-26 20:33:23	@bajr	nightfly: don't starve is pretty fun
2014-07-26 20:33:26	@bajr	hard as hell though
2014-07-26 20:34:54	@bajr	i still haven't beaten it, and I've logged about 90 hours on it >.>
2014-07-26 20:43:24	 *	bajr begins character sheeting
2014-07-26 20:52:33	askore	I wish I had two monitors...
2014-07-26 20:52:43	askore	so I could watch movies and play games at the same time
2014-07-26 20:53:29	dom	buy another one
2014-07-26 20:54:54	askore	uhhh
2014-07-26 20:55:02	askore	I'm not actually sure my video card can do it
2014-07-26 20:55:06	dom	:(
2014-07-26 20:55:11	nightfly	you have laptop XP
2014-07-26 20:55:20	askore	it has one yellow port and one white port and I'm not sure if they're the same thing
2014-07-26 20:55:44	askore	nightfly: but my laptop screen is much smaller, hooking it up to the speakers involves crawling under the desk, and doesn't have all my movies on it
2014-07-26 20:55:48	askore	and that includes netflix
2014-07-26 20:55:56	askore	(unless netflix runs in wine these days)
2014-07-26 20:56:36	nightfly	The "Netflix Desktop" thing works decent
2014-07-26 20:56:41	askore	for arch?
2014-07-26 20:57:03	nightfly	Dunno, I've got it going on Fedora though
2014-07-26 20:57:17	nightfly	I think it's in the AUR
2014-07-26 20:57:22	askore	mmk
2014-07-26 20:58:08	nightfly	It comes with it's own firefox that it runs in though, and you /have/ to disable automatic updates in it.
2014-07-26 20:58:56	askore	in any case, the other reasons remain
2014-07-26 21:04:06	nibalizer	nightfly: you running the wordmapper in silverlight in netflix-desktop was some pimp shit
2014-07-26 21:11:53	jesusaurus	yeah netflix-desktop works well on both ubuntu and gentoo, i would be surprised if it didnt work on arch
2014-07-26 22:28:42	askore	haha
2014-07-26 22:29:03	askore	from tumblr: 
2014-07-26 22:29:05	askore	So we have WoW’s next expansion, Warlords of Draenor, which is an expansion about a world inhabited by various Mongolian-inspired clans of orcs, bird and cat people, and involves time-travel.
2014-07-26 22:29:07	askore	Then we have MtG’s next block, Khans of Tarkir, which is a block about a world inhabited by various Mongolian-inspired clans of orcs, bird and cat people, and involves time-travel.

2014-07-26 23:46:51	askore	hmmmmm

2014-07-26 23:52:43	dom	or brown sugar, or syrup even
2014-07-26 23:52:53	dom	it was really just bread soaked in egg and then fried
2014-07-26 23:53:44	dom	but it tasted good!

2014-07-26 23:54:37	askore	which is much the same but also includes a coating of sugar
2014-07-26 23:54:42	dom	nice
2014-07-26 23:54:54	dom	oh man I tried to make french toast before in 40 below

2014-07-26 23:55:26	askore	bleh
2014-07-26 23:55:43	dom	I mean it was the last day of a campout and we all wanted to leave :P

2014-07-26 23:56:12	askore	at the end "look you knew what to expect"
2014-07-26 23:56:42	dom	well it was more like "this is warmer than your fingers right now guaranteed"
2014-07-26 23:56:56	 *	askore needs to take care of the cast iron pan, and freeze up some sausage slices
2014-07-26 23:57:00	dom	and yeah, everyone knew what was going down
2014-07-26 23:57:04	askore	so much kitchen things to so
2014-07-26 23:57:06	dom	heh
2014-07-26 23:57:23	dom	I wish I lived in a place where I could just cook using a dutch oven >>

2014-07-27 00:03:21	dom	I think maybe you just mean its a different sensation than most objects
2014-07-27 00:03:27	askore	mmmmmm
2014-07-27 00:03:29	dom	which can feel ticklish, I guess
2014-07-27 00:03:57	askore	maybe you dont get the same feeling I do from pet noses/tongues
2014-07-27 00:04:02	dom	it engages your nerve endings and makes you smile, I guess thats tickling

2014-07-27 01:28:41	mancat	it's interesting to watch the slow progression of american cinema towards something like technical savvy
2014-07-27 01:29:15	 *	mancat watched hackers when he was too young to know much besides that that's *probably* not how things actually worked
2014-07-27 01:29:40	mancat	i was very excite in the theater watching The Matrix that at the beginning of the movie, neo had a command line open
2014-07-27 01:29:48	mancat	he was running nmap, wasn't he?
2014-07-27 01:30:20	 *	mancat just finished watching the first season of Revolution, where people actually run /usr/bin/ksh (for some reason)
2014-07-27 01:30:57	mancat	and yet, when the laws of nature return to the job after a 15 year lunch break and electricity starts working again, every city in the US immediately has power to its residences
2014-07-27 01:31:10	mancat	never mind that every power station has been abandoned for years

2014-07-27 08:26:51	relsqui	aww
2014-07-27 08:27:09	askore	(this wouldn't be a problem if I just bought a toaster)
2014-07-27 08:27:29	relsqui	could be worse, I managed to buy bagels at the store the other night and, as far as I can tell, leave them there when I was bagging other groceries
2014-07-27 08:27:35	askore	;(
2014-07-27 08:27:37	relsqui	I just know I woke up the next morning and enobagels

2014-07-27 12:14:41	 *	mancat would just cut the mold dot off and eat that one before the rest of the spores started growing
2014-07-27 12:14:54	mancat	but then, mancats were always filthy creatures
2014-07-27 14:31:48	askore	mancat: that's basically what I did, I just put them in separate bags for extra safety
2014-07-27 14:31:57	askore	(I have an extreme excess of sandwich bags for some reason)

2014-07-27 17:47:58	tamgc	thing about mold, is it's not always the visible ones that's the issue, it might cause some, but there are invisible ones that can wreck you a bit
2014-07-27 17:53:31	askore	yeah I'm not really worried, so I didn't throw it out
2014-07-27 17:54:57	tamgc	yeah I think it's usually one or the other anyways
2014-07-27 17:55:11	tamgc	plus the whole conan thing, what does not kill you...
2014-07-27 17:55:57	askore	yup

2014-07-28 10:43:33	askore	I just typed the entire tar extract command without consciously thinking about it
2014-07-28 10:43:44	askore	usually I have to pause to think if there's a dash or not, at least
2014-07-28 10:49:10	Takua	She has found The Zone

2014-07-28 10:50:37	askore	I also typed cd blahblah without realizing I specifically typed cd - I think I meant to type ls, but didn't
2014-07-28 10:50:41	askore	cd turned out to be more useful

2014-07-28 11:29:11	Takua	Uh
2014-07-28 11:29:45	Takua	I...CAN...I think.  They start in October, right?
2014-07-28 11:31:43	relsqui	they do, although I'm shooting to start meetings maybe mid-august
2014-07-28 11:31:59	relsqui	people who can't start committing time until later I can still use but will probably have as helpers rather than session leaders
2014-07-28 11:32:37	Takua	Mm.  Okay.  I have two trips I need to make to Phoenix and one back to Ohio (but the Ohio trip is for a weekend)

2014-07-28 11:37:04	Fox	It's too bad you don't get points for attaining it multiple times...
2014-07-28 11:40:23	relsqui	or even once, in fact
2014-07-28 11:40:37	relsqui	Takua: generally being able to do it but having to miss a couple is also fine
2014-07-28 11:40:50	relsqui	Takua: anyway get in #mentors and do the doodle :) for help plannings
2014-07-28 11:47:10	Fox	One of my players is teh sads right now.
2014-07-28 11:47:37	Fox	In a very general sense, he encountered his nemesis and was slain by him.
2014-07-28 11:48:10	Fox	The rest of the player characters managed to retrieve his body and found the clergy, but none were powerful enough to actually raise the dead.
2014-07-28 11:48:25	Fox	However, they did know druids, who could bring him back to life through reincarnation.
2014-07-28 11:48:42	Fox	It was ultimately out of his hands, and he wasn't happy with the form he came back with.
2014-07-28 11:49:01	Fox	Thus, he's getting over the "tampering with his brain-baby".
2014-07-28 11:49:02	Fox	:(
2014-07-28 11:49:12	relsqui	:(
2014-07-28 11:49:18	Takua	relsqui: Okay.  Gimme a bit...first day back to work and we have an event
2014-07-28 11:49:23	relsqui	Takua: yeah for sure.
2014-07-28 11:49:36	relsqui	Takua: I've just been waiting to bug you about that for, like, weeks, so I wanted to get it out of my system <_<
2014-07-28 11:50:28	Fox	I always forget this channel isn't for discussing tabletop games...
2014-07-28 11:51:18	Takua	Hehehe
2014-07-28 11:51:27	Takua	No problem with that
2014-07-28 11:52:20	Takua	And pffft, what?  #tabletop isn't for tabletop games?  MADNESS.
2014-07-28 11:52:44	relsqui	Fox: it is, just ont only
2014-07-28 11:53:30	Fox	Maybe I just don't pop in here when that conversation is happening.
2014-07-28 11:53:33	Fox	<_<;
2014-07-28 12:13:30	tamgc	Fox: you just need to be on IRC all the time
2014-07-28 12:13:47	tamgc	also sucks for the guy, but...happens...
2014-07-28 12:14:30	tamgc	if said brain-baby is min-max'd char though, I'd have 0 sympathy -.-
2014-07-28 12:18:27	Fox	I have one player who's a min-maxer, and it's not this one
2014-07-28 12:18:44	Fox	Actually, his new body granted him higher physical ability scores in every category
2014-07-28 12:18:57	Fox	He's upset because his mental image is, well, no longer accurate.
2014-07-28 12:20:22	@bajr	rawr
2014-07-28 12:20:31	Takua	rawr

2014-07-28 18:57:57	askore	nebrith: it sounds like you should give the bajr a character profile and show up on wednesday.... >.>
2014-07-28 18:58:40	nebrith	askore: Wednesdays are a thingie?
2014-07-28 18:58:45	nebrith	I've been so out of hte looooop

2014-07-28 19:16:23	 *	relsqui wiggles nose
2014-07-28 19:16:30	relsqui	I just put a retainer in my septum (I mean, my piercer did) and it feels weird
2014-07-28 19:17:02	nebrith	Ooh that sounds interesting.
2014-07-28 19:17:08	 *	bajr retains his septum
2014-07-28 19:17:16	nebrith	relsqui: when you got pierced the first time was it a rush?
2014-07-28 19:17:34	nebrith	Or is the "OMG DO IT MORE THAT FELT SUPER COOL" rush just my poor wiring?
2014-07-28 19:18:15	relsqui	nebrith: I think everyone gets that
2014-07-28 19:18:26	relsqui	to varying degrees
2014-07-28 19:19:21	nebrith	really?
2014-07-28 19:19:25	nebrith	Yay
2014-07-28 19:19:36	nebrith	One less thing to obsess over. I wanna get my ears pierced again/more.
2014-07-28 19:20:39	 *	relsqui nods
2014-07-28 19:20:53	relsqui	I've been nudging pash about going with me some time, not that either of us has any money, lol
2014-07-28 19:21:00	relsqui	I've been talking to my piercer about getting shorter lip bars made
2014-07-28 19:21:13	relsqui	because the ones I'm wearing are the smallest they stock and they're still a little too long for me
2014-07-28 19:21:16	relsqui	they stick out a bit
2014-07-28 19:21:54	relsqui	I talked to him about it today; he checked with the company and they can do it, and it wouldn't be too much more expensive than the original jewelry
2014-07-28 19:21:57	relsqui	but that's still really expensive :/
2014-07-28 19:24:03	relsqui	like $100
2014-07-28 19:26:19	askore	uuuuuu uhura is so cute
2014-07-28 19:27:10	nebrith	uuuuu
2014-07-28 19:27:18	nebrith	Pepper spit a bug into my open mouth today.
2014-07-28 19:27:20	nebrith	It was alive!
2014-07-28 19:27:27	nebrith	He was so proud of himself.
2014-07-28 19:27:56	askore	eugh
2014-07-28 19:28:24	askore	I found a beetle in my bath towel the other day, luckily before I wrapped it around myself
2014-07-28 19:28:31	askore	it was dead though, and pretty small
2014-07-28 19:31:47	nebrith	This was an assassin bug 
2014-07-28 19:31:51	nebrith	It tasted HORRIBLE
2014-07-28 19:32:53	nebrith	Pepper was like "WHY U REJECT MAH GIFT I LOVE U"
2014-07-28 19:34:42	@bajr	o.o
2014-07-28 19:40:24	nebrith	yeah he just kinda spit it at me
2014-07-28 21:23:27	askore	what a cute kitty....

2014-07-30 06:53:31	tamgc	(cop car at start of curvy part)
2014-07-30 07:46:18	tamgc	heh apparently a tree fell down...
2014-07-30 08:05:05	askore	orly?
2014-07-30 08:05:27	askore	tamgc++ out-hipstering bkero
2014-07-30 08:09:49	tamgc	o.O wait, wha?
2014-07-30 08:10:27	tamgc	oh right heh
2014-07-30 08:10:47	 *	tamgc just prefer less crowded places -.-
2014-07-30 08:11:02	askore	yeah 
2014-07-30 08:11:04	askore	lol
2014-07-30 08:12:50	tamgc	i'd actually expected it to be just as crowded as bailey's but was pleasantly surprised
2014-07-30 08:14:14	askore	if I was a connoisseur of such places I'd be more interested, but my interests are primarily coffee shops and similar.
2014-07-30 08:15:23	tamgc	yeah, it would definitely be a place to go
2014-07-30 08:21:04	tamgc	in a way, beers are kind of like coffee, you get this sort of wide variety of flavors...(except for the whole alcohol part heh), like they had this Breakside beer there that tasted like bourbon which was pretty good
2014-07-30 08:22:48	Fetter	were you getting beers this morning?
2014-07-30 08:22:51	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-30 08:23:25	 *	Fetter sings jingle..."the best part of waking up, is beer in your cup!"
2014-07-30 08:24:27	askore	tamgc: I don't like people, and in my limited experience caffeinated people are more bearable than drunk people
2014-07-30 08:25:04	askore	(this specifically has to do with public venues)
2014-07-30 08:25:30	Fetter	on the other hand, drunk droids are more fun than caffeinated ones
2014-07-30 08:25:47	Fetter	i mean, c3po drunk is way more tolerable than when he is strung out 
2014-07-30 08:25:51	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-30 08:27:36	tamgc	askore: heh true
2014-07-30 08:27:46	tamgc	Fetter: nah, hard liquor for the mornings
2014-07-30 08:30:09	tamgc	of the 4-5 different types of drunk people, only the 'happy drunk' are the kind that's fun to be around (sleepy, sad, angry, dopey, doc >.> <.<)
2014-07-30 08:30:59	Fetter	r2d2 might be fun?  
2014-07-30 08:31:05	tamgc	nah, he's an ass
2014-07-30 08:31:09	Fetter	he might put on a light show
2014-07-30 08:32:10	Fetter	you're right, CL4P-TP (or ClapTrap) would be fun
2014-07-30 08:32:16	tamgc	Belmont Station's a good place to find some random beers to try without the public venues portion though
2014-07-30 08:32:46	askore	quite possibly
2014-07-30 08:32:49	tamgc	(Well's Banana Bread beer was an interesting one...tasted like Banana Bread, which I didn't expect...but a bit of sourness to it from being beer)
2014-07-30 08:32:53	askore	haha
2014-07-30 08:32:55	askore	weird
2014-07-30 08:33:00	askore	so far not a big fan of beer but *shrug*
2014-07-30 08:33:07	 *	tamgc likes claptrap
2014-07-30 08:33:20	Fetter	i need a claptrap toy for my office
2014-07-30 08:33:26	Fetter	it's missing
2014-07-30 08:33:31	askore	supposedly he's a playable character in the prequel
2014-07-30 08:33:33	Fetter	i plan to cosplay marcus
2014-07-30 08:33:37	Fetter	at some point
2014-07-30 08:33:54	Fetter	i think that would work fairly well for me
2014-07-30 08:33:56	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-30 08:34:04	tamgc	beer's an acquired taste, a bit like coffee heh
2014-07-30 08:34:35	askore	mmm yeah
2014-07-30 08:34:38	askore	that's probably true
2014-07-30 08:34:42	tamgc	Fetter: heh I can see you as Marcus
2014-07-30 08:35:19	askore	.oO( I wonder if bajr got very far on the character sheets )
2014-07-30 08:35:31	Fetter	yeah, i have been wondering myself
2014-07-30 08:35:37	tamgc	as a coffee person, you'd probably like the darker beers more...
2014-07-30 08:35:38	Fetter	i brought my dice in today
2014-07-30 08:35:47	tamgc	ooh...you'd probably like Kona (the beer heh)
2014-07-30 08:35:52	Fetter	but, i have not heard back on the time or acceptance of my character
2014-07-30 08:36:07	askore	he was (supposedly) working on them last night
2014-07-30 08:36:13	askore	the character sheets that is
2014-07-30 08:36:14	Fetter	i won't be able to make it until 7 this evening, if my character is accepted
2014-07-30 08:36:35	askore	it's probably accepted, and 7 is probably about when we start
2014-07-30 08:36:35	Fetter	i'm assuming there is a concept acceptance process 
2014-07-30 08:36:46	Fetter	ah, ok...
2014-07-30 08:37:02	askore	I don't think it's acceptance so much as he's trying to make the sheets ahead of time so we don't spend three hours messing with gurps rules
2014-07-30 08:37:16	Fetter	ah
2014-07-30 08:37:29	tamgc	that and he's basically working on blending systems
2014-07-30 08:37:39	Fetter	i figured there might need to be some sort of "does this fit with the campaign" processing for him
2014-07-30 08:37:48	askore	well he'd probably tell you if that was the case
2014-07-30 08:37:54	Fetter	gotcha
2014-07-30 08:38:11	askore	and yeah if we all tried to roll the exact same character he'd have to go "no... guys no"
2014-07-30 08:38:13	askore	:P
2014-07-30 08:38:24	tamgc	nah, just clones
2014-07-30 08:38:43	tamgc	(ooh...a Paranoia campaign...heh)
2014-07-30 08:38:48	Fetter	the last part of the equation then, is where do i go for the game?  basement of FAB, I'm assuming but is there a more specific location
2014-07-30 08:39:02	tamgc	Fetter: most likely spot is CAT conference
2014-07-30 08:39:08	Fetter	ah, cool
2014-07-30 08:39:08	tamgc	(next to doghaus)
2014-07-30 08:39:13	Fetter	that makes it easy
2014-07-30 08:39:35	tamgc	or it could become a LARP and you use the entire FAB LL
2014-07-30 08:39:36	tamgc	=P
2014-07-30 08:39:46	askore	lol
2014-07-30 08:39:51	askore	that would be fabulous
2014-07-30 08:40:04	askore	we have two foam swords and a small militia's worth of nerf guns - I think we could make it work
2014-07-30 08:40:24	Fetter	might be better to LARP borderlands?
2014-07-30 08:40:27	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-30 08:40:37	askore	haha
2014-07-30 08:40:37	tamgc	heh, I know it could, just a matter of not annoying everyone else and/or the security guards =P
2014-07-30 08:40:57	askore	the security guards only seem to care about people following people through doors
2014-07-30 08:41:02	askore	I've never even SEEN them
2014-07-30 08:41:14	Fetter	we just take them out first
2014-07-30 08:41:16	tamgc	(iirc, katzen have gotten in trouble in the pass from such shennanigans >.>)
2014-07-30 08:41:17	Fetter	it's all good
2014-07-30 08:41:27	Fetter	uh-oh
2014-07-30 08:41:30	askore	and "everyone else" - if they're in the basement after 7pm and not hiding in a lab, they probably would welcome the distraction
2014-07-30 08:41:55	tamgc	summer would definitely be a better time for such things though
2014-07-30 08:42:22	Fetter	we need to get one of those giant loot chests
2014-07-30 08:42:40	Fetter	put it somewhere with nerf guns and such
2014-07-30 08:42:50	Fetter	some rations
2014-07-30 08:42:53	Fetter	;-)
2014-07-30 08:42:56	askore	haha
2014-07-30 08:43:01	askore	this sounds like an idea
2014-07-30 08:43:05	askore	quick, while it's still summer term
2014-07-30 08:43:21	tamgc	that's what the kegerator I hid under the tiles is for?
2014-07-30 08:43:26	askore	yup
2014-07-30 08:43:49	tamgc	(no, Fetter, not really =P)

2014-07-30 11:20:12	sabreman_work	thanks
2014-07-30 11:22:43	askore	stacybird: *poke* does it look like you're gonna be stuck knee deep in code?
2014-07-30 11:22:48	Fetter	my friend just let me borrow the 5th ed box set...i haven't had a chance to look it over myself
2014-07-30 11:23:45	Fetter	he said that it basically comes with a scenario, several pre-made chars, a dm book and most of it is all about how to role-play the chars well...there is nothing about making your own custom chars
2014-07-30 11:23:57	Fetter	i guess a players hand book comes out in a few weeks or something
2014-07-30 11:24:39	Fetter	my opinions are reserved about 5th ed as of yet, because 4th ed was a flop imo
2014-07-30 11:24:47	@bajr	3.5 ftw
2014-07-30 11:25:09	sabreman_work	this is at 6, right?
2014-07-30 11:25:31	Fetter	my understanding is that 5th ed is largely 3.5 with power gamer rules trimmed and more emphasis on roleplaying
2014-07-30 11:25:37	sabreman_work	also, bajr: people can actilvy controll magic right? Can it also be a passive thing?
2014-07-30 11:25:58	@bajr	sabreman_work: we meet at 6, go over characters for a bit, and probably start about 8
2014-07-30 11:26:01	@bajr	7-8
2014-07-30 11:26:06	sabreman_work	ok
2014-07-30 11:26:13	@bajr	sabreman_work: not much passive magic unless it's enchanted item
2014-07-30 11:26:21	Fetter	yeah, i won't be able to get back downtown until 7
2014-07-30 11:26:31	@bajr	Fetter: understood
2014-07-30 11:26:44	sabreman_work	how does active work?

2014-08-03 08:18:39	askore	turns out sleeping in a super dark bedroom isn't ideal for getting up early >.>
2014-08-03 10:18:10	stacybird	"couch"
2014-08-03 10:18:13	stacybird	:P
2014-08-03 10:19:41	askore	couch?
2014-08-03 10:19:54	askore	it may be a futon but it's in couch formation
2014-08-03 10:57:11	stacybird	oh!  last time I was there it was in bed formation
2014-08-03 10:57:25	stacybird	my mental image needed adjustment.
2014-08-03 10:59:34	askore	ah yeah it might have been
2014-08-03 11:20:07	tamgc	it's almost like it can change forms >.>
2014-08-03 20:00:21	nibalizer	more than meets the eye
2014-08-03 20:00:27	nibalizer	... with the couch
2014-08-03 20:51:38	askore	haha

2014-08-04 08:31:02	askore	cat chronicle
2014-08-04 08:31:49	askore	nix uses it, mostly unsuccessfully, to track low-priority issues
2014-08-04 08:32:00	tamgc	ah...
2014-08-04 08:32:07	tamgc	if only there was a ticketing system...
2014-08-04 08:32:18	askore	ehhh
2014-08-04 08:32:35	askore	yeah but this way the only people who get spammed are those who are watching a given ticket
2014-08-04 08:32:53	askore	it would be nice if we actually utilized it a lot more
2014-08-04 08:33:03	askore	as it is, it's usually an afterthought that nobody checks
2014-08-04 08:33:20	tamgc	sounds about right...
2014-08-04 08:33:22	askore	lol
2014-08-04 08:33:29	askore	and there's too many issues for it to be done efficiently
2014-08-04 08:33:42	tamgc	although snot does have a watchlist...or used to...
2014-08-04 08:33:51	askore	right but you get emailed by everything in snot anyway
2014-08-04 08:34:10	tamgc	just gotta reduce the number of issues so that it's efficient, problem solved ;)
2014-08-04 08:34:23	askore	yes, and in the process solve all the old issues
2014-08-04 08:34:28	askore	or at least determine they're not real issues
2014-08-04 08:34:34	askore	the snot watchlist is for people who use the snot interface
2014-08-04 08:34:37	tamgc	true, but you don't read everything unless it's addressed to you...right? >.>
2014-08-04 08:34:40	askore	I only ever interact with it through email
2014-08-04 08:34:48	askore	I browse but no I don't read everything
2014-08-04 08:35:20	askore	when I use snot through my email instead of through the interface I actually see a LOT more tickets.
2014-08-04 08:35:40	askore	cuz the interface is bad and it's easy to push 'k' repeatedly to browse mail
2014-08-04 08:35:59	tamgc	yeah, that's sort of expected
2014-08-04 08:36:11	askore	mhm
2014-08-04 08:36:20	askore	I've got a pretty good set of filters
2014-08-04 08:36:49	askore	support mail goes in one folder, chronicle mail and stuff addressed to me goes in another, root mail goes elsewhere (ugh so much root spam)
2014-08-04 08:36:57	askore	and everything else sits unorganized in my inbox
2014-08-04 08:37:03	 *	tamgc pretty much had things filtered as directed to me, various teams, or 'other'
2014-08-04 08:37:27	tamgc	procmail++
2014-08-04 08:37:30	askore	heh
2014-08-04 08:37:34	askore	I don't think gmail can procmail
2014-08-04 08:37:40	askore	it would be better if it could
2014-08-04 08:37:40	tamgc	yeah
2014-08-04 08:37:55	askore	procmail pretty good
2014-08-04 08:37:55	tamgc	saddest part about the switch to gmail
2014-08-04 08:37:59	askore	yeah heh
2014-08-04 08:38:28	tamgc	if the filtering system was a bit better or defaults were saner, that would be good too
2014-08-04 08:38:38	askore	or if it actually had a concept of folders
2014-08-04 08:38:40	askore	instead of tags
2014-08-04 08:38:42	askore	>.<
2014-08-04 08:38:50	 *	askore kinda looking forward to the new group of zombies and nix-recruits
2014-08-04 08:39:10	tamgc	as-is, I think by default 90% of my mail was marked important and was defaulted to float to the top or something wonky (been a while since I changed it)
2014-08-04 08:39:17	askore	lol
2014-08-04 08:39:27	tamgc	there's 'folders'
2014-08-04 08:39:37	askore	but mail can be in multiple folders
2014-08-04 08:39:48	tamgc	you just need to put it in "[Gmail]\folder" and archive
2014-08-04 08:39:53	tamgc	true
2014-08-04 08:39:54	askore	and to get it out of the inbox you have to "archive" it which doesn't make much sense
2014-08-04 08:40:05	tamgc	yeah
2014-08-04 08:40:23	tamgc	most of my filters move to a folder/archive heh
2014-08-04 08:40:40	tamgc	oh also mark as unimportant etc
2014-08-04 08:42:09	askore	heh yep
2014-08-04 08:42:22	askore	I don't bother much with the important flag
2014-08-04 08:42:32	askore	actually getting it to be accurate would be too difficult
2014-08-04 08:43:22	tamgc	yeah, oh and never mark as spam...because there's no good whitelisting...
2014-08-04 08:43:32	tamgc	yeah
2014-08-04 08:44:15	tamgc	I pretty much treat it as, if it's directed to me it's important, or if it's important enough, they'd use another channel of communication heh

2014-08-04 08:47:04	-->	sabreman_work (~ultra_sab@193.18.92.162) has joined #tabletop
2014-08-04 08:47:19	askore	yay, much bug fixes
2014-08-04 08:47:24	askore	of very old and irritating bugs
2014-08-04 08:47:43	tamgc	noice
2014-08-04 08:48:43	askore	mhm
2014-08-04 08:49:12	askore	the sad part about the rapid updates is that it's gonna take quite a while before all of the good tools (cough dwarf therapist cough) get updated
2014-08-04 08:49:34	 *	tamgc slightly amused by realization that you got to work on time to work on chronicle and read about DF =)
2014-08-04 08:49:38	askore	yes
2014-08-04 08:49:48	askore	at least I'm not playing df
2014-08-04 08:50:13	tamgc	does the dwarf therapist prevent your dwarves from running off walls?
2014-08-04 08:50:38	askore	no, it just makes managing labors way way easier
2014-08-04 08:51:04	askore	in vanilla there is no way to see a dwarf's skills and toggle labors on the same screen
2014-08-04 08:51:13	askore	and you have to go one dwarf at a time
2014-08-04 08:51:23	tamgc	heh
2014-08-04 08:51:26	askore	so in order to compare the skill of every dwarf to check who is your best, idk, potter
2014-08-04 08:51:34	askore	you would literally have to select every dwarf one by one
2014-08-04 08:51:57	tamgc	you just need to get really familiar with your dwarves -.-
2014-08-04 08:52:03	askore	which is excruciating at a dozen dwarves, never mind two hundred
2014-08-04 08:52:30	tamgc	it's good practice for getting to know your zombies >.> <.<
2014-08-04 08:52:55	askore	if it was even a keystroke such as c,<esc>,down,c, and so on
2014-08-04 08:52:57	askore	or something
2014-08-04 08:52:59	askore	but it's not
2014-08-04 08:53:01	askore	it's 
2014-08-04 08:53:22	askore	u,c,<esc>,u,down,c,<esc>
2014-08-04 08:53:24	askore	and so on
2014-08-04 08:53:44	askore	where the number of times you have to press down grows every time
2014-08-04 08:54:14	tamgc	heh, are there like zMUD equivilents for DF?
2014-08-04 08:55:04	askore	dunno what zmud is
2014-08-04 08:55:34	tamgc	-.- dang young'uns
2014-08-04 08:56:22	tamgc	it's a client made for MUDs, basically like a telnet/ssh client with built-in tools to help with playing
2014-08-04 08:56:35	askore	ahh
2014-08-04 08:56:41	askore	df runs locally so probably not
2014-08-04 08:56:47	tamgc	you could do macros, map out places, etc
2014-08-04 08:56:48	askore	unless someone's serving it over telnet/ssh
2014-08-04 08:57:09	askore	you can do macros in df but I still have to use my human eyes to read all of the info
2014-08-04 08:58:00	tamgc	iirc, zmud allowed for some basic scripting, or I might be confusing it with something else
2014-08-04 08:58:22	askore	it'd probably be too hard to grok
2014-08-04 08:58:27	tamgc	basically was thinking something like that where you can have something parse your stuff for you
2014-08-04 08:58:35	askore	I'd have to parse out the entire map
2014-08-04 08:58:57	askore	also if it was low enough on the list that I had to scroll down to see the specific labor I wanted.... >.>
2014-08-04 08:59:27	tamgc	heh
2014-08-04 09:01:33	tamgc	you can generally mimic anything a player could do...but yeah, it'll req some logic to be worked out...
2014-08-04 09:01:58	askore	yeah the doing isn't the problem, the grok'ing is the hard one
2014-08-04 09:02:04	askore	oh also skills aren't shown numerically
2014-08-04 09:02:07	tamgc	yeah
2014-08-04 09:02:08	askore	they're *described*
2014-08-04 09:02:12	tamgc	oooh...
2014-08-04 09:02:21	askore	"legendary miner", "proficient diagnostician"
2014-08-04 09:02:41	tamgc	so you'd need to map those out in some fashion...yeah... -.-
2014-08-04 09:02:47	askore	mhm
2014-08-04 09:03:04	tamgc	plenty of time to do that while in ADP though >.> <.<
2014-08-04 09:03:08	askore	lol
2014-08-04 09:03:13	askore	hopefully not
2014-08-04 09:04:05	tamgc	how many more weeks do you have left there?
2014-08-04 09:04:08	askore	three
2014-08-04 09:05:58	tamgc	did you finish up that ASA/VPN project?
2014-08-04 09:07:35	sabreman_work	askore: was it an over-the-summer internship?
2014-08-04 09:07:47	askore	sabreman_work: yeah it was 10 weeks
2014-08-04 09:07:58	askore	tamgc: nope, didn't really get any traction on that
2014-08-04 09:09:01	askore	I think it was given to the contractor to do instead
2014-08-04 09:09:13	tamgc	ah boo
2014-08-04 09:09:16	askore	yeah :(
2014-08-04 09:10:00	sabreman_work	man, it's really wierd when your coworkers (that have worked at the company for like 13 years) come to you, the 5 month intern, for suggestions and ideas
2014-08-04 09:10:27	askore	nah it means you're valuable and in a good place
2014-08-04 09:10:40	askore	it's much better than being given "toy" projects and left alone
2014-08-04 09:10:43	askore	>.>
2014-08-04 09:11:19	tamgc	depends on the toys=)
2014-08-04 09:11:43	askore	maybe
2014-08-04 09:11:47	askore	but I mostly meant "unimportant"
2014-08-04 09:12:07	sabreman_work	it's still feels strange and somewhat intimidating
2014-08-04 09:12:21	sabreman_work	askore: is that what you've been getting?
2014-08-04 09:12:25	askore	mhm
2014-08-04 09:12:27	sabreman_work	toy stuff?
2014-08-04 09:12:38	askore	largely not enough work being given
2014-08-04 09:12:53	tamgc	sabreman_work: heh, sooner or later it'll happen, and people will always be on some level your senior or junior
2014-08-04 09:12:55	askore	I'm not factored into sprint planning (i.e. putting my hours on the board thing)
2014-08-04 09:13:04	askore	so I don't have enough to do and I'm annoyed
2014-08-04 09:13:22	sabreman_work	awww. Yeah having only 2 hours of work for an 8 hour day can suck a lot
2014-08-04 09:13:32	askore	mmhm
2014-08-04 09:13:36	askore	I'd much rather be in over my head
2014-08-04 09:20:53	tamgc	that++ (being a giant amongst men may be good for the ego, but a man among giants is how you learn/grow)
2014-08-04 09:44:47	stacybird	oh right:  askore are they going to use your expertise this week?  :P
2014-08-04 09:45:08	askore	stacybird: unknown, probably
2014-08-04 09:47:06	sabreman_work	Does anyone in here do WPC stuff with c#?
2014-08-04 09:47:16	sabreman_work	or am I a special snowflake
2014-08-04 09:47:35	 *	askore hasn't done any significant amount of c#
2014-08-04 09:47:56	sabreman_work	s/wpc/wpf
2014-08-04 09:47:58	 *	jesusaurus couldnt pick c# out of a language line-up
2014-08-04 09:48:02	askore	haha
2014-08-04 09:48:11	 *	askore couldn't either, probably
2014-08-04 09:51:31	stacybird	sabreman_work: I've done some c# (reminds me of a java... a bit)  :-|  but not wpf
2014-08-04 09:52:40	sabreman_work	shuks
2014-08-04 09:53:21	sabreman_work	I'm trying to do stuff with WPF and animations, and it's being rather....uncooperetive.
2014-08-04 09:54:13	stacybird	lol.  so far in my experience c# is.... less than cooperative.  ;-)
2014-08-04 09:54:21	stacybird	sorry all I have is snark.
2014-08-04 09:54:24	stacybird	:-)
2014-08-04 09:54:38	askore	heh
2014-08-04 09:55:17	sabreman_work	you gotta get to know it first, then it becomes the best langauge ever :p
2014-08-04 09:55:43	askore	hmmmmm
2014-08-04 09:55:46	askore	that sounds not true... >.>
2014-08-04 09:55:49	sabreman_work	think of c# as the magnificently buetifull baby of java and c++
2014-08-04 09:55:58	sabreman_work	it has all the good from both, and none of the bad
2014-08-04 09:56:26	sabreman_work	you can do manual mem manegment (and pointer stuff) if you want, and can let it's fast gc handle it if you don't
2014-08-04 09:56:41	sabreman_work	events, threading, async, properties
2014-08-04 09:56:51	sabreman_work	all of these things make coding with it a breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze
2014-08-04 09:57:10	sabreman_work	WPF on the other hand is strange, wierd and very hard at times....
2014-08-04 09:57:43	stacybird	maybe its just that I'm working on a C# project thats been around forevar
2014-08-04 09:57:48	sabreman_work	Anyway, enough of my c# propoganda for now
2014-08-04 09:57:52	stacybird	lol
2014-08-04 09:57:59	sabreman_work	yeah, start a fresh one for something fun
2014-08-04 09:58:04	stacybird	fair
2014-08-04 09:58:06	stacybird	:-)
2014-08-04 09:58:07	sabreman_work	like a tick tack toe game or something
2014-08-04 09:58:35	sabreman_work	(you get a shit ton of console control out-of-the-box with c# too, no need for winapi hooks like c++)
2014-08-04 09:59:06	sabreman_work	like: Console.Foregroundcolor = ConsoleColor.Red
2014-08-04 09:59:25	sabreman_work	or Console.SetCursourPosition(12,23);
2014-08-04 09:59:27	sabreman_work	etc.
2014-08-04 09:59:31	askore	to be honest, I don't like languages with garbage collection, because I don't understand my code as well if I don't know where the memory is dealloated
2014-08-04 09:59:36	 *	askore has written a LOT of C and C++
2014-08-04 09:59:49	sabreman_work	it's really strange at first yeah
2014-08-04 10:00:01	 *	stacybird nods
2014-08-04 10:00:03	askore	I mean I've written quite a bit of java as well but the internals are as clear as mud.
2014-08-04 10:00:09	askore	I understand C and C++ at a nearly bitwise level
2014-08-04 10:00:40	stacybird	yeah the point of java is a bit of magic
2014-08-04 10:00:47	stacybird	in the form of gc
2014-08-04 10:00:50	 *	askore is a kernel hacker at heart >.>
2014-08-04 10:00:51	stacybird	although
2014-08-04 10:01:00	stacybird	that seem to be why new relic
2014-08-04 10:01:03	stacybird	:D
2014-08-04 10:01:17	sabreman_work	I mean in the end, if you want, you can turn off the gc and only do unmanged code in c#. 
2014-08-04 10:01:35	sabreman_work	that way it's basically c++ but with a ton more stuff and actualy desinged to be OO from the ground up
2014-08-04 10:02:13	askore	heh
2014-08-04 10:02:19	sabreman_work	(Ok I guess the propoganda isn't done yet)
2014-08-04 10:02:23	askore	appears so
2014-08-04 10:02:36	sabreman_work	my favorite thing that i've done with c# that's impossible with c++ is reflrection based UI
2014-08-04 10:02:51	askore	tui forever
2014-08-04 10:02:56	sabreman_work	I have an object, and use reflection to iteratte all of it's proeprties
2014-08-04 10:03:15	sabreman_work	I then create the appropriate UI elements for each (ie: checkbox for bool, textbox for string, etc).
2014-08-04 10:03:23	sabreman_work	and do validation using reflection.
2014-08-04 10:03:25	askore	I live in the world of devops - if a ui is anything other than a means to an end, I don't want to write it
2014-08-04 10:03:46	sabreman_work	that way If I need to modify what's on screen, I simpoly remove/add properties to an object instead of having to manualy create the UI
2014-08-04 10:03:49	sabreman_work	and validation
2014-08-04 10:04:10	sabreman_work	ok NOW im done, I prmise this time.
2014-08-04 10:04:12	sabreman_work	:p
2014-08-04 10:04:38	askore	heh
2014-08-04 10:06:55	askore	stacybird: the food bank sent an email thanking us for volunteering :D
2014-08-04 10:14:21	stacybird	awwww!
2014-08-04 10:14:25	stacybird	:D
2014-08-04 10:14:39	 *	stacybird is performing a house temperature experiment
2014-08-04 10:14:50	stacybird	closing all windows today to see what happens
2014-08-04 10:14:53	askore	ooo
2014-08-04 10:15:11	stacybird	the hottest the downstairs every gets is 77
2014-08-04 10:15:16	askore	impressive.
2014-08-04 10:15:17	stacybird	on a hot hot hot day
2014-08-04 10:15:37	stacybird	I'm going to see if closed upstairs helps cool retention
2014-08-04 10:15:47	stacybird	usually I leave upstairs open
2014-08-04 10:15:51	stacybird	Science!
2014-08-04 10:16:04	 *	stacybird wants net-connected temp sensors
2014-08-04 10:16:11	askore	hehe
2014-08-04 10:16:17	askore	internet of things!
2014-08-04 10:16:25	stacybird	exactly!
2014-08-04 10:16:32	 *	askore hungry
2014-08-04 10:16:42	stacybird	awww
2014-08-04 10:16:49	stacybird	you will have to get fud without me
2014-08-04 10:16:55	askore	indeed
2014-08-04 10:17:10	askore	not sure if I should try to get something from upstairs, or just go to food carts
2014-08-04 10:17:12	 *	stacybird is enjoying coding from home, but I should go back to looking at code again
2014-08-04 10:17:20	askore	coding is good
2014-08-04 10:17:25	stacybird	O.o  10am food carts?
2014-08-04 10:17:29	askore	no
2014-08-04 10:17:31	askore	lol
2014-08-04 10:17:35	askore	I mean about lunch
2014-08-04 10:17:39	stacybird	lol
2014-08-04 10:18:12	askore	there are a lot of options upstairs though...
2014-08-04 10:18:25	askore	I should find something to make a whole bunch of leftovers of
2014-08-04 10:18:30	askore	for the rest of the week
2014-08-04 10:20:20	stacybird	oooh!
2014-08-04 10:20:30	stacybird	crockpot bbq pork.  :P
2014-08-04 10:20:38	stacybird	easy and nom
2014-08-04 10:20:51	askore	yeah but I'd have to either cook it overnight or not have it for lunch tomorrow
2014-08-04 10:21:11	askore	if I hadn't spent all yesterday cleaning, I could have used it to cook things.....
2014-08-04 10:21:39	askore	someday I will figure out a stricter way of spending time. Saturday is for cleaning, sunday is for cooking, the rest of the week is for being at work
2014-08-04 10:22:29	askore	ooh the last recipe on this page sounds really good http://38.media.tumblr.com/5d6b46dfb7bf4f85488976fd0d9e446d/tumblr_n9ksonpJI81tcwlljo1_1280.png
2014-08-04 10:25:26	stacybird	thus the crockpot idea.
2014-08-04 10:25:40	stacybird	you toss food and spices in pot, turn on, ignore.
2014-08-04 10:25:46	stacybird	remember at some point, eat.
2014-08-04 10:25:47	stacybird	:P
2014-08-04 10:25:55	askore	not sure if ignoring it overnight is a great idea
2014-08-04 10:26:03	stacybird	sure!
2014-08-04 10:26:12	stacybird	I usually cook crockpot things overnight.
2014-08-04 10:26:20	stacybird	particularly pork
2014-08-04 10:26:40	stacybird	just make sure your crockpot has latching top for kitteh-proofing
2014-08-04 10:26:43	askore	lol
2014-08-04 10:26:45	askore	it doesn't
2014-08-04 10:26:48	stacybird	lol
2014-08-04 10:26:51	stacybird	mine does. 
2014-08-04 10:26:58	stacybird	it was.... 30? $40?
2014-08-04 10:26:58	askore	mine just has a lid
2014-08-04 10:27:02	stacybird	from FM
2014-08-04 10:27:07	askore	mmhm
2014-08-04 10:27:15	askore	I got this one from my parents
2014-08-04 10:27:26	askore	it may or may not have lost the handle on the on-off switch :P
2014-08-04 10:27:36	stacybird	lol
2014-08-04 10:27:51	askore	(by which I mean it popped off long ago and I don't know if I lost it or stuck it back on)
2014-08-04 10:28:28	stacybird	heh
2014-08-04 10:28:51	askore	now I'm hungry :<
2014-08-04 10:29:20	askore	anyway
2014-08-04 10:29:44	askore	the problem still stands that by the time I get home I have very very little patience for doing the initialization parts of putting something in a crockpot
2014-08-04 10:29:47	askore	which, again, leaves the weeend
2014-08-04 10:29:49	askore	weekend*
2014-08-04 10:30:41	askore	for example, last night I had sausage & eggs for dinner, under the guise of seasoning my cast iron pan, because I couldn't be bothered to do anything more complex
2014-08-04 10:51:01	tamgc	weekend pre-portion things to dump in crockpot maybe?
2014-08-04 10:52:32	tamgc	or just pre-portioned things to toss in $thing in general (steamer/oven/stove)
2014-08-04 11:00:16	askore	\o/ time to get started on stuff
2014-08-04 11:00:26	askore	tamgc: yeah like that's the perfect plan
2014-08-04 11:00:29	askore	I just have to DO that thing
2014-08-04 11:01:44	tamgc	or coerce others to do it for you >.>
2014-08-04 11:01:59	jesusaurus	sounds like you need some minions
2014-08-04 11:02:00	askore	it would be cool to have a roommate though
2014-08-04 11:02:02	askore	:P
2014-08-04 11:02:08	tamgc	jesusaurus++
2014-08-04 11:02:14	askore	my cat is a minion right? just no opposable thumbs
2014-08-04 11:02:30	jesusaurus	wait, you can get your cat to do your bidding?
2014-08-04 11:02:33	jesusaurus	are you a wizard?
2014-08-04 11:02:57	stacybird	I wish sometimes I had a rommmate.  however fiancee wishing privacy makes that wish difficult to implement.
2014-08-04 11:03:04	stacybird	weekend roommate?  :P
2014-08-04 11:03:12	jesusaurus	(weekend roommat)++

2014-08-04 11:03:41	askore	I have a futon which looks suspiciously like a bed sometimes
2014-08-04 11:03:43	stacybird	and both rooms I want cable in already hs jacks, so he just have to test/cable trace.
2014-08-04 11:03:46	stacybird	woo
2014-08-04 11:03:50	askore	and would facilitate a roommate who didn't require great volumes of privacy
2014-08-04 11:04:15	 *	stacybird has sufficient house to have a roommate, just not sufficient partner wishes.
2014-08-04 11:04:18	stacybird	:P
2014-08-04 11:04:20	askore	haha
2014-08-04 11:04:22	askore	yep
2014-08-04 11:04:24	stacybird	funny how life is like that
2014-08-04 11:04:40	askore	all I need is someone who is willing to trade 'sleeping in the living room' for 'very low rent'
2014-08-04 11:06:35	stacybird	lol.  I could totest have a housemate and it would double my landlandy's income.
2014-08-04 11:06:38	stacybird	lol
2014-08-04 11:07:17	askore	orly?
2014-08-04 11:07:21	askore	oh I see

2014-08-04 11:09:14	askore	hmmmm
2014-08-04 11:09:24	askore	I strongly suspect this is going to be done in about half an hour
2014-08-04 11:13:03	stacybird	heh.  8-12 window for comcast.  good this I told work hey I'm out 8-12.  that window is about over.

2014-08-04 12:25:07	relsqui	<_< I feel bad that some people got everything right on the deskcat quiz except for one of the trick questions
2014-08-04 12:25:17	relsqui	also, some people pointed out a question as being a trick that wasn't
2014-08-04 12:30:20	mancat	akore: the one just e other side of Laughing Planet?
2014-08-04 12:30:34	mancat	*askore

2014-08-04 12:37:02	askore	haha
2014-08-04 12:37:05	relsqui	and then not, because bd

2014-08-04 12:37:12	relsqui	because professionalism, or something
2014-08-04 12:37:35	relsqui	that was confusing, I was trying to add an x to a row of x's in a file in vim
2014-08-04 12:37:40	relsqui	was in normal mode, so I removed one instead of adding one
2014-08-04 12:37:43	relsqui	briefly disconcerted
2014-08-04 12:37:49	Fox	I've done that
2014-08-04 12:37:57	Fox	Then I asked myself why I had so many x's
2014-08-04 12:37:59	relsqui	lol
2014-08-04 12:38:03	Fox	And it become a line of ===========

2014-08-04 12:44:44	askore	it's very frustrating but also amusing to have everything stacked up vertically
2014-08-04 12:44:50	Fox	ehehe
2014-08-04 12:45:02	Fox	Yesterday, my players tried to haul a dragon hoard.

2014-08-04 12:45:10	askore	smart move
2014-08-04 12:45:30	Fox	The looks on their faces when I had to inform them that their party couldn't actually take it all was priceless
2014-08-04 12:45:39	askore	hehe
2014-08-04 12:46:00	Fox	I have 2 fighters with 20+ Strength at level 6
2014-08-04 12:46:05	Fox	And they were like
2014-08-04 12:46:09	Fox	"That's some bullshit."
2014-08-04 12:46:14	Fox	and I could only respond
2014-08-04 12:46:22	Fox	"No, there's just more than half a ton of coinage and pottery."
2014-08-04 12:46:32	askore	lol
2014-08-04 12:46:51	askore	speaking of pottery, I've gotten into the habit of starting pottery industry early in dwarf fortress
2014-08-04 12:47:19	askore	not as heavy as stone, easier to pump the value, and doesn't eat through stockpiles
2014-08-04 12:47:41	askore	cheap crafts to buy ALL the goods from caravans
2014-08-04 12:48:24	tamgc	karmabot: askore is also running a pot-driven economy

2014-08-04 12:49:34	tamgc	not my fault karmabot was designed differently -.-
2014-08-04 12:50:04	tamgc	Fox: did they go back to town and hire a bunch of people to start looting the place?
2014-08-04 12:50:49	Fox	Noooo
2014-08-04 12:51:06	Fox	They evacuated quickly when a ballista bolt hit the clock tower they were inside of
2014-08-04 12:51:13	askore	lol
2014-08-04 12:51:30	Fox	and were very happy when I informed them that a solid 12 seconds after they descended the tower, explosives went off on the bottom floor and it collapsed
2014-08-04 12:51:47	tamgc	(and that's why you always grab the expensive gems first >.> <.<)
2014-08-04 12:51:50	Fox	Brian: "Would that have killed us?"
2014-08-04 12:51:57	Fox	Me: "No shit."

2014-08-04 12:52:31	Fox	They made off with the artworks, platinum coinage, gemstones, and heavier mundaneties like weaponry and jewelry
2014-08-04 12:52:39	Fox	And then booked it
2014-08-04 12:52:41	Fetter	i usually go the for the shiney talking swords
2014-08-04 12:52:45	Fox	and alas, did not die for their greed
2014-08-04 12:53:03	Fox	There was a shiny talking sword. Ignacio Redtail is currently holding a cursed sword, actually.
2014-08-04 12:53:05	tamgc	Fetter: depends on the talking sword =)
2014-08-04 12:53:06	Fox	He'll find out soon enough. :)
2014-08-04 12:53:17	tamgc	(being cursed with one is slightly annoying)
2014-08-04 12:53:22	Fox	^

2014-08-04 12:54:10	Fox	This one could only communicate through telepathy to its wielder, unfortunately. :(
2014-08-04 12:54:30	Fox	However, Brian's face when I whispered, "Oh, they're sneaky ones... they want what's mine... no no no..."
2014-08-04 12:54:35	Fox	was worth the limitation.
2014-08-04 12:54:35	Fox	:)
2014-08-04 12:55:06	tamgc	hah
2014-08-04 12:55:27	Fox	My party is currently filthy-rich and realizing they have nothing to do with the money.
2014-08-04 12:55:37	Fox	1st-world problems for everybody!
2014-08-04 12:55:56	askore	lol
2014-08-04 12:56:14	tamgc	Fox: well, they can use it as bait for people wanting money...
2014-08-04 12:56:43	Fox	tamgc: They're currently seeing if their gunslinger can make silver bullets out of the coins. :)
2014-08-04 12:57:01	Fox	(Short answer is yea, but the player has no Knowledge (engineering)...)
2014-08-04 12:57:07	tamgc	fame and fortune tends to bring out people who wants that fortune =)
2014-08-04 12:58:01	Fox	Yup. :)
2014-08-04 12:58:39	 *	tamgc done trying to get unknown party killed...nap time
2014-08-04 12:59:50	Fetter	yeah, the problem with high magic and loot is that adventurers can quickly be richer than most larger cities
2014-08-04 13:00:08	Fetter	in most adventure settings, a single magic item can be worth than most towns
2014-08-04 13:52:13	Takua	Sorry, we were saying that's a problem...?
2014-08-04 13:52:36	Takua	I like becoming as rich as a king by plundering long-forgotten treasures and murdering the vile assholes who hold them
2014-08-04 13:52:47	Takua	Or, on the flip side of things, killing the king and taking his treasury
2014-08-04 13:53:51	Takua	(Killing the king to destabilize the region, driving up the profits of my other investments as prices skyrocket, and allowing me to offload my less conspicuous and less useful magical items as a premium)

2014-08-04 14:31:33	relsqui	karmabot: takua is unapologetically exploitatively evil
2014-08-04 14:31:33	karmabot	Alright, relsqui.
2014-08-04 14:34:03	 *	askore grumbles
2014-08-04 14:35:15	askore	for all that we create lots of good and useful issues on chronicle, I wish it actually helped get things done
2014-08-04 14:35:39	nightfly	lol
2014-08-04 14:36:02	nightfly	any specific requests?
2014-08-04 14:36:31	askore	not really, it just seems like there's a ton of low-hanging fruit that ryan put his name on, commented on once or twice, and then left. And most of the roadmap is like that.
2014-08-04 14:36:40	nightfly	also, fuck docker. I have no fucking clue how to debug this random image I got from the internet
2014-08-04 14:36:43	askore	hahaha
2014-08-04 14:37:24	askore	anyway I kind of want to just take some of the easy tickets and finish them so that they're done
2014-08-04 14:37:33	askore	but newbies complain that there's no entry level tasks
2014-08-04 14:37:41	askore	(maybe they don't do that, maybe that's a need that I made up in my head)
2014-08-04 14:38:01	nightfly	unassign ryan from some of them
2014-08-04 14:38:18	 *	askore should do scratching post again
2014-08-04 14:38:54	askore	nobody else is doing stuff though
2014-08-04 14:38:56	nightfly	do you come to the thursday things?
2014-08-04 14:39:01	askore	no?
2014-08-04 14:39:06	askore	what happens on thursday?
2014-08-04 14:39:22	nightfly	Nix hacking sessions @ 6pm Thursdays in Texas
2014-08-04 14:39:30	askore	ah I see
2014-08-04 14:39:35	nightfly	Formerly droog/droog-1 training
2014-08-04 14:39:42	askore	and people hsow up?
2014-08-04 14:39:44	askore	show*
2014-08-04 14:39:50	nightfly	yup, and even do things
2014-08-04 14:40:04	askore	so it might be helpful if I did unassign some tickets so they could be triaged at hacking session
2014-08-04 14:40:38	nightfly	sounds reasonable
2014-08-04 14:41:14	askore	cuz for example, there's the kvm switch thing that I don't know the status on; if that's not done, hardware-minded people might like to do it
2014-08-04 14:41:23	askore	or the "git hook to close snot and redmine tickets"
2014-08-04 14:44:59	relsqui	askore: you're not wrong about easy tasks for newbies. I think that's not an urgent need right now because most of the new n1xians are pretty up to speed, but there will be more new ones presumably
2014-08-04 14:45:11	relsqui	otoh if stuff needs to get done stuff needs to get done, the timing just happens to be poor
2014-08-04 14:45:55	askore	it would be nice to clean out some of this old stuff
2014-08-04 14:45:59	Fetter	Takua, sorry,  had to step away...just read your response...it's only a problem if you run campaign settings where you are trying to keep some semi-realistic representation of economics and government 
2014-08-04 14:46:06	askore	also there are slightly more advanced tasks available for people wishing to be helpful
2014-08-04 14:46:28	askore	but blkperl has an annoying tendency to assign four or five zombies to the same task on the hopes that one of them will succeed >.>
2014-08-04 14:46:34	relsqui	lol
2014-08-04 14:46:41	askore	which means not much gets completed
2014-08-04 14:46:46	relsqui	why does that make it not get done?
2014-08-04 14:46:53	askore	ah not quite
2014-08-04 14:47:14	askore	it means while multiple people are, for example, trying to set up rabbitmq
2014-08-04 14:47:21	askore	the other available newbie tasks go un-attempted
2014-08-04 14:47:26	relsqui	ah
2014-08-04 14:47:43	askore	and eventually it'll get done, but bandwidth was not increased by putting multiple people on it
2014-08-04 15:00:12	Takua	Good times
2014-08-04 15:00:35	Takua	Fetter: Yeah, that makes sense.  I'm just being silly and somewhat evil today because there was a lack of sleep when my pager went off at 3 AM on Sat morning
2014-08-04 15:00:52	askore	Takua: would you say you feel like a BOFH today.....

2014-08-05 01:23:46	Fox	Seriously
2014-08-05 01:24:07	Fox	Make a pie, then put on rubber gloves and crush it
2014-08-05 01:24:10	Fox	then mix it with brown sugar.
2014-08-05 01:24:11	Fox	Cobbler.
2014-08-05 01:26:14	relsqui	mmmm
2014-08-05 01:26:14	 *	Fox chirps like a cricket.
2014-08-05 01:26:23	relsqui	:P was in another window
2014-08-05 01:26:43	Fox	I just realized that this channel was silent for 8 hours.
2014-08-05 01:26:48	Fox	Which is both phenomenal and queer.
2014-08-05 01:27:07	Fox	It's usually bustling with things I don't read into the wee hours of the morning...
2014-08-05 01:28:54	Fox	http://devburmak.deviantart.com/art/Paizo-char-Valeros-260296713
2014-08-05 01:28:54	relsqui	I think as this channel has gotten more populous, some of those conversations have moved to smaller places
2014-08-05 01:29:01	Fox	Fighter finds a magic sword...
2014-08-05 01:29:08	relsqui	this channel was that place because it was smaller than, say, 3nts and meow and such
2014-08-05 01:29:44	Fox	Yeah
2014-08-05 01:29:52	Fox	I've never used #meow because it's huuuuge
2014-08-05 07:19:41	tamgc	#meow just tends to have mostly lurkers, very few active folks these days =/
2014-08-05 07:20:37	askore	mmhm
2014-08-05 07:21:42	askore	weirdly, I'm perfectly on time today.
2014-08-05 07:21:56	askore	woke up on time and everything
2014-08-05 07:36:28	tamgc	huzzah heh
2014-08-05 08:05:28	tamgc	thinking uhura might enjoy some of these: http://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/26-hacks-that-will-make-any-cat-owners-life-easier
2014-08-05 08:06:38	askore	ooh I like the tent one
2014-08-05 08:08:42	tamgc	you may need to wear bigger shirts for that one =P
2014-08-05 08:09:27	tamgc	(looks like medium according to instructions)
2014-08-05 08:09:38	askore	yeah
2014-08-05 08:09:46	askore	men's medium, maybe - not women's
2014-08-05 08:09:55	askore	and I don't have wire hangers but I should be able to find some
2014-08-05 08:10:01	askore	also the top-entry litter box :o
2014-08-05 08:11:45	askore	I should figure out where my kitchen gloves disappeared to.
2014-08-05 08:27:59	Fetter	i designed a magic sword once that had it's own level progression unbeknownst to the wielder...essentially, it was an AI that got more intelligent over time (and more powerful)
2014-08-05 08:28:25	Fetter	unfortunately, it's full potential was never realized because the campaign didn't run long enough
2014-08-05 08:31:45	tamgc	that'll be interesting...have a sword with an AI...that you eventually have to have a battle of wills to see who control who
2014-08-05 08:31:55	tamgc	(insert 'm's as needed >.>)
2014-08-05 08:36:05	Fetter	yep, that was the idea
2014-08-05 08:37:01	Fetter	at lower levels it was highly helpful, so that the wielder would find it difficult to want to get rid of...it had now cursed property that didn't allow it to be released, it was more of a roleplayed moral dilemma
2014-08-05 08:37:33	Fetter	later, however, it would start having new abilities that did indeed have battle of wills element
2014-08-05 08:38:10	Fetter	it developed psionic abilities and had various mind affecting magics
2014-08-05 10:34:31	relsqui	what the absolute fuck http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-emts-turn-officers-beat-handcuffed-patient-article-1.1891706

2014-08-06 10:17:01	askore	?
2014-08-06 10:17:01	Fetter	i could bring munchkins
2014-08-06 10:17:13	Fetter	or fluxx
2014-08-06 10:17:24	Fetter	munchkins is more involved a bit
2014-08-06 10:17:40	 *	stacybird will be caring for Betsy at home regardless.
2014-08-06 10:18:40	Fetter	if i recall (i haven't been able to play recently), i have cthulhu, vampire and pirate munchkins
2014-08-06 10:19:16	askore	huh
2014-08-06 10:19:21	Fetter	and i have monty python, zombie and cthulhu fluxx
2014-08-06 10:19:46	askore	I've mostly played base munchkin
2014-08-06 10:20:07	Fetter	i actually haven't played the base
2014-08-06 10:20:09	askore	every time I play any of the other ones there's so many put together it's hard to actually see any of the other things
2014-08-06 10:20:19	askore	er, any of the new things I guess
2014-08-06 10:20:28	Fetter	i always got the themed versions and i keep them separate
2014-08-06 10:20:51	askore	like cthulhu munchkin seems to have quite a bit of extra mechanics going on but I never see them happen
2014-08-06 10:21:26	Fetter	yeah, i think it has some extra weird stuff from what i can tell
2014-08-06 10:21:37	askore	err
2014-08-06 10:21:47	Fetter	that's the one i started with, so i didn't realize the others had less mechanics
2014-08-06 10:21:47	askore	my function keys suddenly stopped working
2014-08-06 10:21:49	askore	O.o
2014-08-06 10:22:35	Fetter	fluxx is a bit less involved but it's a fun game...the rules change as you play and it's different every time
2014-08-06 10:22:41	Fetter	have you played fluxx before?
2014-08-06 10:22:42	askore	yeah
2014-08-06 10:22:53	askore	there's a couple decks in the ACM game cabinet
2014-08-06 10:23:06	Fetter	did you like that one or prefer the more involved munckins?
2014-08-06 10:23:17	tamgc	they stopped...functioning?...*crickets* =)
2014-08-06 10:23:17	askore	I've gotten into a pretty epic round of "put the entire deck into your hand" :P
2014-08-06 10:23:17	Fetter	i keep thinking about getting the new netrunner game too
2014-08-06 10:23:34	Fetter	nice
2014-08-06 10:23:36	askore	I really like munchkin but I always end up playing with rules lawyers who suck th efun out of it
2014-08-06 10:23:37	tamgc	bajr is out camping this week iirc, so that's why he's out
2014-08-06 10:23:46	askore	oooo
2014-08-06 10:24:24	tamgc	netrunner's pretty fun, decent size portland group too
2014-08-06 10:24:36	Fetter	oh really?
2014-08-06 10:24:48	Fetter	i just found out it had a re-release not too long ago
2014-08-06 10:24:57	tamgc	yeah, I like the asymmetric deck/play style design of it
2014-08-06 10:25:06	tamgc	never played the original one
2014-08-06 10:25:10	Fetter	i have a runner and corp deck from the original netrunner
2014-08-06 10:25:14	tamgc	only caveat is it's designed for 1v1
2014-08-06 10:25:31	Fetter	ah, yeah...that kind of doesn't work for a group then
2014-08-06 10:25:58	tamgc	unless you pair up and even then timing of finished games would be off
2014-08-06 10:29:21	Fetter	so, is there a preference on which munchkins i should bring (cthulhu, pirate or vampire)?  how many people would be playing or are interested?
2014-08-06 10:31:06	askore	all the munchkins
2014-08-06 10:31:30	askore	I have no idea how many people, but playing muchkin tends to get everyone to join in
2014-08-06 10:34:02	Fetter	i have another game that i just picked up recently but haven't played yet called "Dungeon Roll"
2014-08-06 10:34:11	Fetter	it comes in a little treasure chest
2014-08-06 10:34:13	askore	ooh
2014-08-06 10:34:16	askore	that game is quite fun
2014-08-06 10:36:47	Fetter	yeah, it seemed fun
2014-08-06 10:36:55	Fetter	i could bring that
2014-08-06 10:37:14	Fetter	that's probably a closer replacement for a regular rpg
2014-08-06 10:37:23	askore	I think we should just set up a game table in the cs lounge and collect people who want to play
2014-08-06 10:37:39	askore	if there's an acm person around we can get them to open the game cabinet
2014-08-06 10:38:13	Fetter	yeah, i would just want to make sure my games don't get mistaken for the general public games in the cabinet
2014-08-06 10:38:42	askore	yup
2014-08-06 10:38:49	askore	I think all theirs have "ACM" written on
2014-08-06 10:38:52	askore	them
2014-08-06 10:38:55	Fetter	ah
2014-08-06 10:39:16	Fetter	well, i'll bring some things then and be back down around 7pm
2014-08-06 10:39:25	askore	let's see

2014-08-06 10:39:46	askore	benzer: Pash stacybird dom 
2014-08-06 10:39:48	askore	^
2014-08-06 10:39:55	askore	we're gonna do games in the cs lounge
2014-08-06 10:40:11	 *	askore needs to reboot laptop, the arrow keys are even messed up :(

2014-08-06 10:52:41	askore	yeah that too
2014-08-06 10:52:49	 *	askore is enjoying no summer classes
2014-08-06 10:52:56	benzer	askore: is this at 7:00? I Will probably be around :)
2014-08-06 10:54:55	askore	benzer: yup
2014-08-06 10:55:02	askore	in place of bajr-game
2014-08-06 10:55:08	askore	we shall have other-games
2014-08-06 10:57:15	benzer	kewl
2014-08-06 11:26:41	stacybird	if you want even moar ppl you could announce in g&m
2014-08-06 12:24:05	Fetter	well, don't announce just yet...i may not be able to make it now...possible scheduling snafu again  :-(
2014-08-06 12:24:48	Fetter	however, i will be here this saturday and sunday for a few hours and will likely be bored, so it's possible there could be some gaming madness, if folks are around?
2014-08-06 12:26:52	 *	askore usually doesn't -> psu on weekends, but anything is possible
2014-08-06 12:38:09	tamgc	o.O what're you breaking over the weekend?
2014-08-06 12:39:51	askore	:D
2014-08-06 12:42:42	Fetter	nothing
2014-08-06 12:43:08	Fetter	i'm bringing my daughter here to something called Geek Squad...it's actually in EB
2014-08-06 12:43:33	Fetter	so, i think it's just a drop off deal and i'm supposed to stay away after that
2014-08-06 12:44:17	Fetter	so, largely, i will be twiddling my thumbs while she nerds out on some sort of tech thing for kids
2014-08-06 12:45:07	askore	ah cool!
2014-08-06 12:45:12	Fetter	http://www.pdx.edu/cecs/geek-squad-academy
2014-08-06 12:52:14	Fetter	my daughter is just entering high school as a freshman and my son is three, he is going to a daycare around here
2014-08-06 12:52:41	Fetter	they both have tablets and both are nerds...
2014-08-06 12:52:44	Fetter	woot!
2014-08-06 12:53:33	Fetter	most of my scheduling snafu's is due to the childrens
2014-08-06 12:54:16	askore	childrens are pretty good at that I hear
2014-08-06 12:54:30	askore	but nerd kids \o/ need you to fix their computers less often than otherwise
2014-08-06 12:55:31	Fetter	yeah...it's not necessarily them though...their mothers' seem to have their own ideas about what my schedule should be and attempt to impose that on me often using the kids (not their fault, so i try not to make a big deal out of it)
2014-08-06 12:56:06	Fetter	this is, of course, despite being separated even...good times!  
2014-08-06 12:56:45	Fetter	it puts a bit a crimp on my socialness and nerdiness
2014-08-06 12:57:20	Fetter	i'm just trying to squeeze in some good ol' fashion gaming for some fun!  :-)
2014-08-06 13:00:55	Fetter	i'm waiting to hear on whether this evening is bust for me or not...i'll update here again once i know
2014-08-06 13:01:35	Fetter	however, it sounds like i would have time anytime between 9am & 4pm to game either Saturday or Sunday this weekend
2014-08-06 13:02:29	tamgc	Huh cool...like the concept, hate the fact that it's Geek Squad based =P
2014-08-06 13:02:43	Fetter	yeah...it's only sponsored by though
2014-08-06 13:03:04	Fetter	it looks like it's MESA that is doing it
2014-08-06 13:03:36	Fetter	i'm surprised a Geek Squad like thing even still exists these days
2014-08-06 13:04:15	Fetter	it doesn't seem like they would really be doing that great but maybe i'm sheltered?  ;-)
2014-08-06 13:04:43	tamgc	btw there's some other cool high school student things that tends to happen in EB...but I haven't really been paying attention to those things...other CATs might be better in tune
2014-08-06 13:05:28	tamgc	there'll always be less technically saavy folks looking for a chain-store solution
2014-08-06 13:05:47	tamgc	and paying extra...so not like they're not profiting enough to be able to do less heh
2014-08-06 13:06:43	Fetter	yeah, it seems like those less technical folks are being taken advantage of and that just doesn't sit well with me
2014-08-06 13:07:13	Fetter	my daughter has been to a couple other things here with MESA actually
2014-08-06 13:07:53	tamgc	ah nice
2014-08-06 13:08:45	tamgc	there's going to be a CAT Barcamp in Sept that may also be of interest heh
2014-08-06 13:09:48	Fetter	what's that?
2014-08-06 13:10:31	tamgc	there's cats, bars and camps >.>
2014-08-06 13:10:32	tamgc	http://catbarcamp.org/
2014-08-06 13:11:01	tamgc	barcamps are basically unconferences...
2014-08-06 13:12:30	tamgc	(basically barcamp was created as alternative to Foo Camps, an invite-only conf)
2014-08-06 13:12:53	tamgc	see also: http://beaverbarcamp.org/
2014-08-06 13:14:39	tamgc	tl;dr show up, propose talk in time slot, give talk; find talks that look interesting, attend talks =)
2014-08-06 13:16:23	Fetter	i think i was invited to that before actually
2014-08-06 13:19:54	Fetter	it's another one of those scheduling dilemmas for me
2014-08-06 13:19:56	Fetter	:-)
2014-08-06 13:30:55	tamgc	heh, if only you had time to make a time machine
2014-08-06 13:32:12	Fetter	or clones
2014-08-06 13:32:17	Fetter	hive mind clones, of course
2014-08-06 13:32:31	Fetter	i mean, what's the fun if i can't share the experiences with my other clones?
2014-08-06 13:55:51	tamgc	depends if the experiences are good or bad? heh
2014-08-06 14:10:34	Fetter	all experiences are good as long as something is learned.  ;-)
2014-08-06 14:10:55	tamgc	some things are better unlearned =)
2014-08-06 14:10:57	Fetter	of course, then the question is, was what was learned good or bad?
2014-08-06 14:11:27	Fetter	if didn't have things that we needed to unlearn, then what would we do with our lives?
2014-08-06 14:12:16	tamgc	I knew at one point, but I forget =)
2014-08-06 14:12:16	Fetter	isn't that the great life quest?  unlearning and then learning
2014-08-06 14:12:21	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-06 15:59:10	Fetter	doesn't look like i can make it back again this evening...sadly, wednesday's may not work out for me

2014-08-07 08:12:26	tamgc	ahh security w/ dabah
2014-08-07 08:12:29	tamgc	yeah probably
2014-08-07 08:13:41	askore	weird, support is getting a ton of spam lately
2014-08-07 08:14:22	tamgc	pretty sure it's from abuse@pdx.edu because everyone decided to fwd spam/phishing...
2014-08-07 08:14:47	tamgc	(or could just be moar spam=P)
2014-08-07 08:16:48	 *	askore un-knows
2014-08-07 08:17:12	askore	it says "via cat.pdx.edu"
2014-08-07 08:17:17	askore	so that's interesting
2014-08-07 08:17:22	askore	but otherwise no it's normal spam
2014-08-07 08:18:01	 *	askore thinks about that a few more times and realizes the via bit is not relevant
2014-08-07 08:19:54	tamgc	what do headers say?
2014-08-07 08:20:47	tamgc	maybe CAT mail infra has changed...and spam ass isn't catching them anymore
2014-08-07 08:21:57	askore	it's probably just new spam that spamassassin isn't getting to yet
2014-08-07 08:22:08	askore	I've seen it like the last two or three days
2014-08-07 08:59:31	Takua	urgghhhh
2014-08-07 08:59:38	Takua	I wanna be asleep
2014-08-07 08:59:41	askore	I agree
2014-08-07 09:03:11	stacybird	askore: aw maaaaaannn!

2014-08-07 09:03:22	stacybird	on the 13th at 2:15pm
2014-08-07 09:03:32	stacybird	I am presenting my final project for oss2014
2014-08-07 09:03:35	stacybird	:-(
2014-08-07 09:03:35	askore	yeaaaa
2014-08-07 09:03:39	askore	:P
2014-08-07 09:03:42	stacybird	no golfing at edgefield
2014-08-07 09:03:45	stacybird	MAN!
2014-08-07 09:03:53	stacybird	:-( :-( :-(

2014-08-07 09:03:58	stacybird	week after?
2014-08-07 09:04:03	stacybird	rainchecks?  :P
2014-08-07 09:04:11	askore	aye
2014-08-07 09:07:12	Fetter	so, i think i figured out plans to make it next wednesday and i think i can actually make it by 6pm instead of 7
2014-08-07 09:09:59	Fetter	i will also be on campus from 9-4 sat & sun, so if any gaming wishes to occur then that would be cool
2014-08-07 09:10:52	Fetter	otherwise, i will probably be reading over the new 5th ed starter set books and/or working on developing my own campaign
2014-08-07 09:11:30	Fetter	out of curiosity, what is everyone's favorite type of character to play?
2014-08-07 09:14:47	Fetter	i mostly like to play elves, halflings and humans, either as magic-users of some sort or roguish
2014-08-07 09:15:25	askore	I kind of flip-flop between warriors and healers
2014-08-07 09:16:42	Fetter	straight cleric type or do you ever go the druid route?
2014-08-07 09:17:07	askore	<3 druids
2014-08-07 09:17:29	Fetter	one of my epic chars was a druid
2014-08-07 09:24:52	Fetter	my four most memorable characters were a human wizard who eventually became a liche and had his own realm in Ravenloft, a druid who was merely trying to help but ended up being banished and labeled as a black human druid so he just went that route, a human paladin who was often put into moral dilemmas, and a halfling trickster (modeled after a kender) with a magical hoopak that did tricks of it's own
2014-08-07 09:26:03	askore	very nice
2014-08-07 09:26:24	askore	I always wish I played more tabletop games, since I always have a really nice time but don't tend to get very far in them
2014-08-07 09:26:28	askore	due to scheduling and stuff
2014-08-07 09:26:51	Fetter	sadly, i did not get to play my halfling trickster to it's fullest but that one was the most fun
2014-08-07 09:26:57	Fetter	yeah, scheduling is difficult
2014-08-07 09:27:01	stacybird	askore: are you golfing next wed?  if so you maybe too pooped for tabletop
2014-08-07 09:27:02	stacybird	:P
2014-08-07 09:27:05	askore	haha
2014-08-07 09:27:10	askore	stacybird: I doubt that that is true
2014-08-07 09:27:12	askore	>leave work
2014-08-07 09:27:18	askore	>hit up gas station for energy drink and snacks
2014-08-07 09:27:20	askore	>have fun

2014-08-07 09:27:40	askore	o/
2014-08-07 09:29:02	Fetter	i played with a group that had a set scheduled time that worked for everyone and we always met consistently for roughly 3-4 years
2014-08-07 09:29:12	Fetter	it's nice when you get a good core group like that
2014-08-07 09:30:10	tamgc	and sadly pretty rare
2014-08-07 09:31:23	Fetter	yeah...we all respected each others time because everyone had busy lives but wanted to squeeze in the gaming, thus, everyone was always on time and present so we could get our 3 hour game session in at it's fullest
2014-08-07 09:31:48	Fetter	we also had 3 out of the 6 were dm's
2014-08-07 09:31:57	Fetter	so, there were turns running and playing even
2014-08-07 09:32:02	Fetter	it was a pretty sweet group
2014-08-07 14:03:34	tamgc	nice

2014-08-08 18:54:27	tamgc	also 300 mg is actually about a 20/24 oz einstein coffee
2014-08-08 18:54:48	tamgc	100-150/8 oz
2014-08-08 18:58:48	askore	hehe

2014-08-09 11:19:45	relsqui	cool :) I think mancat's not going to be there until 3 so it can be a li'l later too

2014-08-10 13:45:51	Fetter	so, i read over the new 5th edition rules...they seem good...seems like we can just pretend 4th edition never existed

2014-08-10 14:30:05	Fetter	also fun!
2014-08-10 14:31:16	Fetter	it's especially fun when they get the robots distracted with the song
2014-08-10 14:31:26	Fetter	of course, batman is the most awesome!!!
2014-08-10 14:33:49	askore	haha

2014-08-10 14:37:35	@bajr	ya'll down for derpsing on wednesday?
2014-08-10 14:37:46	Fetter	i believe i am
2014-08-10 14:37:53	Fetter	i think i can even make it by 6ish
2014-08-10 14:38:06	Fetter	which would be good, because 7ish as a starting time is kind of late for me
2014-08-10 14:38:23	Fetter	i was just trying to make it fit
2014-08-10 14:39:07	Fetter	those smaller biped clones are so needy!  ;-)
2014-08-10 14:39:43	askore	I am fo sho
2014-08-10 14:40:29	Fetter	hopefully not so needy that you require somebody else to wipe your butt  ;-)
2014-08-10 14:40:39	Fetter	my three year old still requires that at times
2014-08-10 14:40:44	Fetter	:-(
2014-08-10 14:41:10	 *	bajr makes note to make fetter's character
2014-08-10 14:41:44	Fetter	we need a matrix implant chip that has data on it which informs them how to feed themselves, clean up after themselves and wipe their own butts
2014-08-10 14:42:08	Fetter	that would be a big hit on the market, i bet!
2014-08-10 14:42:11	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-10 14:45:39	Fetter	i'm pretty sure no parent ever enjoys wiping their child's butts...as a matter of fact, i'm fairly certain that if asked "did you enjoy wiping my butt as an infant?", the words, "oh yes, i enjoyed it very much...it was my favorite part".  the answer would more likely be a resounding, "NO!"  LOL
2014-08-10 14:45:40	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-10 14:46:31	 *	Fetter sings to self, "everything is awesome!..."
2014-08-10 14:47:06	Fetter	sorry, i just had a red bull and it made fly off my rocker  ;-)
2014-08-10 14:49:16	Fetter	on another topic, anybody know of a local steampunk outfitting shop?
2014-08-10 14:50:57	nibalizer	Fetter: etsy?
2014-08-10 14:51:12	Fetter	yeah, it's not local...i actually want to touch the things and stuff
2014-08-10 14:51:47	Fetter	i want to make sure it's a durable product and can withstand how i play with my toys
2014-08-10 14:51:50	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-10 14:52:09	 *	Fetter loves my winky faces
2014-08-10 14:52:54	Fetter	sometimes the product looks real nice, but then you find it can fall apart more easily than anticipated
2014-08-10 14:52:59	Fetter	it all depends on the crafter
2014-08-10 14:54:03	Fetter	i wish i could make my own because then i could just be completely anal-retentive about how the various items are constructed
2014-08-10 14:54:35	Fetter	i figure, we are in portland, there probably is some sort of shop?
2014-08-10 14:58:11	askore	Fetter: re feeding and wiping their own butts, that is exactly why my dad waited to be a stay-at-home parent until after my sister and I had some way of communicating what we wanted
2014-08-10 14:58:21	askore	because he wasn't willing to play the guessing game with a screaming baby
2014-08-10 15:01:25	Fetter	fortunately, my son doesn't scream too much...and, i'm actually fairly sensitive to the needs of the children...i'm more joking, except that changing poopies is really not fun at all
2014-08-10 15:01:28	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-10 15:03:15	Fetter	that said, communication is real nice
2014-08-10 15:03:18	Fetter	:-)
2014-08-10 15:06:24	askore	hahaha
2014-08-10 15:16:05	Fetter	speaking of communicating...i'm outta here for now...

2014-08-11 10:33:40	askore	lol
2014-08-11 10:34:22	askore	^ funniest thing ever is that when your animals give birth, all your dwarves do too

2014-08-11 10:34:39	jesusaurus	haha
2014-08-11 10:34:41	askore	so you embark with some animals
2014-08-11 10:34:44	askore	and some dwarves
2014-08-11 10:34:47	askore	presumably some of whom are female
2014-08-11 10:34:53	askore	the animals immediately pair off and get pregnant
2014-08-11 10:34:56	askore	....so do the dwarves

2014-08-11 10:35:59	askore	yup
2014-08-11 10:36:04	jesusaurus	ive never actually played, no
2014-08-11 10:36:06	Kraytul	I just wish the interface was less obtuse so it was tolerable to play
2014-08-11 10:36:08	askore	mhm
2014-08-11 10:36:09	jesusaurus	but im familiar with the game
2014-08-11 10:36:10	Kraytul	it's so great

2014-08-11 10:36:15	askore	I'm glad dwarf therapist is keeping up with the new releases
2014-08-11 10:36:23	askore	because it's unplayable without labor management
2014-08-11 10:36:37	Kraytul	oh nice.
2014-08-11 10:36:58	askore	on windows at least, the linux release claims to work but doesn't

2014-08-11 10:39:26	Kraytul	so the community could help.

2014-08-11 10:39:32	Kraytul	doesn't have to be everything
2014-08-11 10:39:34	askore	you know we would
2014-08-11 10:39:34	Kraytul	yeah
2014-08-11 10:39:41	Kraytul	just, so we could help make it excellent.
2014-08-11 10:39:45	askore	yup
2014-08-11 10:40:02	askore	I mean it's a free game but not open source
2014-08-11 10:40:04	askore	very frustrating
2014-08-11 10:40:08	Kraytul	yeah
2014-08-11 10:40:12	jesusaurus	but its definitely too large for github, it would need real infrastructure
2014-08-11 10:40:21	askore	I have no idea if he's planning on charging for it when it's complete and therefore doesn't want to hand out source or what
2014-08-11 10:40:23	askore	it's odd
2014-08-11 10:40:25	askore	yeah

2014-08-11 10:41:34	Kraytul	the game would just explode in popularity if he allowed anyone to help dev.
2014-08-11 10:42:03	Kraytul	just because all of those of us who like it but don't play... would dev and play

2014-08-12 09:22:17	Kraytul	:-\
2014-08-12 09:22:23	askore	aww
2014-08-12 09:22:23	Kraytul	What is the big deal about robin williams?
2014-08-12 09:22:43	Kraytul	He wasn't actively doing anything in the public sphere, how can you miss him?
2014-08-12 09:22:48	Kraytul	His presence hasn't changed AT ALL
2014-08-12 09:23:01	tamgc	Kraytul: a good guy that made a lot of things that made people happy
2014-08-12 09:23:09	Kraytul	and those things still can and will
2014-08-12 09:23:15	Kraytul	nothing has changed about it.
2014-08-12 09:23:28	tamgc	yes, but it always sucks when good people die
2014-08-12 09:23:58	Kraytul	There's no difference to just about anyone except his actual family whether he's alive or dead right now.
2014-08-12 09:24:17	tamgc	he's likely influenced people with the characters he's played over the years, and death basically means no more works from him as well
2014-08-12 09:24:34	Kraytul	Were there planned to be more works from him?
2014-08-12 09:24:39	tamgc	no idea
2014-08-12 09:24:43	tamgc	but the potential is gone now
2014-08-12 09:25:21	tamgc	chances are, like most comedians, he was probably going sets in various venues
2014-08-12 09:25:24	Kraytul	Robin williams is not special, was not special.
2014-08-12 09:25:35	Kraytul	He was a guy, he had drug problems and mental health issues, and he killed himself
2014-08-12 09:25:43	tamgc	special enough to enough people that they care about his death
2014-08-12 09:25:57	Kraytul	It shouldn't matter that he was famour or that there was comedy he performed for people, because people didn't care about problems before he died
2014-08-12 09:26:01	Kraytul	then they don't care about him
2014-08-12 09:26:14	Kraytul	If you dont' care before someone's dead, caring after they're dead is silly.
2014-08-12 09:26:32	tamgc	yes, but doesn't mean everyone didn't care about him, and weren't effected by him
2014-08-12 09:26:48	Kraytul	not continually
2014-08-12 09:26:51	Kraytul	just instantially
2014-08-12 09:26:57	tamgc	Yes.  That's life.
2014-08-12 09:26:58	Kraytul	and those effects continue to be possible and present.
2014-08-12 09:27:08	Kraytul	so his death doesn't affect them
2014-08-12 09:27:10	tamgc	to a certain degree, yes.
2014-08-12 09:27:21	Kraytul	just whatever selfish claim they want to have over ways they could draw from him more in the future
2014-08-12 09:27:25	tamgc	there's this thing called emotions and empathy
2014-08-12 09:27:29	Kraytul	it stops people from having the idea that they could take more.
2014-08-12 09:27:29	tamgc	most people have that
2014-08-12 09:27:42	Kraytul	I empathize with a man who committed suicide
2014-08-12 09:28:02	tamgc	so why can't others empathize?
2014-08-12 09:28:03	Kraytul	I think it's unfair for anyone saying they are sad he's gone who didn't care before they found out he was dead.
2014-08-12 09:28:10	Kraytul	it's not empathy
2014-08-12 09:28:12	Kraytul	it's self-pity
2014-08-12 09:28:18	Kraytul	"oh I'll not get to witness more of this person"
2014-08-12 09:28:23	Kraytul	it's self-focused
2014-08-12 09:28:27	tamgc	empathy would trigger sadness
2014-08-12 09:28:29	Kraytul	it's emotional masturbation.
2014-08-12 09:28:39	Kraytul	There's no empathy in it!
2014-08-12 09:28:47	tamgc	you say that like masturbation is bad =P
2014-08-12 09:28:57	tamgc	so you say
2014-08-12 09:29:13	Kraytul	what part of it is anything but self-satisfaction?
2014-08-12 09:29:37	tamgc	(I don't doubt a lot of people are jumping on the train, but that doesn't mean there are people that genuinely care)
2014-08-12 09:29:41	Kraytul	It's not empathy, it's disrespectful to people who did care about him.
2014-08-12 09:30:00	Kraytul	and the people who did care about him aren't jumping up and talking about it
2014-08-12 09:30:00	tamgc	people feel emotions, deal with it
2014-08-12 09:30:14	tamgc	Conan did
2014-08-12 09:30:21	Kraytul	the big thing is that people aren't feeling emotions about it.
2014-08-12 09:30:25	Kraytul	they're speaking words
2014-08-12 09:30:27	Kraytul	just like mandella
2014-08-12 09:30:52	Kraytul	paying lipservice to something they want to pretend to care about but won't actually take any action about.
2014-08-12 09:30:58	tamgc	no, most people have emotional reactions when icons die
2014-08-12 09:31:45	Kraytul	I would say that a vanishingly small number of people who 'care' about him dying actually care about a real person
2014-08-12 09:31:49	Kraytul	because a real person killed themselves
2014-08-12 09:32:01	Kraytul	and the fake person in entertainment still exists regardless
2014-08-12 09:32:12	Kraytul	but they feel sad because the fake person won't exist for them anymore
2014-08-12 09:32:14	Kraytul	that's sick.
2014-08-12 09:32:31	tamgc	or they care that the person who was behind those works are gone
2014-08-12 09:33:01	Kraytul	but they don't
2014-08-12 09:33:09	Kraytul	because screenwriters and props people die all the time
2014-08-12 09:33:15	Kraytul	and nobody makes a peep.
2014-08-12 09:33:19	tamgc	the emotional link might be initially from the person, but it could have spread, can't say for certain
2014-08-12 09:33:32	Kraytul	also
2014-08-12 09:33:34	Kraytul	he killed himself.
2014-08-12 09:33:36	tamgc	there are people that care about those people as well
2014-08-12 09:33:41	tamgc	yes
2014-08-12 09:34:03	Kraytul	nobody's talking about depression
2014-08-12 09:34:10	tamgc	he had issues, and at the very least his death will bring the discussion of suicide up for a while
2014-08-12 09:34:15	Kraytul	maybe
2014-08-12 09:34:17	Kraytul	except it isn't
2014-08-12 09:34:20	dom	tons of people are talking about depression
2014-08-12 09:34:21	tamgc	it's been a day
2014-08-12 09:34:39	tamgc	and people are talking about depression, and are asking people to seek help
2014-08-12 09:34:41	dom	also, the whole point of emotions is that yours are different from other peoples'
2014-08-12 09:34:44	Kraytul	it's been a day of people vapidly hopping on the "mourn the celbrety" bandwagon
2014-08-12 09:34:45	tamgc	if they're feeling the same

2014-08-12 09:34:56	tamgc	also, apparently AA meeting numbers went up
2014-08-12 09:35:19	tamgc	everyone feels things differently
2014-08-12 09:35:26	Kraytul	why can't we make a fanfare for when a vetran kills himself?
2014-08-12 09:35:38	tamgc	some people do
2014-08-12 09:35:40	dom	because they aren't worldwide famous?
2014-08-12 09:35:43	Kraytul	why aren't we mourning the wars we have going?
2014-08-12 09:35:49	tamgc	they're not as widely known, so that's why
2014-08-12 09:35:55	tamgc	some people do
2014-08-12 09:35:59	Kraytul	they're known the same
2014-08-12 09:36:04	dom	not really
2014-08-12 09:36:16	dom	I can name some of the vets I know of, but I can't name a ton
2014-08-12 09:36:20	tamgc	no, you can't mourn what you're not aware of
2014-08-12 09:36:25	Kraytul	you know a character.
2014-08-12 09:36:28	Kraytul	you don't know a person.
2014-08-12 09:36:34	Kraytul	you know the people the same.
2014-08-12 09:36:38	Kraytul	they're effectively anonymous
2014-08-12 09:36:49	tamgc	other than the fact that people take up interest in the person outside of the character as well
2014-08-12 09:36:52	Kraytul	the only way you know them is by a self-serving link to pretend you're affected.
2014-08-12 09:37:07	Kraytul	to pretend you're involved..
2014-08-12 09:37:12	dom	guess what, its an issue, thats what happens
2014-08-12 09:37:12	Kraytul	life by proxy
2014-08-12 09:37:24	Kraytul	dom: I'm not in denial
2014-08-12 09:37:24	tamgc	life by proxy is how most people live anyways
2014-08-12 09:37:27	Kraytul	I think it's gross.
2014-08-12 09:37:39	dom	its not gonna change by you telling anyone about it
2014-08-12 09:37:58	Kraytul	dom: do you think I expect it to?
2014-08-12 09:38:05	Kraytul	as was said, we've all got opinions.
2014-08-12 09:38:06	dom	well, isn't that your point?
2014-08-12 09:38:13	dom	people talk about an issue, nothing happens
2014-08-12 09:38:16	Kraytul	not everything is pointed.
2014-08-12 09:39:36	tamgc	then I guess the reason for bringing it up is self-serving =P
2014-08-12 09:40:01	Kraytul	It was in response to other things posted in this, what is in fact, chatroom
2014-08-12 09:41:04	tamgc	it either had a point or didn't, you were stating something for a reason
2014-08-12 09:41:38	Kraytul	My reason is to say something.

2014-08-12 15:08:29	askore	*haha
2014-08-12 15:08:47	askore	more probably, until schedules changed and we can't find a common meeting time
2014-08-12 15:09:08	sabreman_work	hopefully atleast till fall term.
2014-08-12 15:09:13	@bajr	yeah something like that
2014-08-12 15:09:28	sabreman_work	I hope that we can continue after wards, but it'll be super hard to find a good time
2014-08-12 15:10:16	askore	ugh I just want to refactor this entire repository, but I need to fix the code first.....
2014-08-12 15:10:57	sabreman_work	you could always refactor first. Who knows you might end up fixing as you go
2014-08-12 15:11:09	askore	neh I have to add code in order to fix it
2014-08-12 15:11:16	askore	and the refactor is....
2014-08-12 15:11:26	askore	well I need a testing workflow for that to happen
2014-08-12 15:11:35	askore	and the meeting required for that to happen is on thursday
2014-08-12 15:11:42	askore	(this will probably not happen before my internship runs out)

2014-08-13 09:33:11	tamgc	ah, annoy away then -.-
2014-08-13 09:38:07	askore	...too many package managers
2014-08-13 09:38:45	@bajr	obviously we need to make a new package manager so that nobody has to use so many package managers
2014-08-13 09:39:19	tamgc	but you'd also want to have the other package managers available from your package manager, since you don't want to limit users' options
2014-08-13 09:39:58	askore	keep trying to run pacman -Ss on ubuntu boxes
2014-08-13 09:40:20	Fetter	we just need a new standard for package managers, you know something to go with all the other standards
2014-08-13 09:40:48	askore	I just need to keep my brain in line, I don't mind about it normally
2014-08-13 09:40:55	askore	too much context switching today

2014-08-13 09:49:56	tamgc	*sigh* n00b, that's always something you need to know before you need it >.> <.<
2014-08-13 09:50:42	askore	tamgc: that would make it premeditated though
2014-08-13 09:51:10	tamgc	(also Florida...so not too surprised...)
2014-08-13 09:51:27	tamgc	seems like Florida/Arizona tends to be the head-desky states -.-
2014-08-13 09:52:06	tamgc	askore: yeah...if you're trying to hide a body, not sure if that'll make much of a difference...
2014-08-13 09:54:20	@bajr	yeah, hiding the body is generally a Bad Thing, but they'll still give you a longer sentence for premeditated murder
2014-08-13 10:04:01	tamgc	yep
2014-08-13 10:04:31	tamgc	but they don't need to know that you've thought about it...
2014-08-13 10:05:03	tamgc	(was thinking not right before you do it, just random thought excercise >.>)

2014-08-13 11:01:09	@bajr	nah, uranium's an alpha decay, so your hands should be fine.... so long as you make sure to wash your hands very thoroughly afterwards and avoid breathing any of the dust
2014-08-13 11:02:35	@bajr	and then keep the dice sealed in something air tight when not in use
2014-08-13 11:06:24	tamgc	ooh you can make some uranium glitter...

2014-08-13 12:15:10	@bajr	Fox: you didn't just walk in here... you've been here for months!
2014-08-13 12:21:10	Fox	bajr: Are you implying my long strides can't carry me across IRC channels without getting wet toes?
2014-08-13 12:26:13	@bajr	Fox: indeed! your stature makes you present at *all* locations
2014-08-13 12:27:20	Fox	...
2014-08-13 12:27:26	 *	Fox 's is omnipresent.
2014-08-13 12:27:38	 *	Fox is tyop.
2014-08-13 12:27:56	@bajr	omnipresent would be an interesting ability
2014-08-13 12:28:12	Fox	Sounds really frustrating for the GM and the player
2014-08-13 12:28:13	@bajr	kinda useless without omniscience though...
2014-08-13 12:28:30	Fox	It's the kind of thing that makes the player go
2014-08-13 12:28:36	Fox	"I'm never playing a divination wizard again."
2014-08-13 12:28:43	@bajr	omnipresence would simply lead to sensory overload
2014-08-13 12:31:02	Fox	Depends. Extremely powerful beings may be okay.
2014-08-13 12:31:09	Fox	Demon lords, demiliches, and so forth.
2014-08-13 12:31:28	Fox	But Joe Greybeard, your Human Wizard 4?

2014-08-13 13:02:16	relsqui	nice
2014-08-13 13:02:25	tamgc	like while on the river Monday, it would've been nice to have, but hadn't added a stampede string to it yet...so that would've been sad

2014-08-14 08:25:10	@bajr	yep
2014-08-14 08:25:12	askore	nightfly++
2014-08-14 08:25:55	tamgc	Fetter: ayep
2014-08-14 08:26:06	askore	caffeine maybe
2014-08-14 08:26:14	tamgc	link-bot: help, I need somebody
2014-08-14 08:26:19	askore	I could go upstairs and get caffeine and food
2014-08-14 08:26:35	Fetter	i'm making coffee now....mmmmm
2014-08-14 08:27:13	tamgc	(you're welcome for the earworm=))
2014-08-14 08:27:28	Fetter	fresh ground italian roast, my favorite!
2014-08-14 08:28:51	askore	tamgc: nope, I already had a song stuck in my head
2014-08-14 08:30:04	tamgc	just a different genus of earworm, also acceptable
2014-08-14 08:37:19	Fetter	that's it!  roll for initiative, tamgc
2014-08-14 08:37:22	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-14 08:37:42	 *	askore is looking forward to internship ending and having time off
2014-08-14 08:40:53	 *	tamgc slightly surprised there's no dice rolling bot in here..
2014-08-14 08:41:03	askore	that IS surprising
2014-08-14 08:41:06	 *	askore wants to make that now
2014-08-14 08:42:53	tamgc	doooo eeeettt
2014-08-14 08:43:18	askore	hmmm, what other things should it be able to do?
2014-08-14 08:43:32	askore	as far as tabletop-centric utilities
2014-08-14 08:43:34	Fetter	random crazy result description
2014-08-14 08:44:41	tamgc	name generator, NPC generator... *generator
2014-08-14 08:44:51	tamgc	(power generator... >.> <.<)
2014-08-14 08:45:26	 *	askore will pull from http://www.seventhsanctum.com/ then
2014-08-14 08:48:27	Fetter	it should also respond to DC## (i.e. askore attempts to wake up, roll DC10)
2014-08-14 08:49:41	askore	what's the DC stand for?
2014-08-14 08:50:17	tamgc	detective comics, or difficulty check
2014-08-14 08:50:22	askore	ah
2014-08-14 08:50:30	Fetter	difficulty class
2014-08-14 08:50:30	tamgc	more of d20/D&D thing
2014-08-14 08:50:36	Fetter	yeah
2014-08-14 08:50:38	tamgc	oh class >.>
2014-08-14 08:50:48	tamgc	(vs armor class)
2014-08-14 08:51:21	Fetter	it's a class because the number represents the class of difficulty (i.e. easy, medium or hard)
2014-08-14 08:51:38	tamgc	ahh
2014-08-14 08:51:47	Fetter	so, it's a class of difficulty
2014-08-14 08:52:05	Fetter	with the number itself being a grey area of meaning
2014-08-14 08:52:18	Fetter	then you roll a check against an action
2014-08-14 08:52:48	Fetter	like, tamgc looks up what DC means on google, DC10
2014-08-14 08:53:16	 *	tamgc would roll a 9 =)
2014-08-14 08:53:40	askore	oh right, so you have to beat the number listed?
2014-08-14 08:53:47	Fetter	you could have character modifiers as well, so you might be smart and/or have points in skill investigate or research then it would be DC10+7
2014-08-14 08:53:58	Fetter	or wait, no...need coffee
2014-08-14 08:54:02	askore	lol
2014-08-14 08:54:04	Fetter	the roll result would be +7
2014-08-14 08:54:07	askore	aha
2014-08-14 08:54:22	Fetter	so, in your example, if you rolled a 9, it would be 9 + 7
2014-08-14 08:54:28	Fetter	which beats DC10
2014-08-14 08:54:35	 *	tamgc 's modifiers are negatives >.>
2014-08-14 08:54:50	Fetter	it's a special character flaw
2014-08-14 08:54:52	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-14 08:55:03	tamgc	indeed
2014-08-14 08:55:08	Fetter	you get some uber power for that flaw though
2014-08-14 08:55:37	askore	so then "DC10" to the bot would be 
2014-08-14 08:55:58	askore	er
2014-08-14 08:56:04	 *	askore lost wifi for a moment
2014-08-14 08:56:42	 *	tamgc has all his skillpoints dumped in "Use Magic Device" -.-
2014-08-14 08:57:09	Fetter	the bot rolls d20, if the result of the roll is 10 or greater then task succeeds, otherwise 9 or less fails, with a 20 being a super success and 1 being a major fail
2014-08-14 08:57:30	tamgc	depends on the system
2014-08-14 08:58:00	tamgc	iirc some you can't crit on a skillcheck
2014-08-14 08:58:06	Fetter	then you could parse the initial bits, like "askore attempts to wake up" and be like, "rolls 11: askore wakes up"
2014-08-14 08:58:39	Fetter	or "rolls 1: askore moves head upward, bonks self on head, doesn't fight it and falls back asleep for three days"
2014-08-14 08:58:48	askore	lol
2014-08-14 08:59:01	askore	the description would be much more difficult
2014-08-14 08:59:10	Fetter	or "rolls 20: askore wakes up without any caffeine but feels super energized"
2014-08-14 08:59:16	Fetter	indeed
2014-08-14 08:59:27	tamgc	need to be able to factor in modifiers
2014-08-14 08:59:29	Fetter	but the results would be fun
2014-08-14 08:59:42	tamgc	hungry cat +10 modifier =P
2014-08-14 08:59:45	Fetter	yes, and then let's complicate it by somehow allowing for modifiers
2014-08-14 08:59:50	askore	could have some random works-in-most-situations descriptions
2014-08-14 08:59:58	askore	but specific ones for the task attempted would be hard
2014-08-14 08:59:59	tamgc	(no more difficult than descriptions heh)
2014-08-14 09:00:22	askore	no modifiers are easy as long as you have a syntax for indicating them
2014-08-14 09:01:03	Fetter	modifiers would be something that would follow up though
2014-08-14 09:01:12	askore	I see
2014-08-14 09:01:32	Fetter	so, like, i say, "askore attempts to wake up, DC15",
2014-08-14 09:01:46	Fetter	then you reply and say, "i have +3 to wake up skill"
2014-08-14 09:02:07	Fetter	then it rolls and results with 14+3, which means you wake up 
2014-08-14 09:02:23	askore	but you could also say DC-3
2014-08-14 09:02:25	askore	er
2014-08-14 09:02:27	askore	DC15-3
2014-08-14 09:02:34	Fetter	yeah, but i don't know what your stats are
2014-08-14 09:02:47	askore	but I replied before you rolled
2014-08-14 09:02:50	Fetter	so, it wouldn't be right for me to dictate your modifer
2014-08-14 09:04:35	Fetter	for now, it just starts out with having a result for the word "roll"
2014-08-14 09:04:41	Fetter	that's a d20
2014-08-14 09:05:26	Fetter	we could always make up the rest
2014-08-14 09:05:28	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-14 09:05:41	Fetter	later you can improve upon it and add in new stuff
2014-08-14 09:05:47	askore	yeah, seems like the easiest and most flexible way would still be to say "roll 1d20"
2014-08-14 09:05:49	Fetter	like random results
2014-08-14 09:06:16	Fetter	oh, sure...you could make it just roll any ##d##
2014-08-14 09:06:21	Fetter	that would be even more fun
2014-08-14 09:06:41	Fetter	then you could roll 11d12
2014-08-14 09:06:46	askore	lol
2014-08-14 09:06:48	askore	yeah
2014-08-14 09:06:57	Fetter	against baby dragon
2014-08-14 09:07:03	askore	poor babby dragon
2014-08-14 09:07:16	Fetter	yeah, except 11d12 only scratched it
2014-08-14 09:07:22	Fetter	now it's baby dragon's turn
2014-08-14 09:08:08	Fetter	baby dragon calls to mom & dad dragons, roll 1d20
2014-08-14 09:08:24	Fetter	and mom & dad dragons come, now you're not in good shape
2014-08-14 09:08:47	askore	heh
2014-08-14 09:08:50	Fetter	i hope you prepared teleport
2014-08-14 09:08:51	Fetter	;-)
2014-08-14 09:14:34	 *	askore grumbles and hunts for food + caffeine
2014-08-14 09:15:16	 *	stacybird wants to play dwarf fortress
2014-08-14 09:16:59	tamgc	And here we have the wild askore, having waken from her slumber, goes hunting for food. <Attenborough>

2014-08-14 09:19:35	askore	I woke from slumber like four hours ago :/
2014-08-14 09:20:23	askore	which is part of the problem I guess
2014-08-14 09:20:25	askore	stacybird: I agree
2014-08-14 09:20:28	askore	about the df

2014-08-14 09:27:39	 *	askore also is not affected because own laptop
2014-08-14 09:30:49	 *	askore also requires music
2014-08-14 09:31:04	askore	too many people in here today, it's loud
2014-08-14 09:31:11	askore	stacybird: want fruit?

2014-08-14 09:32:52	stacybird	(prince of persia)++
2014-08-14 09:33:20	askore	lol
2014-08-14 09:33:33	Fetter	i like this: http://somafm.com/
2014-08-14 09:33:34	link-bot	SomaFM: Listener Supported, Commercial Free Internet Radio (http://goo.gl/cmuf)
2014-08-14 09:33:46	Fetter	it has a couple things that have soundtracks
2014-08-14 09:33:59	 *	stacybird had bought a pandora acct
2014-08-14 09:34:02	Fetter	i'm currently listening to groove salad
2014-08-14 09:34:06	stacybird	because sountracks
2014-08-14 09:34:09	stacybird	and work
2014-08-14 09:34:11	stacybird	:-)
2014-08-14 09:34:17	Fetter	does buying a pandora account do anything extra?
2014-08-14 09:34:22	stacybird	YES!
2014-08-14 09:34:23	stacybird	no ads
2014-08-14 09:34:28	stacybird	more skipping
2014-08-14 09:34:34	stacybird	and more stations
2014-08-14 09:34:36	stacybird	and things
2014-08-14 09:34:38	stacybird	:-)
2014-08-14 09:34:48	Fetter	more stations would potentially be interesting
2014-08-14 09:34:48	stacybird	its like.... $4 a month?
2014-08-14 09:35:11	stacybird	and you can stop at any point, it seems to keep your data on created stations
2014-08-14 09:35:26	stacybird	which is neat
2014-08-14 09:35:32	stacybird	I like streaming music sans ads
2014-08-14 09:35:39	stacybird	I will pay $4 a month for 0 ads
2014-08-14 09:35:47	stacybird	and music I've never heard
2014-08-14 09:42:56	Fetter	yeah...i seem to be mostly happy with it as-is, but if i used pandora more, i might want no ads
2014-08-14 18:29:17	 *	bajr headscratch.
2014-08-14 18:29:22	@bajr	you guys get ads on pandora?
2014-08-14 18:29:55	dom	I use pandora pretty extensively and don't notice the ads
2014-08-14 18:30:32	 *	bajr has adblock on his chrome, so maybe doesn't get them.
2014-08-14 18:30:46	dom	I have adblock, still get them

2014-08-18 18:57:51	askore	mostly unrelated
2014-08-18 18:58:00	askore	but hanging out with people and being goofy when it's hot and muggy is better

2014-08-19 07:58:24	askore	lol
2014-08-19 07:58:32	askore	or they couldn't figure out what was wrong
2014-08-19 07:58:42	askore	anyway I can't even check email so \o/

2014-08-19 07:59:09	tamgc	oh hah...internal issue...
2014-08-19 07:59:13	askore	yeah
2014-08-19 07:59:24	tamgc	could be a hardware issue and waiting on parts
2014-08-19 07:59:42	askore	yeah, and it would be nice to have an update about that, but the network is down so I can't read email
2014-08-19 07:59:57	tamgc	heh
2014-08-19 08:00:14	askore	today might be another very short day.

2014-08-19 08:01:41	stormcrow	'cause ADP handles paychecks for Rentrak
2014-08-19 08:01:45	askore	stormcrow: I don't think so
2014-08-19 08:01:52	askore	also I think it's just my department
2014-08-19 08:02:03	askore	this is dealer services
2014-08-19 08:02:06	askore	not that ^ side of the company
2014-08-19 08:02:08	askore	so no
2014-08-19 08:02:14	tamgc	hopefully they don't serve things in their office building...
2014-08-19 08:02:14	stormcrow	Oh, good
2014-08-19 08:02:20	askore	that too
2014-08-19 08:02:23	tamgc	but for all we know, it could be some desktop system
2014-08-19 08:02:25	askore	there's no data center here
2014-08-19 08:02:35	askore	(just some very impressive "labs")
2014-08-19 08:03:17	tamgc	meh, only impressive labs are well behaved ones >.>
2014-08-19 08:03:38	askore	the point is the big lab is almost as big as psu's COLO
2014-08-19 08:03:56	askore	the little lab is as big as the cat's part of the DC
2014-08-19 08:03:57	tamgc	(/me prefers playing with dogs over looking at shiny equipment =P)
2014-08-19 08:04:00	askore	lol
2014-08-19 08:04:02	askore	yeah
2014-08-19 08:04:05	askore	dogs are good too
2014-08-19 08:04:53	tamgc	ooh...if I get a lab, I think I'd name it "science"...so it'll be a science lab and can yell "SCIENCE!"
2014-08-19 08:05:02	askore	lol
2014-08-19 08:05:13	askore	even if the way it pronounces "science" sounds like "bark"
2014-08-19 08:05:53	tamgc	>.> <.<
2014-08-19 08:12:57	 *	tamgc would just need one of those collars from Up
2014-08-19 11:09:31	relsqui	you can yell science at it, that's pretty good too
2014-08-19 11:30:41	tamgc	relsqui: heh yeah, that was the original intent of the sentence, but structure-wise left room for interpretation >.> (hence askore's joke...I think?)
2014-08-19 11:31:02	askore	lol
2014-08-19 11:31:09	askore	yes
2014-08-19 11:31:14	askore	or something
2014-08-19 11:34:41	tamgc	oof... /me needs to remember to not horseback ride for 2hrs next time -.- although oddly enough my back's more sore than I'd expected...
2014-08-19 11:35:35	tamgc	also makes you wonder how rodeo riders aren't limping all the time
2014-08-19 11:36:09	askore	that's why cowboys look bow-legged
2014-08-19 11:36:47	tamgc	heh guess that's the cowboy version of limping?
2014-08-19 11:36:54	askore	lol
2014-08-19 11:37:09	 *	tamgc always figure that's just riding's version of sea-legs
2014-08-19 11:38:35	tamgc	also random tidbit I learned, uphill is actually easier than downhill -.-
2014-08-19 11:39:09	tamgc	not sure why I didn't expect that, makes sense in hindsight
2014-08-19 11:39:22	askore	yeah
2014-08-19 11:42:08	tamgc	good times still
2014-08-19 11:50:46	relsqui	hm, 202 final grade was posted and then removed on d2l, possibly was in the regular grading pile but wasn't actually supposed to be posted there (because I'm not in the course :P)
2014-08-19 11:50:55	relsqui	or else it was accidentally someone else's I guess
2014-08-19 11:51:12	relsqui	but assuming it was mine it was an 81%, which is not great but good enough afaik

2014-08-19 15:26:47	mancat	i feel like nano parties are made of a lot of people sitting in silence with laptops and headphones, drinking coffee and listening to techo, and involve absolutely no itneraction whatsoever
2014-08-19 15:26:52	mancat	parallel play
2014-08-19 15:26:54	mancat	but still
2014-08-19 15:26:58	Takua	More or less, yeah
2014-08-19 15:27:10	Takua	although my last nano party was "Let's head to the beach for the weekend"
2014-08-19 15:27:14	Takua	...in November, yes
2014-08-19 15:27:16	askore	lol
2014-08-19 15:27:18	askore	amaze
2014-08-19 15:27:24	Takua	It was pretty good
2014-08-19 15:27:32	 *	askore really wants to run away from work and do something more interesting
2014-08-19 15:27:38	askore	theoretically I should find my coworker first
2014-08-19 15:27:40	mancat	relsqui: i didn't mean it like that. i'm just trying to offer a reminder that you would probably be better off forgetting about it and moving on.
2014-08-19 15:27:40	 *	Takua agrees with askore
2014-08-19 15:27:46	 *	Takua has a meeting in 33 minutes
2014-08-19 15:27:56	mancat	but it's your choice, just trying to be helpful
2014-08-19 15:28:12	mancat	is it cheating to start nano early?
2014-08-19 15:28:12	 *	Takua tried to flee!  But it failed...
2014-08-19 15:28:23	Takua	It's cheating to start, not cheating to plan ahead
2014-08-19 15:28:44	relsqui	mancat: I don't think ignoring conflict is always the right response to it.
2014-08-19 15:29:20	relsqui	also, while it's absolutely cheating to start writing nano early, that doesn't make it a bad idea to do a bunch of writing over your summer break when, unlike in november, you actually have the time :P
2014-08-19 15:29:29	mancat	:P yeah
2014-08-19 15:30:32	mancat	i don't feel like engaging in arguments is pointful unless the other party is rational enough to hear your point. that wasn't the impression i got from what you reposted
2014-08-19 15:30:45	relsqui	I actually disagree with that! but only when the argument is public
2014-08-19 15:30:51	mancat	fair enough
2014-08-19 15:31:01	relsqui	I think there's value in being visible about "this abuse is happening" and "I don't agree with what that person is saying"
2014-08-19 15:31:09	relsqui	there are other participants than me and this person
2014-08-19 15:31:12	relsqui	otherwise I would agree, yeah
2014-08-19 15:32:15	mancat	:( lizard has gone 26B and left me with the stupid windows host :(

2014-08-19 15:33:33	mancat	Ant is on it
2014-08-19 15:33:46	mancat	26B means sunray won't talk to SUNWut service

2014-08-19 15:40:07	@bajr	i bought some miniatures
2014-08-19 15:40:11	mancat	oh man bajr
2014-08-19 15:40:13	@bajr	we can use them on the map thing
2014-08-19 15:40:15	mancat	oh manbajr
2014-08-19 15:40:23	@bajr	they'll look so pretty when I paint them

2014-08-19 15:40:55	jesusaurus	miniatures?
2014-08-19 15:41:00	mancat	skin hacks for IRL
2014-08-19 15:41:06	jesusaurus	i usually just use lego people
2014-08-19 15:41:06	@bajr	mancat: i refuse to be a manbajr, for i am bajrman!

2014-08-19 15:41:28	jesusaurus	a man of a bajr; a bajr of a man
2014-08-19 15:41:34	@bajr	jesusaurus: lego would work too, but I have a soft spot in my heart for painting miniatures
2014-08-19 15:41:45	mancat	bajrman: a bajr among men.
2014-08-19 15:43:10	@bajr	see also: bajr's $800 collection of warhammer 40k toy space-elves
2014-08-19 15:43:47	jesusaurus	what? no space-orcs?
2014-08-19 15:43:53	@bajr	sadly no
2014-08-19 15:43:56	askore	a bajr among men, or a man among bajrs?
2014-08-19 15:44:27	jesusaurus	askore: why not both?
2014-08-19 15:44:57	askore	probably both
2014-08-19 15:45:23	@bajr	possibly neither
2014-08-19 15:47:03	mancat	almost certainly not neither
2014-08-19 15:55:27	relsqui	mfw someone tries to insult me by claiming they "couldn't tell I was a woman"
2014-08-19 15:55:35	relsqui	it is completely hilarious how misguided that is
2014-08-19 15:56:58	relsqui	like, you need to get several facts wrong in order for that to mean what you want it to mean
2014-08-19 16:23:41	jesusaurus	"you dont seem like a woman <grumpface>" "thanks! <smiling>"
2014-08-19 16:23:53	relsqui	right?
2014-08-19 16:24:14	relsqui	I mean, I wouldn't say thanks either, 'cause I wouldn't want to imply there's anything wrong with looking like a woman, in general :P
2014-08-19 16:24:50	relsqui	it's just interesting because the insult relies on the assumption that we have matching social values in this regard
2014-08-19 16:30:32	@bajr	possible comeback: "You don't seem like a gentleman." May or may not shut him up for a bit
2014-08-19 16:33:45	relsqui	oh, I think that had zero chance of shutting him up
2014-08-19 16:33:47	relsqui	and I've stopped engaging
2014-08-19 16:34:19	@bajr	good plan
2014-08-19 16:34:24	jesusaurus	or maybe "tsk tsk, thats not a very lady-like thing to say"

2014-08-19 16:47:56	@bajr	^ Wanted this sticker for a little while, haven't been able to justify it yet, though
2014-08-19 16:48:57	askore	what's the latin say?
2014-08-19 16:49:37	nightfly	red bubble would be better if the shipping wasn't so expensive
2014-08-19 16:51:12	@bajr	Sweeter after Difficulties... *mumblemumble*
2014-08-19 16:51:46	relsqui	ad nauseum
2014-08-19 16:51:54	relsqui	... is hard to translate, because in english when we want to say that phrase we use the latin
2014-08-19 16:51:58	relsqui	I mean, it's literally "until nausea"
2014-08-19 16:52:07	askore	ah?
2014-08-19 16:52:08	relsqui	but "for an arbitrarily long time" is closer
2014-08-19 16:52:08	@bajr	right, but no idea how it formulates into the sentence, and I suspect it's bad latin
2014-08-19 16:52:11	askore	I'd say "until you're sick of it"
2014-08-19 16:52:18	relsqui	yeah, that's p. good
2014-08-19 16:52:21	askore	yeah it's the first part I couldn't figure
2014-08-19 16:53:10	relsqui	I think it's just some latin bits strung together to be latiny :P
2014-08-19 16:53:13	relsqui	the individual bits are okay
2014-08-19 16:53:14	askore	hehe
2014-08-19 16:53:57	askore	I'm suddenly reminded of this: http://problemglyphs.org/
2014-08-19 16:54:08	askore	it was discussed quite a bit in another channel but most of y'all aren't in that channel
2014-08-19 16:54:22	askore	(kinda nsfw)
2014-08-19 16:55:17	relsqui	huh neat
2014-08-19 16:55:58	@bajr	huh, friend of mine says the literal translation is "out of the continued rough (implied) comes the sweet"
2014-08-19 16:56:09	relsqui	oh nice
2014-08-19 16:56:11	relsqui	shows what we know
2014-08-19 16:56:31	askore	huh interesting
2014-08-19 16:56:53	askore	it seems kind of in the wrong order but maybe I put the parentheses in the wrong place
2014-08-19 16:59:06	relsqui	word order isn't semantic in latin
2014-08-19 16:59:34	relsqui	it uses suffixes for grammar heavily enough that you can rearrange the words basically arbitrarily
2014-08-19 16:59:44	relsqui	I think there are some exceptions to that but it's definitely much, much less ordered than english
2014-08-19 17:10:29	jesusaurus	as a rule of thumb, latin ends thoughts (aka periods) with verbs. but this is often purposefully not the case in latin poetry
2014-08-19 17:12:03	askore	huh
2014-08-19 17:12:12	 *	askore has escaped and is foraging for food
2014-08-19 17:16:08	jesusaurus	thats an interesting phrase... 
2014-08-19 17:17:36	@bajr	jesusaurus: how so?
2014-08-19 17:17:48	jesusaurus	bajr: i think a more literal translation would be "sweeter from trouble for ever"
2014-08-19 17:18:30	jesusaurus	bajr: well the subject of the phrase is dulcius, which is a comparative
2014-08-19 17:21:44	jesusaurus	i parse it as: "dulcius (ex asperis) (ad nauseum)" which would be "sweeter (out of trouble|tribulations) (continually|for ever)"
2014-08-19 17:21:56	jesusaurus	there's no verb in there
2014-08-19 17:27:45	relsqui	I was actually about to write "lack of verb not that weird" unironically
2014-08-19 17:27:58	relsqui	but, uh, anyway, citing something like "better late than never"
2014-08-19 17:28:02	relsqui	which omits the verb and is clear anyway :)

2014-08-20 08:32:14	tamgc	I guess it depends on the copyright heaviness of GURPS itself...
2014-08-20 08:32:42	tamgc	iirc the reason the generic d20 system exists is because TSR/D&D was pretty open on usage of their stuff
2014-08-20 08:33:09	tamgc	or maybe that was for the various modules that were written for it?
2014-08-20 08:33:51	@bajr	yeah, i think SJ Games is pretty strict about copyright, but perhaps not militantly so like some
2014-08-20 08:36:52	tamgc	(actually, I think it was the modules, iirc the 3.5 -> 4E license change had bruhaha on openness of their license and how they were essentially shooting themselves in the foot)

2014-08-25 13:27:57	relsqui	-_- someone in another channel is trying to defend a system whereby no one can ever use a password anyone else has ever used
2014-08-25 13:28:50	nightfly	heh, that's silly
2014-08-25 13:29:02	relsqui	luckily it's at no risk of being implementable because the person is not comprehending the laundry list of problems other people are pointing out
2014-08-25 13:29:39	nightfly	like that there would have to be a list in plain text of all the previously used (and currently used) passwords
2014-08-25 13:30:08	relsqui	it doesn't have to be plaintext, it can be hashed
2014-08-25 13:30:12	relsqui	but then you can never change the hash :P
2014-08-25 13:32:31	relsqui	also you have a constantly-increasing list of shit to store, etc. etc.
2014-08-25 13:33:05	relsqui	never mind the *political* problems (who keeps the list)
2014-08-25 13:33:48	mancat	and that it makes it possible to phish for passwords without actually needing the hashes
2014-08-25 13:34:02	relsqui	yep
2014-08-25 13:42:48	nibalizer	ya you can hash
2014-08-25 13:42:53	nibalizer	but you have to salt the same 
2014-08-25 13:43:12	nibalizer	so the correct way to salt is usually <secretsalt> + username
2014-08-25 13:43:18	nibalizer	and you could only secretsalt
2014-08-25 13:43:57	relsqui	yeah, that one came up too
2014-08-25 15:37:30	nebrith	amazon has great customer service.
2014-08-25 15:37:54	nebrith	I busted the port on my first gen kindle fire and I'm like "Well before I pony up the 70 measley bucks to replace it, let me check"
2014-08-25 15:38:14	nebrith	Vayne is like "Oh I'll make an exception, it's a port, unless there's pressure damage to the rest, it might be a bad solder job"
2014-08-25 15:38:18	nebrith	"Cool!"
2014-08-25 15:38:44	nebrith	Now it's like OK I don't have the original box, the serial number, it won't turn on so I can't check in its settings, the account I once ordered it with is since closed, and I've had it at least two years.
2014-08-25 15:38:49	nebrith	Poor Vayne. Still trying. Goodness.
2014-08-25 15:41:21	nebrith	<3 What a champ. Yay Amazon. I wish I could just chat with my customers. People yelling sucks.
2014-08-25 16:37:37	zigdon	relsqui: my server window is now labeled 'cat' (since that's the selected server) and I keep thinking I left a command running in there.

2014-08-25 17:01:46	Epitrope	relsqui: was trolling one of the objections raised against the password list?
2014-08-25 17:02:05	relsqui	haha, no, but it should've been

2014-08-25 17:02:17	Epitrope	"oops, sorry, no more passwords left"
2014-08-25 17:02:32	relsqui	presumably the response to that would be constraints on when you can change your password, which ....
2014-08-25 17:02:46	relsqui	yeah.

2014-08-25 17:27:15	nibalizer	wait for an expiry period
2014-08-25 17:27:18	nibalizer	to grab up passwords
2014-08-25 17:27:21	nibalizer	like how freenode expires nicks
2014-08-25 17:27:22	nibalizer	lulz
2014-08-25 17:28:26	@bajr	i wonder if google expires unused accounts >.>
2014-08-25 17:33:20	relsqui	I doubt it. you *can* tell it what you want it to do if you don't use it for a while, though

2014-08-25 21:29:15	tamgc	nebrith: huh amazon++

2014-08-26 12:49:58	Golem	I have never done such a thing
2014-08-26 12:50:07	Golem	Hence I would probably be terrible at it

2014-08-26 13:00:43	Golem	THEN THE STATEMENT STANDS.  TALLY HO, DIRTY JOKES!
2014-08-26 13:01:57	Golem	completely unrelated, I want to play a pathfinder druid again ;_;
2014-08-26 13:02:04	Golem	So many cool ideas
2014-08-26 13:03:24	 *	tamgc played an earthbender-esque druid once...was fun...almost died to the a giant air elemental though -.-
2014-08-26 13:04:34	tamgc	(dwarven druid...used druid powers to 'dig'...and explosions...killed the air elemental with a necklace of fireball trap at least...)
2014-08-26 13:05:14	Golem	Yeah, im thinking back to the days when some of my really good friends from ashland and medford got together for a high level game
2014-08-26 13:05:28	Golem	all built 18th level charecters, and I played a lava druid ^_^
2014-08-26 13:05:32	Golem	good times
2014-08-26 13:05:40	tamgc	heh nice
2014-08-26 13:05:46	Golem	dwarf as well
2014-08-26 13:06:09	Golem	And let me tell you, when you have a witch and a druid and time to work, a lot of those long cast time spells get really nasty
2014-08-26 13:07:06	tamgc	heh sounds like a fun combination
2014-08-26 13:07:22	Golem	Also earth elemental form + bag of holding + stone fortress = bypass ALL the traps
2014-08-26 13:08:22	Golem	Just put your party in the bag, put the bag inside yourself, and let them come up for air once in a while
2014-08-26 13:08:25	tamgc	what's stone fortress do?
2014-08-26 13:08:35	Golem	no no, as in your opponent has a fortress
2014-08-26 13:08:36	Golem	made of stone
2014-08-26 13:08:42	tamgc	ahh
2014-08-26 13:08:49	tamgc	thought it was some spell >.>
2014-08-26 13:08:56	Golem	Could very well be >.<
2014-08-26 13:09:40	Golem	Druid is probaly my favorite pathfinder class. They are just so good at swinging the odds in your favor given a bit of time and planning. 
2014-08-26 13:10:31	tamgc	although like most spellcasters it could swing in a different direction depending on circumstances pretty easily
2014-08-26 13:10:46	tamgc	(and how well prepped you are)
2014-08-26 13:10:59	Golem	yup
2014-08-26 13:11:37	tamgc	anyhoo fuuud
2014-08-26 13:12:00	Golem	Go forth and consume!
2014-08-26 13:13:00	 *	relsqui should that soon
2014-08-26 13:40:49	Takua	Pathfinder
2014-08-26 13:40:51	Takua	So so very good
2014-08-26 13:41:43	 *	Takua would really like to play a Mythic campaign one of these days
2014-08-26 13:42:34	askore	Takua: would you like to.... DM it? :3
2014-08-26 13:43:30	 *	askore thinks what we have here is a critical lack of DMs
2014-08-26 13:43:41	relsqui	here and everywhere
2014-08-26 13:43:49	Golem	I dont want to DM :( I am already a forever DM 
2014-08-26 13:44:02	 *	relsqui would DM, but doesn't really know any of these systems particularly
2014-08-26 13:44:18	tamgc	there's a pretty high DM:Player ratio here, just they're DM'ing elsewhere
2014-08-26 13:44:25	relsqui	also that
2014-08-26 13:45:04	tamgc	relsqui: generally if you have a system, players can adapt to it easier than DM adapting to a system =)
2014-08-26 13:45:18	relsqui	I don't really
2014-08-26 13:45:19	relsqui	heh
2014-08-26 13:45:25	relsqui	I could make one up! that's been known to happen
2014-08-26 13:45:34	relsqui	but learning one might be a better idea
2014-08-26 13:45:46	relsqui	I could pull a bajr and just not tell people the system
2014-08-26 13:46:29	tamgc	yep
2014-08-26 13:46:40	tamgc	Dungeon World is probably kind of more your style
2014-08-26 13:46:50	relsqui	hmm?
2014-08-26 13:48:01	tamgc	it's sort of a story-teller oriented, minimal dice rolling system
2014-08-26 13:49:48	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-26 13:49:54	relsqui	I'm not actually against dicerolling XD
2014-08-26 13:49:58	relsqui	I like a good dungeon crawl as much as anyone :)
2014-08-26 13:50:29	tamgc	yar...just have you as story-oriented-preferred in my head...could be wrong =)
2014-08-26 13:55:55	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-26 13:56:01	relsqui	more about that but afk :)
2014-08-26 13:57:07	Takua	askore: I think that I could DM it, but I am notorious for not putting enough effort into it
2014-08-26 14:03:20	Takua	That said, I do enjoy DMing.  I'm just bad about spending time beforehand preparing.  Which, you know, critical part to DMing
2014-08-26 14:05:58	askore	hehe
2014-08-26 14:06:38	 *	askore considers attempting to DM, but does not know any systems well enough to do so
2014-08-26 14:07:25	tamgc	general rule that I usually go by is the rules are a guide, DM decides
2014-08-26 14:07:37	tamgc	which would bypass most of the familiarity issues heh
2014-08-26 14:13:14	relsqui	haha, yes
2014-08-26 14:13:16	relsqui	important rules
2014-08-26 14:13:39	relsqui	tamgc: I think it's more that I don't like the story falling to the wayside of the metagame (optimizing stats and forgetting about what they mean)
2014-08-26 14:14:39	tamgc	makes sense
2014-08-26 14:19:36	relsqui	spending a day working on the mac is reassuring
2014-08-26 14:19:48	relsqui	I can, actually, still learn a new system if I'm not under pressure and get to just play with it
2014-08-26 14:19:52	relsqui	and have goals
2014-08-26 14:21:29	tamgc	goals++
2014-08-26 14:23:25	relsqui	play++
2014-08-26 14:36:48	Takua	Learning a system is fun for me.  Actually creating the world to interact with characters is harder, simply because my ability to focus on something like that is complete and total shit.  Creating fun plot?  Easier.  Details?  I usually just...wing it.
2014-08-26 14:38:44	relsqui	oh man we should team up, I have the opposite problem
2014-08-26 14:39:11	 *	bajr has takua's problem
2014-08-26 14:39:41	relsqui	bajr: same answer
2014-08-26 14:40:04	relsqui	the limiting factor for me is more time :)

2014-08-26 14:43:54	tamgc	(knew it was in the same nebulous definition, but it's literally slang for nerd...)
2014-08-26 14:58:23	Takua	Teaming up could be fun!
2014-08-26 14:58:45	@bajr	dual-GMs!
2014-08-26 14:59:15	Takua	I've...uh, had a plot going in my head for a long while now regarding something that could easily turn Mythic.  Or else I could just use the Wrath of the Righteous path if nobody has problems with Paths...and feel like kicking demon ass.
2014-08-26 14:59:59	askore	kicking demon asssss
2014-08-26 15:08:18	 *	tamgc calls demon PETA
2014-08-26 15:26:26	Takua	lol
2014-08-26 15:26:42	Takua	Sorry, they can't come to the phone right now, they've all been slain by RIGHTEOUS FURY!

2014-08-26 22:05:51	tamgc	but that would req testing

The bed, false.  Only the food processor will be real, and even that will be a bland paste chemically treated to have the flavor of what you desire.  
2014-08-27 14:38:03	Golem	And people will eat that .sit up
2014-08-27 14:38:26	Golem	until the inevitable pushback and the return to "organic" furnishings at least ^_^

2014-08-27 15:16:26	tamgc	well, I was assuming everyone got rid of theirs for holodeck versions
2014-08-27 15:22:09	Fetter	when it comes to human bones of your enemies, there is nothing like the real thing

2014-08-27 16:35:26	tamgc	depends on how complex you want it?
2014-08-27 16:35:39	tamgc	wearing no, doing things effectively while in armor, yes?
2014-08-27 16:36:52	@bajr	hmm, i feel like encumbrance is bad enough, since there's no way around that.

2014-08-27 22:21:10	sabreman	bajr++
2014-08-27 22:21:16	relsqui	bajr++ :) I'm glad your game is going well
2014-08-27 22:21:26	sabreman	but i definatly need to work on my roleplaying skills (especialy during combat)
2014-08-27 22:21:33	askore	omnomnom
2014-08-27 22:21:53	relsqui	yeah, it's easy to forget it then especially
2014-08-27 22:21:56	relsqui	because you're kinda in tactics mode
2014-08-27 22:22:05	askore	sabreman: have you done much rp'ing before? like on message boards on such, not just rpg's
2014-08-27 22:23:50	 *	askore tries a chia drink, ponders...... this is weird.
2014-08-27 22:25:06	askore	I like that bajr handles all the combat mechanics, because I tend to not mind any of that and go "dammit I just missed twice with my hammer... I kick it! >:("
2014-08-27 22:26:05	relsqui	haha yes
2014-08-27 22:26:17	relsqui	I had that last D&D session except I got to fail my own rolls v_v
2014-08-27 22:26:21	askore	lol
2014-08-27 22:26:23	relsqui	I did ... very little in that fight
2014-08-27 22:26:27	relsqui	oh actually it was a couple sessions ago
2014-08-27 22:26:32	relsqui	last week we were failing different rolls
2014-08-27 22:26:43	askore	hehehe
2014-08-27 22:27:37	relsqui	ugh that went badly
2014-08-27 22:27:40	relsqui	-_-
2014-08-27 22:27:56	relsqui	I'm having sort of a weird problem for an adventurer which is being broke
2014-08-27 22:28:05	relsqui	because we don't, like, dungeon crawl XD
2014-08-27 22:28:06	askore	orly
2014-08-27 22:28:07	relsqui	maybe we should
2014-08-27 22:28:08	askore	lol
2014-08-27 22:28:16	askore	yeah sounds like you need more phat lootz
2014-08-27 22:28:18	relsqui	yes
2014-08-27 22:28:26	relsqui	well, like, there was some thieving
2014-08-27 22:28:29	relsqui	and then there was some honest labor
2014-08-27 22:28:38	relsqui	and then there was busking which involved some of both
2014-08-27 22:28:46	relsqui	but then there was some traveling.
2014-08-27 22:28:58	askore	heh
2014-08-27 22:29:21	askore	nomnom, chia drink and edamame pretty good snack
2014-08-27 22:29:35	relsqui	what be chia drink?
2014-08-27 22:30:17	askore	it's got chia seeds in it, kinda thick and bumpy?
2014-08-27 22:30:24	askore	blackberry flavored
2014-08-27 22:30:24	relsqui	huh okay
2014-08-27 22:31:07	askore	basically I wish it had a lot stronger/more sour flavor
2014-08-27 22:59:34	 *	relsqui looks at to-do list, @_@s
2014-08-27 23:11:47	@bajr	askore: i'm working on a Combat notes page for the players. covers all the important things you might want to do at any given time and the approximate effect they'll have, minimal number crunching
2014-08-27 23:12:05	relsqui	nice
2014-08-27 23:12:11	relsqui	... you realize what you're doing?
2014-08-27 23:12:13	relsqui	you're being a video game.
2014-08-27 23:12:18	@bajr	yep
2014-08-27 23:12:22	@bajr	people love vidya games :)
2014-08-27 23:12:23	relsqui	you are the computer, you crunch all the numbers and just describe stuff
2014-08-27 23:12:24	relsqui	haha
2014-08-27 23:12:49	@bajr	that's actually what I hope to do eventually. make a gurps engine
2014-08-27 23:13:58	@bajr	rumor has it that Fallout started out that way
2014-08-27 23:14:36	relsqui	huh.
2014-08-27 23:15:05	@bajr	relsqui: I am also slowly giving the players more dice roles so that there's a physical action associated with what their game actions
2014-08-27 23:16:11	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-27 23:19:26	drbop	bajr++ Golem++ Pash++ sabreman++
2014-08-27 23:22:09	drbop	My character intentionally had himself locked in a jail cell most of the battle as I was putting rp'ing above combat.
2014-08-27 23:23:07	relsqui	haha, yeah
2014-08-27 23:23:21	@bajr	drbop: i was starting to worry, because the kobolds would have definitely noticed that pash escaped that cell *somehow* and like killed you for being an accomplice
2014-08-27 23:23:35	@bajr	*likely
2014-08-27 23:23:36	relsqui	I've definitely spent combat turns standing around being shocked because that was more RP-accurate than something more tactically advantageous >_>
2014-08-27 23:26:18	drbop	bajr: If that occurred, I was planning on trying to fast-talk the kobolds into believing he was in the cell adjacent to me.
2014-08-27 23:27:45	 *	relsqui puts to-do lists away
2014-08-27 23:27:49	relsqui	so help me I'm not doing any more work tonight
2014-08-27 23:27:53	relsqui	not counting coding. because coding is fun. >_>
2014-08-27 23:29:34	drbop	Yeah, one day recently I was sick.  So instead of doing coding at work, I did coding at home.
2014-08-27 23:29:38	relsqui	lol
2014-08-27 23:29:45	relsqui	right, exactly, you got it
2014-08-27 23:30:13	relsqui	the other stuff I have to do is mostly *for* fun stuff
2014-08-27 23:30:17	relsqui	like the magic club
2014-08-27 23:30:21	relsqui	but the actual things I'm doing are boring (sending emails)
2014-08-27 23:31:30	relsqui	and also paying bills and dealing with health insurance stuff x_x
2014-08-27 23:31:35	relsqui	but it's that many fewer things I have to deal with tomorrow :)

2014-08-28 11:40:11	relsqui	oh man you guys
2014-08-28 11:40:13	relsqui	I slept so long
2014-08-28 11:40:24	relsqui	I needed tht really badly
2014-08-28 11:40:48	tamgc	\o/ sleep++
2014-08-28 11:40:53	tamgc	hibernation++
2014-08-28 11:40:55	relsqui	sleep++++++
2014-08-28 11:41:10	relsqui	I slept from 12-8, and then closed my eyes again and kinda dozed for a while and then it was 11:30
2014-08-28 12:51:29	 *	bajr did that too >.>
2014-08-28 12:53:52	relsqui	that++
2014-08-28 14:03:42	relsqui	I don't know how I only just realized that the CAT is basically a nerdy frat
2014-08-28 14:03:48	relsqui	except no house
2014-08-28 14:03:50	relsqui	we should have a house
2014-08-28 14:05:24	tamgc	we use FAB
2014-08-28 14:05:59	relsqui	yeah but we're not supposed to sleep here
2014-08-28 14:06:04	relsqui	:P
2014-08-28 14:06:17	tamgc	there's rules against that now? o.O
2014-08-28 14:06:38	tamgc	create an under-tile city
2014-08-28 14:06:48	relsqui	we've been told not to? on account of it's a workplace. like, I don't think they care if students do, but cats/staff aren't supposed to
2014-08-28 14:08:28	relsqui	yess I'm for it
2014-08-28 14:08:44	tamgc	ah fair enough
2014-08-28 14:08:48	@bajr	we also have several cat houses: blkperl's house, my place, i'm sure there are others
2014-08-28 14:09:21	relsqui	eh, not all of us are on "randomly showing up at your home" terms with either of you :P
2014-08-28 14:09:25	 *	relsqui has never been to your house
2014-08-28 14:09:28	relsqui	also, not on campus :)
2014-08-28 14:10:27	@bajr	true
2014-08-28 14:10:55	tamgc	relsqui: just get into party crasher mindset like I do, and show up anyways >.>
2014-08-28 14:11:43	relsqui	that works for parties but not for sleeping :P
2014-08-28 14:11:46	relsqui	and I like sleeping more than parties
2014-08-28 14:11:47	relsqui	(most parties)
2014-08-28 14:15:09	jesusaurus	sounds like the solution is sleepover - best of both worlds

2014-08-28 14:46:16	askore	it seems to me the randomly showing up would be easier if there was more space 
2014-08-28 14:46:20	askore	at blkperl house
2014-08-28 14:46:30	askore	two people show up and suddenly there's no more nap room
2014-08-28 14:47:19	tamgc	just do the ol' cuddle pile, plenty of room then
2014-08-28 14:48:27	askore	yeah, but contingent on being comfortable with cuddles
2014-08-28 14:49:19	@bajr	lol, that's totally a knife
2014-08-28 14:50:36	tamgc	yep (on both counts)
2014-08-28 14:53:24	relsqui	man I miss having a group of humans I was that comfy with
2014-08-28 14:53:28	relsqui	that hasn't really been a thing since, like
2014-08-28 14:53:29	relsqui	high school
2014-08-28 14:53:39	relsqui	and, you know, even then mitigated by crippling self-doubt
2014-08-28 14:53:47	 *	bajr nods.
2014-08-28 14:54:14	@bajr	i think the cat has been the first groups of humans i have been comfortable being around (generally) since I was in high school theater
2014-08-28 14:54:52	relsqui	bajr: <3
2014-08-28 15:02:23	askore	:D
2014-08-28 15:02:25	askore	yes
2014-08-28 15:02:42	askore	but my willingness to cat-pile on the couch depends on more than who is on the couch
2014-08-28 15:03:10	tamgc	also yep
2014-08-28 15:03:26	tamgc	rumor has it blkperl is a shitty cuddler >.>
2014-08-28 15:03:31	askore	lol
2014-08-28 15:04:04	 *	bajr can attest to this
2014-08-28 15:04:37	 *	tamgc has no idea how one fails at cuddling...but then again is unrated =P
2014-08-28 15:05:15	relsqui	I can imagine that
2014-08-28 15:05:17	@bajr	karmabot: tamgc is This Cuddler Is Not Yet Rated
2014-08-28 15:05:17	karmabot	Done, bajr.
2014-08-28 15:05:25	relsqui	hahahaha
2014-08-28 15:05:27	askore	I don't think it's objectionable, just not optimal, and bajr has high cuddling standards
2014-08-28 15:05:44	tamgc	-.- bajr++
2014-08-28 15:06:01	@bajr	i... do have high cuddling standards >.>
2014-08-28 15:06:20	tamgc	but...what are you rating them on?
2014-08-28 15:08:04	 *	tamgc also curious as to what's bajr rating would be...is it a high standard because you provide high standard...or just expect it...=P
2014-08-28 15:09:19	askore	mmmmm tea
2014-08-28 15:09:25	@bajr	it's something of a 3-point rating system: Stiffness/Squishiness, Contact Area, and Heat Index.
2014-08-28 15:09:57	@bajr	tamgc: I hope the former, the latter is probably true
2014-08-28 15:10:50	jesusaurus	dont forget about curlability/liquid-factor, thats also important
2014-08-28 15:11:05	jesusaurus	cats are great at cuddling because they are liquids
2014-08-28 15:11:23	@bajr	that would be included somewhat in their squishability, yes?
2014-08-28 15:11:26	relsqui	bajr: this is making me want to cuddle on you
2014-08-28 15:11:42	jesusaurus	i think its separate
2014-08-28 15:11:55	jesusaurus	its more maleability than squishyness
2014-08-28 15:11:57	relsqui	hmm. separate, but correlates strongly to squishiness and contact area
2014-08-28 15:12:07	@bajr	true
2014-08-28 15:12:22	@bajr	so more of a 4-point system then
2014-08-28 15:12:35	relsqui	"being a cat who's interested in cuddling" is a major advantage anyway
2014-08-28 15:13:21	 *	bajr attempts to rate himself...
2014-08-28 15:15:33	jesusaurus	oh another factor related to squishiness but not to stiffness: the elbow factor
2014-08-28 15:15:37	relsqui	haha, yeah
2014-08-28 15:15:50	askore	lol
2014-08-28 15:15:52	jesusaurus	ive got some pretty sharp shoulders
2014-08-28 15:15:54	relsqui	on a related note I would like to put in a good word for dating people trained in massage
2014-08-28 15:16:21	jesusaurus	yes. massage++
2014-08-28 15:16:22	relsqui	I have had a makeout/cuddling session that also involved, like, shoulder/arm/wherever he could reach massage
2014-08-28 15:16:25	tamgc	jesusaurus: but...you probably don't dig them into people?
2014-08-28 15:16:26	relsqui	simultaneously
2014-08-28 15:16:31	relsqui	and it was p. much the best thing
2014-08-28 15:16:40	jesusaurus	tamgc: not on purpose
2014-08-28 15:17:18	relsqui	yeah, that's still a thing though, I've been on the other end of it
2014-08-28 15:17:31	relsqui	leaning on shoulders can also be part of cuddling
2014-08-28 15:17:40	@bajr	Stiffness: 6, Contact Area: 8-9, Heat Index: 9, Liquid factor: 4, Form Factor: Big Spoon / Squid
2014-08-28 15:17:46	relsqui	XD squid
2014-08-28 15:18:07	relsqui	do you have, like
2014-08-28 15:18:09	relsqui	extra arms I don't know about
2014-08-28 15:18:16	@bajr	that sounds dirty
2014-08-28 15:18:18	jesusaurus	does a high heat index mean you radiate a lot of heat, or thats its an ideal amount?
2014-08-28 15:18:19	 *	relsqui snrk
2014-08-28 15:18:26	@bajr	jesusaurus: I am a human furnace
2014-08-28 15:18:32	relsqui	oh you're one of those
2014-08-28 15:18:34	@bajr	yep
2014-08-28 15:18:47	tamgc	jesusaurus: he's saying "I'm hot"
2014-08-28 15:18:51	 *	relsqui can big spoon or little spoon, but middle spoon is best spoon
2014-08-28 15:18:57	relsqui	tamgc: like we didn't all know that already
2014-08-28 15:19:34	jesusaurus	middle spoon is best spoon
2014-08-28 15:19:35	@bajr	so by Squid I mean i have a tendency to wrap myself around people somewhat constrictingly
2014-08-28 15:19:54	 *	bajr is best as one of the outer spoons, due to high heat index
2014-08-28 15:20:07	tamgc	I guess if you're pointy enough, your form factor would be a spork
2014-08-28 15:20:10	relsqui	bajr: hee
2014-08-28 15:20:11	relsqui	that sounds great
2014-08-28 15:20:20	relsqui	also you sound a lot like my friend shrdlu :)
2014-08-28 15:20:27	relsqui	who I forget if you met while he was here, but you've seen in otherirc
2014-08-28 15:21:14	@bajr	i did not meet shrdlu :<
2014-08-28 15:21:24	relsqui	you'll have more chances! he misses pdx and will be back :)
2014-08-28 15:21:40	relsqui	...
2014-08-28 15:21:48	relsqui	I'm trying to figure out what I should be doing right now
2014-08-28 15:21:59	@bajr	i had a hard time rating my personal stiffness. I just know that my legs are particularly... muscle-y
2014-08-28 15:22:00	relsqui	I have nix projects, but I'm here as hiss right now and am not sure I actually have any hiss things to do

2014-08-28 15:22:58	relsqui	yeah that's probably what it'll be
2014-08-28 15:23:05	@bajr	hmm, been a while since I showed up to the cat in my skin-tight biking gear >.>
2014-08-28 15:23:09	relsqui	although it's just programming, so I'm not really learning anything about our systems in particular *g*
2014-08-28 15:23:13	@bajr	people complained last time I did it
2014-08-28 15:23:29	relsqui	bajr: oh man, when I used to be at zigdon's all the time, he was bike commuting in spandex
2014-08-28 15:23:34	relsqui	and he would get home and I would be like <_< UNF hi

2014-08-28 15:27:36	Takua	I am a fan
2014-08-28 15:27:42	 *	bajr is communing with others to standardize the cuddle-rating system
2014-08-28 15:27:46	tamgc	ooh ooh...what's Takua rating?
2014-08-28 15:27:47	 *	relsqui cuddles takua

2014-08-28 15:29:12	zigdon	we totally could.
2014-08-28 15:29:18	 *	tamgc kind of wants an official bajr cuddle rating system now...that can then be distilled to a single number...
2014-08-28 15:29:24	zigdon	I still want to start watching it from the begining, but that's unrelated
2014-08-28 15:29:48	relsqui	tamgc: bajr cuddle index?
2014-08-28 15:29:49	tamgc	"you're rated 7.6 bajrs"
2014-08-28 15:29:53	@bajr	tamgc: i'm not sure it's possible to distill to a single number, too many variables
2014-08-28 15:29:59	tamgc	relsqui: yes. BCI
2014-08-28 15:30:38	relsqui	mancat, zigdon: wait, apparently aliaras is going to be in CA next weekend also -_-
2014-08-28 15:32:58	zigdon	relsqui: yeah, but I hear she ain't going to make it out of the south bay
2014-08-28 15:33:11	relsqui	zigdon: we'll make it *into* it though
2014-08-28 15:33:24	tamgc	bajr: doesn't have to be perfect
2014-08-28 15:33:38	zigdon	*you* will.
2014-08-28 15:33:54	relsqui	:P look, I'm just saying
2014-08-28 15:33:59	relsqui	I'm not actually trying to make a plan for all of us
2014-08-28 15:34:02	zigdon	(not saying I won't, just that I don't know that I will)
2014-08-28 15:34:07	relsqui	that said

2014-08-28 15:34:14	relsqui	^_^
2014-08-28 15:34:15	relsqui	yes.
2014-08-28 15:34:19	relsqui	that should completely be a thing
2014-08-28 15:34:22	mancat	mongo++
2014-08-28 15:34:26	relsqui	:D
2014-08-28 15:34:32	@bajr	mongo like candy!
2014-08-28 15:34:38	relsqui	zigdon: also, zomg fakir's is that weekend
2014-08-28 15:34:50	relsqui	I might have to get, like

2014-08-28 15:34:53	relsqui	>_>
2014-08-28 15:36:44	relsqui	zigdon: btw, it sounds like we're expecting to get in on thursday. can I be at your place that night?

2014-08-28 15:39:42	relsqui	<_<
2014-08-28 15:39:46	relsqui	I don't believe you.
2014-08-28 15:40:17	relsqui	anyway, plan is roughly to be with you for a few days and violet for a few days, maybe minus some days spent not in berkeley, tbd
2014-08-28 15:40:30	relsqui	will know more after doing some planning this weekend
2014-08-28 15:40:37	 *	Takua honestly saw "Be with you for a few days and violent for a few days"
2014-08-28 15:41:07	relsqui	probably not :)
2014-08-28 15:41:41	zigdon	relsqui: nod - btw, just you, or posse too?
2014-08-28 15:55:00	relsqui	good question. only *needs* to be me but it might be useful if it were possible for it to be some portion of posse also
2014-08-28 15:55:24	relsqui	I'll know more about that this weekend, we're meeting up to figure out some logistics
2014-08-28 16:19:20	 *	relsqui has finally given up on bouncy ball chair
2014-08-28 16:19:28	relsqui	exacerbating lower back pain, Ithink
2014-08-28 16:19:37	relsqui	switching back and forth is probably nice, that and regular chair promote different habits
2014-08-28 16:20:28	askore	awww uhura looks so comfy
2014-08-28 16:20:35	relsqui	kitty <3
2014-08-28 16:20:45	askore	she's all curled up in a little ball on the couch
2014-08-28 16:22:03	zigdon	knowing it's a cat seems important
2014-08-28 16:22:25	askore	yup
2014-08-28 16:23:51	 *	askore is debating between delivery pizza or actually cooking something for dinner
2014-08-28 16:26:07	@bajr	askore: cooking
2014-08-28 16:26:21	@bajr	cheaper and more delicious
2014-08-28 16:26:26	@bajr	generally
2014-08-28 16:26:50	askore	mmmm
2014-08-28 16:26:52	askore	yah

2014-08-28 16:31:04	askore	that's pretty cool, though.
2014-08-28 16:31:11	relsqui	eh?
2014-08-28 16:31:18	@bajr	also about the time when we realized that UAVs could do something other than be toys. I could totally see these things delivering emergency supplies (maybe not packages in the near future).
2014-08-28 16:31:52	@bajr	I can't wait for the FAA to actually start plans to make sensible regulation of drone usage
2014-08-28 16:50:22	askore	when in doubt, toss a hoodie over the cat
2014-08-28 16:50:30	askore	she's peeking out at me, sooo cute

2014-08-28 19:25:57	tamgc	bajr: oh card access may be a bit wonky in the near future btw, they're working out a new process...apparently after Dan left, stacy potter sort of took over but was kind of winging it, so some people knew to do things while others didn't...not sure how much it effects CATaccess though

2014-08-28 21:12:32	relsqui	hahaha yessss
2014-08-28 21:34:30	askore	uhura is attempting parkour....
2014-08-28 21:35:33	tamgc	uhura++
2014-08-28 21:35:56	drbop	uhura++
2014-08-28 21:36:40	tamgc	keyword: attempting
2014-08-28 21:36:50	tamgc	is she trying to get somewhere? o.O
2014-08-28 21:38:10	askore	probably not? there's a lot of bouncing off the bed and running up and down the hall
2014-08-28 21:38:15	askore	normal cat-crazies
2014-08-28 21:55:51	askore	ouch! ok the parkour can stop now... i dont need claws on the back of my legs... :/
2014-08-28 21:56:02	relsqui	uhura disagrees, I take it
2014-08-28 21:56:21	askore	much bouncing
2014-08-28 21:58:31	tamgc	would you prefer claws in other parts of the leg?
2014-08-28 22:01:38	askore	there are less sensitive parts
2014-08-28 22:02:00	askore	i would prefer she returned to the sleeping posture she's spent all day in...
2014-08-28 22:02:46	tamgc	so you prefer clawing of less sensitive parts...hmm...*overpsychoanalyzes* =P
2014-08-28 22:03:02	tamgc	sleep++
2014-08-28 22:04:00	tamgc	(she's probably running around because she spent all day sleeping -.-)
2014-08-28 22:04:07	tamgc	you need laser pointers
2014-08-28 22:04:22	relsqui	I gotta bring a sweatshirt back to leave here
2014-08-28 22:04:28	relsqui	I don't want in when I'm outside, home, or in transit
2014-08-28 22:04:31	relsqui	just frickin' fab :P
2014-08-28 22:04:41	tamgc	lulz
2014-08-28 22:05:04	tamgc	alternative solution, bring takua or bajr, use their body heat index
2014-08-28 22:05:22	tamgc	although bajr has not rated takua body heat index, so not sure how effective that would be >.>
2014-08-28 22:05:44	relsqui	iirc he's pretty warm. I dunno about bajr levels of radiation though
2014-08-28 22:05:50	relsqui	need to hug both of them more for further data samplign
2014-08-28 22:06:39	 *	tamgc needs certified indexing of said data
2014-08-28 22:08:09	relsqui	I wonder how to measure that
2014-08-28 22:08:13	jesusaurus	would should start a table for collecting these data
2014-08-28 22:08:19	relsqui	I mean, you can measure temperature, obviously
2014-08-28 22:08:37	relsqui	but poking someone with a thermometer to measure cuddliness just feels wrong
2014-08-28 22:08:47	tamgc	yeah, you'll need random samplings
2014-08-28 22:08:51	relsqui	maybe put the thermometer between two people ^_^
2014-08-28 22:09:00	relsqui	"hold this here for 5m and then see what it reads"
2014-08-28 22:09:01	tamgc	best when they least expect it, don't want to get bias from the subjects
2014-08-28 22:09:18	jesusaurus	haha, bias
2014-08-28 22:09:26	tamgc	sshhh
2014-08-28 22:09:34	jesusaurus	"im going to be hot this time..."
2014-08-28 22:09:36	tamgc	oh tackle hugs may be required
2014-08-28 22:09:44	tamgc	just to make sure they don't move too much
2014-08-28 22:09:51	tamgc	and mess up the readings
2014-08-28 22:09:57	jesusaurus	glomp factor is separate from cuddle factor
2014-08-28 22:10:14	tamgc	jesusaurus: nah, more "oh crap, about to get bear hugged again"
2014-08-28 22:10:21	tamgc	and physiological responses to that
2014-08-28 22:10:38	tamgc	jesusaurus++ hmm true
2014-08-28 22:10:43	tamgc	both will need to be tested
2014-08-28 22:11:36	relsqui	takua's here, I could probably randomly go hug him
2014-08-28 22:11:46	relsqui	there are people he wouldn't do that too but I'm pretty sure he'd be okay with it
2014-08-28 22:11:50	relsqui	er, people I wouldn't do that to*
2014-08-28 22:12:35	relsqui	haha, nik just came by the cs lounge and asked me when bar camp is
2014-08-28 22:12:39	tamgc	(Disclaimer: not actually sure where takua's physical boundaries are -.-)
2014-08-28 22:13:00	 *	tamgc no idea who nik is or why they're there at 10PM
2014-08-28 22:13:10	relsqui	"I saw it in passing but missed the date, and I thought you might be here"
2014-08-28 22:13:10	relsqui	lol
2014-08-28 22:13:16	relsqui	he's a cs student, I know him from tutoring
2014-08-28 22:13:50	tamgc	ahh
2014-08-28 22:15:41	relsqui	also, yes, wouldn't be joking about sneaking up and glomping someone whose boundaries I wasn't at least somewhat familiar with :)
2014-08-28 22:16:20	 *	tamgc would >.> <.<
2014-08-28 22:16:29	tamgc	but doesn't mean I'd actually do it
2014-08-28 22:16:42	relsqui	hehe
2014-08-28 22:16:48	relsqui	which is the important part
2014-08-28 22:23:49	askore	cant decide if sleep or read more....

2014-08-29 14:12:22	relsqui	argh, I did something stupid
2014-08-29 14:12:28	askore	?
2014-08-29 14:12:35	relsqui	wanted to test out new-to-me shoes to see if they're comfy/fit right for every day wear
2014-08-29 14:12:39	relsqui	so I wore them!
2014-08-29 14:12:45	relsqui	and did not bring any backup in case the answer is "no" :P
2014-08-29 14:12:48	askore	ooooooo
2014-08-29 14:12:55	tamgc	d'oh
2014-08-29 14:12:55	relsqui	the answer is so far no, although I have some hope that they can be padded to be usable
2014-08-29 14:12:55	Pash	that is unfortunate
2014-08-29 14:13:06	 *	askore thinks there is a first aid kit around which has band aids, if that is required
2014-08-29 14:13:07	relsqui	luckily I have also now done most of the walking I need to do today
2014-08-29 14:13:17	Pash	maybe they'll break in?
2014-08-29 14:13:17	relsqui	askore: I think I'm okay, I just need to stay off them
2014-08-29 14:13:20	askore	okie
2014-08-29 14:13:23	relsqui	Pash: they're not new and stiff
2014-08-29 14:13:28	askore	I've decided to just wear flip flops forever
2014-08-29 14:13:31	relsqui	haha

2014-08-29 14:13:54	relsqui	hehehe
2014-08-29 14:14:00	askore	and it's much more comfortable
2014-08-29 14:14:01	Pash	I'm probably gonna wear my current shoes until they literally fall apart >.>
2014-08-29 14:14:06	askore	haha
2014-08-29 14:14:18	relsqui	that is what I always do
2014-08-29 14:14:21	askore	well that's part of why I'm not wearing my usual slip-ons
2014-08-29 14:14:24	askore	they're falling apart
2014-08-29 14:14:31	relsqui	because I can't afford to not do that
2014-08-29 14:14:38	relsqui	I have these because they were on the curb and they looked like they fit
2014-08-29 14:14:50	relsqui	and they mostly do, they just have this cavernous heel which gives my feet a lot of vertical travel
2014-08-29 14:15:02	relsqui	which is the actual problem.
2014-08-29 14:15:05	askore	oooo
2014-08-29 14:15:19	relsqui	this is why I think padding might help

2014-08-29 16:09:28	@bajr	Fox: you never talk when I'm on >:(
2014-08-29 16:09:30	Fox	It's my preferred system amongst the ones I've tried.
2014-08-29 16:09:35	relsqui	also it's slightly unnerving to type in here and see Pash's terminal move
2014-08-29 16:09:36	tamgc	pfd20srd.com (iirc)
2014-08-29 16:09:42	@bajr	at least 50% of my discussion in here is totally tabletop
2014-08-29 16:09:42	Pash	hehehe
2014-08-29 16:09:58	Fox	tamgc, go here
2014-08-29 16:10:00	Fox	http://paizo.com/prd/
2014-08-29 16:10:01	link-bot	Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Reference Document (http://goo.gl/R4nxXH)
2014-08-29 16:10:31	tamgc	ah nm, thinking http://www.d20pfsrd.com/
2014-08-29 16:10:33	link-bot	Pathfinder_OGC (http://goo.gl/mxns)
2014-08-29 16:10:35	Fox	It's easy to sort out what books you're actually referencing this way. The d20pfsrd has lots of third party stuff mixed in. :)
2014-08-29 16:10:45	Fox	If you have a group that doesn't care, then it's ok
2014-08-29 16:10:45	 *	jesusaurus bookmarks
2014-08-29 16:10:50	Fox	but otherwise it can be confounding
2014-08-29 16:10:53	tamgc	official one used to be behind the unofficial one iirc
2014-08-29 16:11:22	tamgc	the 3rd party stuff is generally marked -.-
2014-08-29 16:11:22	Fox	the prd came first, and then the pfsrd came and opened up a shop, so they're separate now
2014-08-29 16:11:37	Fox	Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't.
2014-08-29 16:11:40	tamgc	well yeah, prd is the official one
2014-08-29 16:11:52	Fox	I've had players get confused over it, so I direct them to the PRD if they don't have the actual books.
2014-08-29 16:11:56	tamgc	(paizo's the publishers for PF)
2014-08-29 16:12:05	Fox	yea
2014-08-29 16:14:06	 *	bajr bows his head in defeat and realizes he's not actually going to get work done today
2014-08-29 16:14:29	relsqui	lol
2014-08-29 16:14:31	 *	bajr brings out the gurps books
2014-08-29 16:14:34	Fox	>_>;
2014-08-29 16:14:50	Fox	bajr: This is why I keep my Pathfinder books out of the HISS cube :)
2014-08-29 16:14:54	@bajr	hehe
2014-08-29 16:14:57	Fox	They're at home. On my bookshelf.
2014-08-29 16:14:58	Fox	;)
2014-08-29 16:15:35	Fox	tamgc: I don't mean to come off gruffly. My impression is that a bunch of people were being introduced to the game suddenly.
2014-08-29 16:15:54	@bajr	i would, but I have a very hard time concentrating at home
2014-08-29 16:16:00	Fox	3rd-party things are typically marked; I can only name a few sections where it's not.
2014-08-29 16:16:15	tamgc	McGruff fox =P
2014-08-29 16:16:27	tamgc	(nah not gruff at all)
2014-08-29 16:16:30	Fox	Mythic Feats and Environmental Rules are 2 of these places, and my friend Eric started reading things off to me that I never heard about. P:
2014-08-29 16:16:52	tamgc	eh, it's up to the GM to define what's usable anyways
2014-08-29 16:17:00	Fox	Yeah
2014-08-29 16:17:11	tamgc	and it has enough info to get people started on basic mechanics
2014-08-29 16:17:21	Fox	I use anything Paizo publishes with very few exceptions
2014-08-29 16:17:37	Fox	This player was confused and thought everything on that website is "anything Paizo publishes" :P
2014-08-29 16:17:47	tamgc	been a long time since I've looked at PRD, so maybe it's improved, but the d20pfsrd was a lot more usable than the PRD back in the day
2014-08-29 16:17:59	Fox	They updated it ~5 days ago
2014-08-29 16:18:12	Fox	it includes everything up to Bestiary 4 and the Technology Guide now, iirc
2014-08-29 16:18:22	Fox	It doesn't have the Advanced Class Guide yet, but...
2014-08-29 16:18:29	Fox	that book has a lot of things that need errata anyway.
2014-08-29 16:18:42	Fox	:P
2014-08-29 16:18:49	Fox	Or more, clarification
2014-08-29 16:19:16	@bajr	Fox: what is paizo, for the uneducated bajr?
2014-08-29 16:19:37	Pash	Paizo is a gaming company that publishes Pathfinder
2014-08-29 16:19:39	Fox	Paizo Publishing is the company that makes the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.
2014-08-29 16:19:41	Fox	^
2014-08-29 16:19:42	Pash	ninja'd
2014-08-29 16:19:44	Fox	Ya
2014-08-29 16:20:01	Fox	They wrote some stuff for 3.5e and then became their own company when their content got popular.
2014-08-29 16:20:22	 *	bajr nods.
2014-08-29 16:20:31	@bajr	and WotC allowed this?
2014-08-29 16:20:46	Pash	more detailed: they used to write Dragon magazine back in 3.5, had a falling out with wizards when 4e came out, and then made their own game instead
2014-08-29 16:20:53	Fox	^
2014-08-29 16:21:04	Pash	WotC had/has no choice, the OGL permits it and cannot be changed.
2014-08-29 16:21:16	Fox	They also wrote a few 3.5e adventures outside of Dragon
2014-08-29 16:21:29	tamgc	TSR/d20 system was a lot more open in the 3.5 era
2014-08-29 16:21:29	Fox	but were best known for Age of Worms and Rise of the Runelords at the time
2014-08-29 16:22:09	Fox	I have all the dragon mags with Age of Worms... :)
2014-08-29 16:22:11	tamgc	basically the d20 system itself is pretty open
2014-08-29 16:22:13	Fox	I want to run that one someday
2014-08-29 16:22:35	Pash	I have pdfs of all of Dragon, up through about a year ago
2014-08-29 16:22:57	 *	bajr discovers that gurps is not an ogl system
2014-08-29 16:23:00	@bajr	sadness
2014-08-29 16:23:07	Fox	Is not indeed
2014-08-29 16:23:17	Pash	the OGL is rather unique, I'm pretty sure
2014-08-29 16:23:45	@bajr	i'm sure my modifications to gurps won't be a problem so long as I don't widely distribute and/or make money off it
2014-08-29 16:24:02	@bajr	until such a point as it is sufficiently distanced from gurps
2014-08-29 16:25:03	Pash	so long as you aren't making money or reprinting big sections of the original, widespread distribution shouldn't get you in trouble at all
2014-08-29 16:25:22	Pash	spread them houserules, this is what internet is for
2014-08-29 16:25:33	@bajr	true
2014-08-29 16:25:59	Fox	My "houserules" are mostly guidelines
2014-08-29 16:26:15	Fox	I tend to let anything slide, as long as the players recognize the repercussions :p
2014-08-29 16:26:27	 *	bajr is pleased that he is maintaining organization while he essentially structures and writes his homebrew.
2014-08-29 16:26:44	Fox	evil PCs, min-maxing, etc.
2014-08-29 16:26:52	Fox	I'm glad for you bajr
2014-08-29 16:26:55	Fox	Keep it up P:
2014-08-29 16:29:46	@bajr	:P
2014-08-29 16:30:31	Pash	no, keep it down, bajr.  Gotta roll low
2014-08-29 16:30:51	Fox	bajr doesn't strike me as the kind of guy with many ranks in Stealth...
2014-08-29 16:31:15	Pash	that just means he's stealthy about his stealth
2014-08-29 16:32:26	@bajr	what i lack in stealth i make up for with my ability to give no fucks
2014-08-29 16:32:32	askore	\o/
2014-08-29 16:32:41	 *	askore considers gathering some people and playing tiny-d&d
2014-08-29 16:32:44	Fox	I make up for my lack of stealth with a high Fortitude save and lots of CON.
2014-08-29 16:32:56	@bajr	fox is a tank
2014-08-29 16:33:08	Fox	I'm pretty sure my 1st-level feat was Toughness.
2014-08-29 16:33:26	@bajr	karmabot: Fox is the party tank
2014-08-29 16:33:26	karmabot	K, bajr.
2014-08-29 16:33:26	Pash	tiny D&D? like, we'd play fairies?
2014-08-29 16:33:36	@bajr	Pash: gnomes
2014-08-29 16:33:40	askore	Pash: that is an option
2014-08-29 16:33:40	Fox	As long as there's no gno-
2014-08-29 16:33:41	Fox	BAJR
2014-08-29 16:33:42	Fox	NO
2014-08-29 16:33:42	askore	yes
2014-08-29 16:33:44	@bajr	Pash: maybe even brownies
2014-08-29 16:33:44	askore	lol
2014-08-29 16:33:45	Pash	that's just small-D&D
2014-08-29 16:33:52	@bajr	I would totally play in a party of brownies
2014-08-29 16:34:00	askore	no tiny-d&d is a little quarter-page character sheet with rules written on the back
2014-08-29 16:34:05	askore	designed for very short sessions
2014-08-29 16:34:07	askore	like, a lunch break
2014-08-29 16:34:14	 *	Fox likes to pretend to have a seething hatred of gnomes.
2014-08-29 16:34:23	@bajr	Fox: "pretend"
2014-08-29 16:34:27	Pash	I like my version better
2014-08-29 16:34:28	 *	Fox has players who actually have this hatred.
2014-08-29 16:34:33	@bajr	we all know it's just jealousy
2014-08-29 16:34:38	Fox	Some of them have unhealthy hatred of gnomes...
2014-08-29 16:34:47	Fox	They met a gnomish drug dealer...
2014-08-29 16:34:53	Fox	Now apparently all gnomes are drug dealers...
2014-08-29 16:34:58	Fox	And all drug dealers are gnomes..
2014-08-29 16:35:09	askore	heheh
2014-08-29 16:35:10	@bajr	they robbed you of your ability to be short
2014-08-29 16:35:20	@bajr	>.>
2014-08-29 16:35:21	@bajr	<.<
2014-08-29 16:35:40	Fox	As for tiny D&D?
2014-08-29 16:35:43	Fox	That could be fun.
2014-08-29 16:35:45	askore	yup
2014-08-29 16:35:49	 *	bajr agrees
2014-08-29 16:35:50	Fox	I'd just run We Be Goblins! :P
2014-08-29 16:35:52	askore	lol
2014-08-29 16:36:08	askore	bajr: wanna print out some character sheets? :3
2014-08-29 16:36:14	Fox	Premise: You are a group of goblins. One of the goblins has been caught writing and reading.
2014-08-29 16:36:25	@bajr	oh god now i have to find them >.>
2014-08-29 16:36:27	askore	lol
2014-08-29 16:36:36	Fox	Purpose: You are to set off to get your souls back from the goblin that wrote down your names.
2014-08-29 16:36:44	Fox	You are armed with fireworks and barbed wire.
2014-08-29 16:36:48	askore	hahaha
2014-08-29 16:36:50	askore	cute
2014-08-29 16:36:52	Pash	Fox: I suggest cutting
2014-08-29 16:37:00	Fox	P:
2014-08-29 16:38:31	relsqui	Fox: this sounds awesome
2014-08-29 16:40:11	Fox	I've run this with 3 new groups of players
2014-08-29 16:40:16	Fox	One took about 13 minutes
2014-08-29 16:40:22	Fox	Another took ~2 hours
2014-08-29 16:40:26	Fox	And one took 14 hours
2014-08-29 16:40:30	askore	haha
2014-08-29 16:40:32	Fox	Mileage varies greatly.
2014-08-29 16:40:58	@bajr	askore: I suspect I somehow deleted the character sheets
2014-08-29 16:41:08	askore	bajr: >:(

2014-08-29 16:42:17	@bajr	askore: I could probably try to draft up some new ones
2014-08-29 16:42:21	 *	askore decrees: this tiny-d&d campaign has a height limit, all PC's must be less than six inches tall
2014-08-29 16:44:32	relsqui	now I kinda wanna run something with tiny characters but set in, like, fab
2014-08-29 16:44:33	relsqui	at normal scale
2014-08-29 16:44:38	askore	ooooo
2014-08-29 16:44:46	Fox	Everyone plays kittens with class levels...
2014-08-29 16:44:51	relsqui	so you're dealing with a bizarre perspective on a place you already know :)
2014-08-29 16:45:16	Pash	hm, kittens would make fantastic battle mounts for fairies
2014-08-29 16:45:41	Fox	My kitten wizard shall serve as the glorious steed for my pixie cavalier?
2014-08-29 16:46:31	Fox	Lead the charge, Sir Sparklefingers IV!
2014-08-29 16:46:47	Pash	http://geekologie.com/2014/01/09/cat-battle-armor-1.jpg
2014-08-29 16:48:35	tamgc	hmm are smurfs 6" tall?
2014-08-29 16:48:52	Fox	We're going to need a lot of natural 20s to open doors...
2014-08-29 16:49:15	Fox	And that's if a 20 succeeds.
2014-08-29 16:49:35	tamgc	(this tiny D&D sounds a bit like http://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/mice-and-mystics )

2014-08-29 16:49:42	Pash	we just need a sorcerer with Open/Close
2014-08-29 16:50:02	@bajr	Fox: don't need to role 20s, just need some really awesome climbing stats
2014-08-29 16:50:03	tamgc	or magic hand
2014-08-29 16:50:49	Fox	Time for that Young cat wizard/cleric/mystic theurge...
2014-08-29 16:50:55	Fox	We're going to need all the cantrips.
2014-08-29 16:53:21	Fox	Also, that Mice and Mystics thing looks adorable.
2014-08-29 16:54:24	tamgc	yeah, haven't played it yet, but makes me think of Redwall
2014-08-29 16:55:50	 *	tamgc actually has it somewhere...just never got around to cracking it open/reading the rules -.-
2014-08-29 16:56:17	Fox	Sounds like half the contents of peoples' Steam libraries. :)
2014-08-29 16:56:40	tamgc	half sounds generous heh
2014-08-29 16:56:51	tamgc	also board games tend to be a different than steam =P
2014-08-29 16:56:57	Fox	Yisssss
2014-08-29 16:57:24	Fox	Taking people who mostly play video games into tabletops is weird...
2014-08-29 16:57:51	Fox	In my experience, at least.
2014-08-29 16:58:08	Pash	really?  I haven't had too much trouble with it
2014-08-29 16:58:57	Fox	Most of my players who came from mostly playing games became min-maxers and didn't enjoy the RP aspect :p 
2014-08-29 16:59:01	Fox	Got better over time, though.
2014-08-29 16:59:17	Fox	~s/playing games/playing video games/
2014-08-29 16:59:26	Pash	ah, I haven't really had that experience
2014-08-29 17:00:28	tamgc	eh, I don't think that's a video vs board game situation
2014-08-29 17:00:39	tamgc	it's just different people have different mentalities towards games
2014-08-29 17:00:52	Fox	My sample size is small
2014-08-29 17:01:05	Fox	6-8 people
2014-08-29 17:01:07	Fox	So probably
2014-08-29 17:01:21	tamgc	yeah...that's not the best sample heh
2014-08-29 17:01:38	 *	tamgc hung out at gamestores almost daily for a couple of years >.>
2014-08-29 17:02:14	Fox	I've watched people play D&D Next at Guardian Games a few times, but that's the extent of it for me :p 
2014-08-29 17:02:27	tamgc	and organzied some meetups... <plug>portlandgamers.org</plug> =P
2014-08-29 17:02:49	tamgc	but it's been a while, time and all that
2014-08-29 17:03:00	Fox	What systems have you played, and which was your favourite, tamgc?
2014-08-29 17:03:26	tamgc	people game for different reasons, and [insert psychoanalysis of gamers here]
2014-08-29 17:03:51	Fox	I like to pretend to be in someone else's shoes. So that's my reason, there. :)
2014-08-29 17:03:58	tamgc	PF, savage worlds, gurps, traveller, warhammer, warmachine, D&D 2nd/3.5/4th...
2014-08-29 17:04:26	tamgc	uh...never played WoD in PnP form, but liked the video games/system from that
2014-08-29 17:05:11	tamgc	ORE, Dungeon World, uh...a lot of random ones
2014-08-29 17:05:28	tamgc	savage worlds is sort of my mental fallback these days, although I've played PF the most
2014-08-29 17:06:11	tamgc	haven't played any fudge dice system ones, but that seems interesting...
2014-08-29 17:06:51	tamgc	terror thirteen was a really well made horror one that I don't think got much traction
2014-08-29 17:07:16	tamgc	like the mechanics of itself essentially makes the games play out like a horror movie
2014-08-29 17:07:37	Fox	I've played 3.5e, 4e, and PF, so my experiences aren't as varied
2014-08-29 17:08:02	tamgc	not a bad thing...there comes a point where you start mixing rulesets... -.-
2014-08-29 17:08:43	Fox	Hehe
2014-08-29 17:08:55	Pash	I think exploring rulesets has more good than bad in it.  You have a lot to keep straight, but you get a better feel for what's out there and what you want from a ruleset
2014-08-29 17:09:14	Fox	I've been playing/running PF games every week for 3 years, and I have no real complaints with it
2014-08-29 17:09:54	tamgc	Pash: yeah, until you go back to a game that uses basic rules...then it becomes a "Wait...ok so that guy's prone...so does he get bonuses to defense?  Cover...is that +2 or +4?" etc
2014-08-29 17:10:07	tamgc	and you end up having to look up rules a lot more -.-
2014-08-29 17:10:11	Pash	like I said, stuff to keep straight
2014-08-29 17:10:38	Fox	Cover is +4 in PF and people who are prone get -4 AC vs. melee attacks and +4 vs. ranged ;p
2014-08-29 17:10:52	tamgc	at that point, the 'what you want from a ruleset' benefit is kind of meh =P
2014-08-29 17:10:56	Fox	:P
2014-08-29 17:11:09	tamgc	Fox: and what if the attack is above the prone person? =)
2014-08-29 17:11:11	@bajr	this is why I'm of a mind that the GM should be the only rules interpreter >.>
2014-08-29 17:11:29	@bajr	and just wing it where he doesn't remember some random number
2014-08-29 17:11:44	tamgc	bajr: yeah, I tend to be fine with that
2014-08-29 17:11:44	relsqui	I think it's important that the gm be the final one, but not necessarily the only one :)
2014-08-29 17:11:53	Pash	tam: depends on how good you are at remembering rules
2014-08-29 17:11:54	tamgc	some players require a mental framework to work with things though
2014-08-29 17:12:13	tamgc	also depends on how the players/gm interact...and how 'punishing' certain things are
2014-08-29 17:12:22	Fox	In my games, if someone has a rules question and can't find the answer in 2 minutes, I make something up :)
2014-08-29 17:12:37	relsqui	I've definitely just straight-up contradicted something in a one-shot adventure I was running for some people
2014-08-29 17:12:44	relsqui	because it was clearly bullshit
2014-08-29 17:12:51	Pash	bajr: I don't like the approach, because I am generally of the opinion that the less hats the DM must wear at any given time, the better
2014-08-29 17:12:58	relsqui	"give them this huge penalty based on how long they did x, without giving them any indication that would happen when they chose to do x"
2014-08-29 17:13:17	tamgc	wizard tries something physical and fails...not knowing the ruleset, that may seem silly...if they're overly punished for the failure for something they have no idea on...that drives players away
2014-08-29 17:13:45	Fox	i.e.
2014-08-29 17:14:06	Fox	"I try to jump over the pit."
2014-08-29 17:14:09	Fox	>Player tries
2014-08-29 17:14:12	Fox	>Player rolls 19
2014-08-29 17:14:17	Fox	"What do you mean that fails?"
2014-08-29 17:14:20	Fox	>engage frustration
2014-08-29 17:14:23	@bajr	Pash: I think it's a matter of convenience, largely. It's useful to have knowledgable players, and often more fun for everyone, but it's hard to have that expectation
2014-08-29 17:14:24	Fox	Avoid that kind of thing.
2014-08-29 17:14:31	tamgc	Pash: yeah, I tend to have a more referential memory, so I tend to group ideas of similar things together...which means things get blurred at some point once you get to 5+ systems (not including random board game rules)
2014-08-29 17:14:39	relsqui	Fox: at that point actually I feel like it's the DM's job to have said "okay, but it's going to be really really hard, this is very unlikely to work"
2014-08-29 17:14:43	relsqui	or, better
2014-08-29 17:14:51	relsqui	"it's super far and you don't think you can make it, but it's your only chance, do you want to try anyway?"
2014-08-29 17:14:53	@bajr	I need to get a watch or timer...
2014-08-29 17:15:14	Fox	relsqui: Yes.
2014-08-29 17:15:14	tamgc	overall, it just all depends on the group, and what people are looking for
2014-08-29 17:15:17	Fox	That's what I'm getting at.
2014-08-29 17:15:20	Pash	tam: I compartmentalize rulesets pretty well, so it's mostly a non-cost for me to try a bunch of things
2014-08-29 17:15:20	relsqui	yes :)
2014-08-29 17:15:29	Fox	I have a group that WILL try something that only succeeds with a natural 20.
2014-08-29 17:15:31	tamgc	Pash: tab complete isn't that hard -.-
2014-08-29 17:15:40	Fox	... it's a lot of fun, frankly. :)
2014-08-29 17:15:46	relsqui	hee
2014-08-29 17:15:48	Pash	it's super hard
2014-08-29 17:15:51	tamgc	Pash: also fair enough heh
2014-08-29 17:15:54	Pash	I try not to put things on my tab
2014-08-29 17:16:06	 *	tamgc sneaks items onto Pash's tab
2014-08-29 17:16:07	relsqui	that's what it's for
2014-08-29 17:16:48	tamgc	I've also played with things where natural 20 isn't automatic success...because somethings, no matter what, just shouldn't be possible -.-
2014-08-29 17:17:05	Fox	In Pathfinder, nat. 20s only auto-succeed on attack rolls and saving throws
2014-08-29 17:17:10	tamgc	yeah
2014-08-29 17:17:22	Pash	bajr: It is more convenient to have knowledgeable players, but laying the gm as the only rules interpreter rather inhibits it
2014-08-29 17:17:26	tamgc	then there are systems with exploding dice...which I actually like better than autos
2014-08-29 17:17:41	Fox	I have no opinion on exploding dice vs. 20.
2014-08-29 17:17:44	Pash	(exploding dice)++
2014-08-29 17:17:45	Fox	p:
2014-08-29 17:17:52	relsqui	Pash: what if players have additional knowledge but they let the dm ask?
2014-08-29 17:17:58	relsqui	like "hey someone remind me what the bonus is for this"
2014-08-29 17:18:02	tamgc	it's basically when you roll the max of a dice, you get to re-roll and add that...ad infinitum
2014-08-29 17:18:04	relsqui	but not "no, dm, you did that wrong, it should've been x"
2014-08-29 17:18:14	Pash	relsqui:  that works if the DM actually asks.
2014-08-29 17:18:20	relsqui	why?
2014-08-29 17:18:25	relsqui	if the dm doesn't, and things just proceed, that's okay
2014-08-29 17:18:49	Pash	that can be okay, but it's not that thing happening then
2014-08-29 17:18:54	Fox	I find it amusing that this conversation gets no input from me, when I've been GMing for 2 and a half years
2014-08-29 17:19:07	relsqui	Fox: how does it get no opinion from you? I was talking from you a minute ago :P
2014-08-29 17:19:34	Fox	Because you were responding to me giving an example for tamgc :o
2014-08-29 17:19:41	relsqui	fair
2014-08-29 17:19:55	relsqui	anyway I'm not actually reading everything in this channel >_>
2014-08-29 17:20:07	 *	relsqui is playing a game and butting in on piratez and ryan's meeting
2014-08-29 17:20:15	Fox	I know a lot of the rules, but not all of them.
2014-08-29 17:20:16	tamgc	yeah, I tend to not read what that relsqui person says anyways >.>
2014-08-29 17:20:37	Fox	For example, I trust my players when they use mounted combat, because I don't know it well myself.
2014-08-29 17:20:40	Fox	p:
2014-08-29 17:20:46	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-29 17:21:03	Fox	But I know most of the spells and what actions all the class abilities are and how they interact
2014-08-29 17:21:12	Fox	Since I've used most of them against my PCs by now :)
2014-08-29 17:21:16	relsqui	hehehe
2014-08-29 17:21:30	Pash	ouch
2014-08-29 17:21:42	Pash	some of the PF spells are just brutal, too
2014-08-29 17:22:03	Fox	Some of them are. Good examples...
2014-08-29 17:22:11	Fox	Magic Jar, Baleful Polymorph, Dominate <x>.
2014-08-29 17:22:29	Fox	Then there's less insidious things, like Create Pit and Obscuring Mist.
2014-08-29 17:22:35	Pash	Web is an old favorite
2014-08-29 17:23:10	Fox	My PCs tend to be really lucky on saving throws
2014-08-29 17:23:17	Fox	So good on them :)
2014-08-29 17:23:55	Fox	If I know they have an ability that helps them on an important save, such as rolling twice and taking the better result, or the ability to add +4 or something
2014-08-29 17:24:06	Fox	I give them hints so that they use these abilities when it matters. p:
2014-08-29 17:24:43	Fox	"You feel something reaching into your brain; your wrist clicks, and you feel yourself start to move like a puppet."
2014-08-29 17:24:44	relsqui	I have gotten in the habit of rolling diligently for my daily wild magic resistance even though it has literally never mattered
2014-08-29 17:24:56	relsqui	just on principle
2014-08-29 17:24:57	relsqui	^_^
2014-08-29 17:24:59	Fox	> "I'M ROLLING TWICE."
2014-08-29 17:25:21	relsqui	haha
2014-08-29 17:25:23	relsqui	what was the cue there?
2014-08-29 17:25:44	tamgc	that they're about to be controlled...pretty big one heh
2014-08-29 17:25:48	Fox	When you describe puppeteering or robotic movement in Pathfinder, it typically signals mind control.
2014-08-29 17:26:01	Fox	Which... sucks.
2014-08-29 17:26:04	Fox	Needless to say.
2014-08-29 17:26:14	tamgc	of course, if the player is new...they might not realize that
2014-08-29 17:26:31	tamgc	(and/or forget about their abilities -.-)
2014-08-29 17:26:33	Fox	If they are, the other players start yelling and make the message known :)
2014-08-29 17:26:41	Pash	in my experience, the chorus of "oooohhhhhh fuck" from the rest of the table generally clues them in
2014-08-29 17:26:48	Fox	^
2014-08-29 17:27:10	Fox	The game I'm currently running is Mythic, which means that players have a mechanic called Surge.
2014-08-29 17:27:18	relsqui	well, yeah, I saw what was *happening* :P I just don't know what kind of ability they might have had
2014-08-29 17:27:21	relsqui	I know literally nothing about pf
2014-08-29 17:27:23	Fox	Basically, after you see the results of the d20 roll, you can add 1d6 to try to change it.
2014-08-29 17:27:39	tamgc	heh, there are some very clueless players that get one-track-minded about things sometimes
2014-08-29 17:27:47	Fox	Indeed are
2014-08-29 17:27:58	Fox	I know my gunslinger/cleric's spells and domain powers better than he does ;)
2014-08-29 17:28:28	tamgc	and also, depending on the DM/group it could be encouraged for players to make their own decisions instead of playing by commitee
2014-08-29 17:29:16	Fox	Yes indeed, it can
2014-08-29 17:30:04	Pash	yeah, but reminding someone of what they can do when it's useful is generally not the same as playing by committee
2014-08-29 17:30:13	Fox	^
2014-08-29 17:30:56	tamgc	then there are some meta-factors too...like time...if each player takes 1 minute for their turn, for a 6 member party, it could be 5 mins/action...which could get boring for players
2014-08-29 17:31:23	Fox	"This troll's presence is overpowering. You may want to use Bless, since that helps you stomach your fear." etc.
2014-08-29 17:31:24	tamgc	Pash: yep, but many players like to discuss why they should do X
2014-08-29 17:32:03	Fox	Yeah, time is a big factor in combat. People can get bored waiting for turns and stop paying attention when fighting is amiss.
2014-08-29 17:32:17	tamgc	(and then some that gets pissed if a player doesn't min-max their gameplay...)
2014-08-29 17:32:34	Fox	Luckily, I only have one person who does that
2014-08-29 17:32:43	Fox	And he's learned to keep quiet on it
2014-08-29 17:33:16	tamgc	yeah, a lot of variance, some people are able to correct their behaviour to conform to the group more than others...some like to try to drag the group with them
2014-08-29 17:33:27	 *	Fox nods
2014-08-29 17:33:49	Pash	gaming etiquette: it matters
2014-08-29 17:34:16	tamgc	I tend to end up being extra cautious when there are new players to boot...because some strong personalities tend to drive them away...
2014-08-29 17:34:26	relsqui	minmaxing is a closer hit on the thing I don't like than numbers/mechanics
2014-08-29 17:34:34	relsqui	I like playign with numbers if they contribute
2014-08-29 17:34:36	tamgc	Pash: general etiquette too heh
2014-08-29 17:34:45	relsqui	but optimizing at the expense of roleplay defeats the point for me
2014-08-29 17:35:00	Fox	I have one player who's a min-maxer, but he recognizes it and is one of the most vocal roleplayers
2014-08-29 17:35:04	Fox	so I don't mind
2014-08-29 17:35:13	tamgc	relsqui: yar, problem is numbers/mechanics and minmaxing tends to go hand in hand
2014-08-29 17:35:46	Pash	Fox:  I am basically that guy
2014-08-29 17:35:49	tamgc	and then there are some instances/systems where you kind of have to minmax in order to 'keep up'
2014-08-29 17:36:01	Fox	Some people say Pathfinder is like that
2014-08-29 17:36:05	Fox	I disagree, myself
2014-08-29 17:36:11	Fox	As do my players
2014-08-29 17:36:20	Fox	But we play very liberally and do crazy things :)
2014-08-29 17:36:28	Pash	Pathfinder can be like that.  It depends on your group
2014-08-29 17:36:30	tamgc	depends how 'by the book' you are heh
2014-08-29 17:37:07	tamgc	(like if you're designing encounters with the default CR ratings...that likely won't fly, since that's designed with the idea that the players will be at certain levels with certain gear...)
2014-08-29 17:37:25	tamgc	and even then, the CR ratings might be off...
2014-08-29 17:37:32	Fox	Some are.
2014-08-29 17:37:45	tamgc	depends on how the party plays too sometimes...
2014-08-29 17:37:56	relsqui	tamgc: I don't think they have to go hand and hand. minmaxing is a player choice
2014-08-29 17:38:00	relsqui	you don't have to use the numbers that way
2014-08-29 17:38:03	tamgc	spellcasters tend to be the highest variable in those cases
2014-08-29 17:38:09	Fox	Shadow Demon is listed as CR 7, is closer to CR 11. Wight is CR 3, which is in the realm of possibility for a 1st-level party, but instantly kills them to resurrection/true resurrection territory if they're hit once.
2014-08-29 17:38:35	Fox	And then there's things like the Ogre, which is CR 3 but a 2nd-level party could topple easily.
2014-08-29 17:38:38	Fox	It varies.
2014-08-29 17:38:42	tamgc	relsqui: you don't, but when you don't causes a severe penalties on what you can do, it could be painful for the player and party
2014-08-29 17:38:54	relsqui	yeah, true
2014-08-29 17:39:03	relsqui	Fox: where does CR come from?
2014-08-29 17:39:11	Fox	CR = Challenge Rating
2014-08-29 17:39:18	relsqui	I gathered that, but where does it *come* from :)
2014-08-29 17:39:22	relsqui	what makes something a CR x
2014-08-29 17:39:26	Fox	There's guidelines based on the stats and abilities of a creature to determine how tough it is.
2014-08-29 17:39:28	tamgc	just published with the monsters
2014-08-29 17:39:33	Fox	Armor Class, Hit Points, Spell-like Abilities, modes of movement
2014-08-29 17:39:34	Fox	etc.
2014-08-29 17:39:39	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-29 17:39:52	Pash	relsqui:  hueristics
2014-08-29 17:40:01	Fox	Something with a CR equal to the party's level, in theory, is a "modest challenge".
2014-08-29 17:40:08	Fox	Someone will get injured or dropped unconscious.
2014-08-29 17:40:12	 *	relsqui nods
2014-08-29 17:40:24	Fox	Whereas CR +4... the party is suspected to have a 5% chance of survival.
2014-08-29 17:40:28	Fox	Not success. Survival.
2014-08-29 17:40:31	relsqui	lol
2014-08-29 17:40:54	Fox	How well CR works depends on who's playing and whether or not they try to break the system.
2014-08-29 17:41:13	relsqui	haha
2014-08-29 17:41:14	Fox	I have a party of characters who all rolled 15-18 across the board in every ability score... so I can throw CR +5 at them and they're ok.
2014-08-29 17:41:19	Fox	Heh. :)
2014-08-29 17:41:21	tamgc	abilities/synergy of abilities...environment...creativity...
2014-08-29 17:41:25	Pash	^ including the DM
2014-08-29 17:41:30	tamgc	yep
2014-08-29 17:41:47	relsqui	...
2014-08-29 17:41:48	relsqui	now I wanna game
2014-08-29 17:41:49	relsqui	dammit, guys.
2014-08-29 17:42:02	tamgc	took down a dragon once that we were supposed to run from with the help of a net and a pig...
2014-08-29 17:42:07	Fox	I'll see if I can find time to start another game in Fall term ;p
2014-08-29 17:42:09	Pash	I blame you, Andy and Ted for leaving town
2014-08-29 17:42:34	relsqui	yeah v_v
2014-08-29 17:42:36	relsqui	tamgc: hahaha awesome
2014-08-29 17:42:58	Fox	I took down a dragon that was sieging a city by shooting a goblin at it from a catapult.
2014-08-29 17:43:11	tamgc	haha nice
2014-08-29 17:43:13	relsqui	fox casts fling
2014-08-29 17:43:14	Fox	It took damage and failed the Fly check to keep its stability while flying...
2014-08-29 17:43:14	relsqui	it's super effective
2014-08-29 17:43:23	Fox	So it crashed into the city wall
2014-08-29 17:43:37	Fox	That was a good day. :)
2014-08-29 17:43:41	Pash	I took down a wyvern once with a sword.  While I was riding it.  In the air.
2014-08-29 17:43:41	relsqui	that sounds awesome
2014-08-29 17:43:51	Pash	I didn't plan that out very well.
2014-08-29 17:43:57	Fox	Here, Pash.
2014-08-29 17:44:00	Fox	Have 10d6 falling damage.
2014-08-29 17:44:02	Fox	;)
2014-08-29 17:44:27	tamgc	our situation, we netted the dragon and brought it to the ground...with the help of the pigs strength -.-...surprisingly easy to kill it once it wasn't able to fly around
2014-08-29 17:44:51	Fox	I played a bard/barbarian and we encountered a tyrannosaurus...
2014-08-29 17:44:57	relsqui	Fox: can we go back to the part where flinging the goblin resulting in destruction or at least dissuasion of the dragon
2014-08-29 17:45:03	relsqui	I missed that part
2014-08-29 17:45:43	Fox	The goblin was a goblin barbarian 6 by the name of Stumpbiter who managed to cling to his back and jab him with a spear a few times.
2014-08-29 17:46:07	Fox	He did enough damage to make the dragon lose its stability and they both went hurtling down into the wall.
2014-08-29 17:46:16	relsqui	oh, got it
2014-08-29 17:46:31	Fox	Neither survived, but Stumpbiter was immortalized in a chalk drawing on the wall.
2014-08-29 17:46:34	Fox	A true goblin legend. ;)
2014-08-29 17:46:41	relsqui	hahaha <3
2014-08-29 17:46:43	tamgc	heh chalk drawing
2014-08-29 17:46:45	relsqui	thank you, that helps
2014-08-29 17:47:12	Fox	When we encountered that T-Rex, instead of rolling to escape when it bit me
2014-08-29 17:47:24	Fox	I climbed down its throat and stabbed it in the stomach with a dagger until it died.
2014-08-29 17:47:27	Fox	:)

2014-09-01 16:28:31	dom	im just afraid I'd drop it

2014-09-01 16:49:28	askore	yeah, that's valid. And it does still have some unfinished feel
2014-09-01 16:50:25	dom	its got some cool terrain gen though, especially the races' dungeons and settlements

2014-09-02 17:24:26	nebrith	He pushes his back and ass into my head until I notice my head is off the pillow and he's splayed out across the whole damn thing.
2014-09-02 17:24:44	nebrith	If I hug the pillow aggressively and sleep on my belly, he's laying on my ass growling softly and kneading my buttpart.
2014-09-02 17:24:49	nebrith	And I'm like "COME ON"

2014-09-07 18:10:22	askore	those glowing things are used to make a special weapon; I needed one more (out of 20), and suddenly...
2014-09-07 18:14:07	dom	lol
2014-09-07 18:14:40	askore	don't you mean kek
2014-09-07 18:19:46	dom	no
2014-09-07 18:19:49	dom	kek is special
2014-09-07 18:21:55	askore	sure...
2014-09-07 18:26:30	tamgc	heh could you get special weapon again?
2014-09-07 18:27:54	askore	nope
2014-09-07 18:28:05	askore	but if I could I'd definitely have enough lying there for another 
2014-09-07 23:47:15	@bajr	rawr!
2014-09-07 23:47:20	@bajr	latex is weird ._.
2014-09-08 00:19:36	dom	so don't wear it, dummy
2014-09-08 00:22:19	@bajr	but it feels so good....

2014-09-08 07:58:26	tamgc	yeah, you gotta paint it on, wearing it just makes it hard to remove =P
2014-09-08 08:07:24	stormcrow	I wonder how many horrible, horrible emails the LaTeX devs get thanks to the limitations of plaintext...
2014-09-08 08:12:29	 *	tamgc imagines bajr painting his beard with latex and then trying to remove it... >.>
2014-09-08 08:47:23	askore	bleh
2014-09-08 08:47:29	askore	I ran out of chapstick so I bought a new one
2014-09-08 08:47:34	askore	and it tastes bad :/
2014-09-08 10:05:01	Takua	Get to Phoenix, it's 97.  that night, thunderstorm, 3 inches of rain in a few hours, Phoenix gets flooded...and there's an acid leak in the lab above where my conference room is
2014-09-08 10:08:34	stormcrow	Takua: ...is every work trip you take determined to be even more terrible than the last?
2014-09-08 10:10:03	jesusaurus	RIP Takua 
2014-09-08 10:10:20	jesusaurus	though 'acid from above' is a pretty epic way to go
2014-09-08 10:11:39	Takua	jesusaurus: It really is
2014-09-08 10:11:42	Takua	stormcrow: Clearly!
2014-09-08 10:12:08	Takua	So much for having a dry heat though
2014-09-08 10:13:26	jesusaurus	yeah... all that rain is about to become humidity
2014-09-08 10:13:38	Takua	Yeahhh
2014-09-08 10:13:40	 *	jesusaurus looks at the cold overcast skies of seattle
2014-09-08 10:13:53	 *	Takua feels jealous for the cold skies of seattle
2014-09-08 10:14:30	Takua	On a different note, I hate the Phoenix airport.
2014-09-08 10:14:49	Takua	10 minute rides to car rental places are not high on my list of "Preferred airport features"
2014-09-08 10:15:02	jesusaurus	yeah, it sucks
2014-09-08 10:15:34	jesusaurus	also, it doesnt have any benches or chairs anywhere
2014-09-08 10:15:46	 *	jesusaurus had an overnight layover in that airport years ago
2014-09-08 10:16:31	Takua	Ew.
2014-09-08 10:16:33	Takua	I'm sorry
2014-09-08 10:19:13	tamgc	jesusaurus: depends on how fast the 'acid from above' is
2014-09-08 10:19:29	tamgc	if you get Chinese-Water-Tortured with acid...not as epic...
2014-09-08 10:19:40	tamgc	(eh...I guess still epic...but more painful -.-)
2014-09-08 10:20:43	 *	stormcrow is also jealous for the cold, overcast skies of Seattle
2014-09-08 10:21:03	stormcrow	it was 95 this weekend...looks like it'll be the same next weekend
2014-09-08 10:21:54	tamgc	oh hey, so that's why it was so hot...<.<
2014-09-08 10:22:14	Takua	Ugh...come forth the cold skies of fall and winter
2014-09-08 10:22:23	Takua	Come forth and chill us
2014-09-08 10:22:32	stormcrow	not this year, apparently
2014-09-08 10:22:37	tamgc	"Winter is coming." just not nearly fast enough
2014-09-08 10:22:49	stormcrow	I wonder if Rentrak would let me work remotely from Alaska...
2014-09-08 10:23:08	tamgc	if they have a division up there, they'd prob be happy to send you up there
2014-09-08 10:24:56	stormcrow	Sadly, no. For some reason, they tend not to think there's a good reason to have a branch of a company about viewer demographics up in Alaska.
2014-09-08 10:25:11	stormcrow	They do give me an air-conditioned room to work in, though, so there's that.
2014-09-08 10:25:22	stormcrow	(speaking of work, I should go do that now)
2014-09-08 11:00:53	Takua	Oh...also, my personal laptop died.  On the plane.
2014-09-08 11:01:02	Takua	As in, scorched silicone.  On a plane.
2014-09-08 11:01:32	Takua	The flight attendants were super happy when they suddenly smelled that.
2014-09-08 11:01:53	askore	eeeesh
2014-09-08 11:02:23	askore	sounds like you're having a great time Takua :/
2014-09-08 11:05:38	Takua	Great time.
2014-09-08 11:05:57	Takua	T__T I just want cool Portland weather
2014-09-08 11:07:31	stormcrow	I don't know what gods you pissed off, but I'm pretty sure nothing short of human sacrifice will appease them enough to stop screwing with you this much
2014-09-08 11:08:26	Takua	I think the answer is that I pissed them all off
2014-09-08 11:13:30	tamgc	well thar's yer problem
2014-09-08 11:13:41	tamgc	you're supposed to crush them and rule with an ironfist
2014-09-08 12:38:32	dom	phoenix is pretty awful, just as a place in general
2014-09-08 12:38:37	dom	southern arizona is much better imo
2014-09-08 12:40:09	@bajr	i have no love for phoenix
2014-09-08 12:40:13	@bajr	they have no trees
2014-09-08 12:40:46	dom	well, most of the southwest doesn't have a ton of tree
2014-09-08 12:41:06	@bajr	i don't really like most of southwest >.>
2014-09-08 12:41:52	tamgc	but think of all the awesome dirt
2014-09-08 12:42:02	dom	I like the canyons and arroyos
2014-09-08 12:42:07	dom	I think they're cool shit
2014-09-08 12:42:13	dom	but I hate the big cities down there
2014-09-08 12:42:26	Takua	I'm with bajr
2014-09-08 12:42:37	tamgc	the biggest issue with Arizona is...it's Arizona...
2014-09-08 12:43:19	Takua	Arizona seems to be an arid, barren hell whose sole purpose in life is to fill me with pain and suffering
2014-09-08 12:43:50	Takua	(But I need green and water in my life)
2014-09-08 12:44:16	dom	thats because you're in phoenix
2014-09-08 12:44:22	Takua	True
2014-09-08 12:44:47	Takua	Friday cannot come quickly enough
2014-09-08 12:44:50	dom	southern arizona is much greener
2014-09-08 12:45:10	Takua	Ah
2014-09-08 12:46:04	Takua	Friday will come, I will get to the airport at like 1, spent two or three hours at a restaurant inside, and expense it all while I LAUGH AND LAUGH

2014-09-14 16:47:21	relsqui	argh, I need to eat another thing and nothing around here is appealing
2014-09-14 16:47:26	relsqui	this is why I end up downtown all the fucking time
2014-09-14 16:47:44	 *	relsqui isn't home enough to want to keep food here, but there aren't many good places nearby to *get* food
2014-09-14 16:47:48	relsqui	especially on a sunday afternoon

2014-09-14 17:11:07	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-14 17:11:25	relsqui	part of the problem is I'm sick of eating *shitty* food, or else I'd just get something from convenience store :P
2014-09-14 17:11:27	dom	wel, not tons, but I dont care about eating at safeway
2014-09-14 17:11:41	relsqui	have, like, beans, though, so might chili or something
2014-09-14 17:11:49	dom	theres an idea
2014-09-14 17:11:54	relsqui	not what I want but it'll stop me stressing out about not having eaten
2014-09-14 17:12:02	relsqui	^ basically my life every weekend
2014-09-14 17:12:03	relsqui	it's stupid

2014-09-14 17:35:20	@bajr	heh
2014-09-14 17:35:47	@bajr	to be fair, the original work is pretty fast paced
2014-09-14 17:36:11	relsqui	yeah
2014-09-14 17:36:14	relsqui	just not by erock standards :P
2014-09-14 17:39:40	 *	relsqui catches up, enjoys metal safety dance
2014-09-14 17:53:27	tamgc	relsqui: pre-prepped frozen meals to toss in oven/steamer/microwave?
2014-09-14 17:53:54	relsqui	maybe. in my head it's hard to justify the expense, but of course when the alternative is eating out ...
2014-09-14 17:54:12	relsqui	the chili came out okay though. cans work pretty well
2014-09-14 17:54:36	relsqui	I mean, it's not a particularly good *chili* but it's hot food which is edible
2014-09-14 17:54:44	relsqui	having a well-stocked spice cabinet helps
2014-09-14 17:55:06	tamgc	yeah

2014-09-14 23:17:43	relsqui	¯\(°_o)/¯
2014-09-14 23:24:02	tamgc	maybe he's taking a break?
2014-09-14 23:24:22	tamgc	or allowing others to have some alone time
2014-09-14 23:28:15	dom	or he got messily undressed
2014-09-14 23:29:41	tamgc	dom: not as amusing =P

2014-09-16 13:50:45	stormcrow	nebrith: I think putty is available as a stand-alone executable. No need to install, so you could definitely run it on your system. Sounds like it would still be a bad idea, though.
2014-09-16 13:52:35	relsqui	stormcrow: and probably couldn't get netout

2014-09-16 14:38:04	@bajr	all we need are mass-produced high-tensile strength carbon nanotubes and the sufficient infrastructure in space to build them
2014-09-16 14:38:08	relsqui	no big
2014-09-16 14:38:12	@bajr	totally
2014-09-16 14:38:42	@bajr	and then the sufficient computing power and foresight to maneuver the elevator to avoid debris
2014-09-16 14:39:45	Takua	Sadly, I have the feeling that it's the infrastructure necessary to build them that'll be the problem
2014-09-16 14:39:56	@bajr	yeah...
2014-09-16 14:40:06	@bajr	also finding carbon nanotubes strong enough
2014-09-16 14:40:28	Takua	Nah.  There'll be commercial application for those, someone will want to make money off them and invent them
2014-09-16 14:40:53	@bajr	there's tons of useful stuff in space that we could capitalize off of in space
2014-09-16 14:41:17	@bajr	like Helium, Iridium, and other hard-to-find-on-Earth resources
2014-09-16 14:41:33	Takua	Oh absolutely
2014-09-16 14:43:30	@bajr	oh well >.>
2014-09-16 14:52:36	dom	we could make a giant sling
2014-09-16 14:52:43	dom	like how they launch gliders sometimes
2014-09-16 14:52:51	dom	or planes on short air carriers
2014-09-16 14:52:58	dom	and point it straight up
2014-09-16 14:56:15	@bajr	I think that's been proposed, but problems abounded with rate of acceleration and energy
2014-09-16 14:56:56	dom	yar
2014-09-16 14:57:47	dom	also it'd have to be fucking massive to break out of the earth's atmosphere, if its even possible with a sling
2014-09-16 14:57:56	 *	bajr nods
2014-09-16 14:58:28	dom	hmmmmm but nothing stopping us from using it in space
2014-09-16 14:58:36	dom	elasticity still works sans gravity, yeah?
2014-09-16 15:03:09	Takua	Yes...but at that point I'd ask what you're anchoring it to
2014-09-16 15:03:45	jesusaurus	yeah, half the energy would go into sending the sling in the other direction
2014-09-16 15:04:05	jesusaurus	if you could even pull it taught
2014-09-16 15:04:21	jesusaurus	*taut
2014-09-16 15:11:31	Golem	Anchor it to an asteroid ;p
2014-09-16 15:11:49	Golem	throw the ship one direction, and get a free asteroid ^_^
2014-09-16 15:12:28	@bajr	just make sure that both objects go the directions you want them to go >.>
2014-09-16 15:12:34	@bajr	or you're gonna have a bad times

2014-09-16 18:08:44	@bajr	 ^ Neat, simple concept for passphrase generation without a computer
2014-09-16 22:19:39	@bajr	question of the night... Why did repeating crossbow, invented in about 181 AD, never find common use outside of East Asia?
2014-09-16 22:21:39	jesusaurus	i dont think they had much range
2014-09-16 22:22:21	jesusaurus	a longbow could kill you before youre close enough empty your clip
2014-09-16 22:23:58	@bajr	yeah, most sources I find seem to mention it's "weak" for a crossbow, without explaining much else. 
2014-09-16 22:27:00	dom	longbows kind of take the same technological spot as well, without needing more resources
2014-09-16 22:27:52	dom	with a longbow, you can still shoot through chainmail with a strong enough draw (pretty easy to attain) and thats really enough for most of history until gunpowder
2014-09-16 22:27:56	 *	bajr nods.
2014-09-16 22:28:30	dom	crossbows are much easier to learn for a person with no experience over a longbow, but that doesn't matter much until the renaissance because so many people used archery for hunting
2014-09-16 22:28:56	dom	in the renaissance and the age of powerful citystates, a man might grow up without ever touching a bow, and so a crossbow would be a better idea for them
2014-09-16 22:29:00	@bajr	and bows are easier to make
2014-09-16 22:29:04	dom	yep
2014-09-16 22:29:54	dom	and its easier to figure out how to make a longbow from just using a hunting bow rather than a crossbow
2014-09-16 22:30:25	dom	"hunting bows" being classified as anything from 50 lbs draw downwards, longbows as anything over that
2014-09-16 22:31:43	dom	when was plated armor used in china?
2014-09-16 22:32:10	dom	that might have an effect, since thats more prone to deflect an arrow
2014-09-16 22:35:59	dom	im really just spitballin here
2014-09-16 22:37:41	@bajr	I don't think China really ever had the resources for very much plate mail
2014-09-16 22:37:55	@bajr	they generally went for small plates and scales

2014-09-17 06:24:29	Corax	But no, she really isn't that generous. You just deserved it.
2014-09-17 06:34:08	Corax	I think the bigger problem for space elevators is the swaying.
2014-09-17 06:35:33	Corax	You've got gravitational tugs from the sun and moon, and solar winds. And thanks to coriolis effect, the motion of the elevators themselves adds more wobble.
2014-09-17 06:36:28	Corax	Ever seen a car antenna with a not-very-aerodynamic antenna-topper, go flailing madly as the car goes down the highway?
2014-09-17 06:37:12	Corax	Yeah. Like that, except the antenna is miles long, very expensive, and is flailing through a space surprisingly cluttered with space junk and satellites.
2014-09-17 06:38:12	Corax	Not to mention the difficulty that wobble would pose for entering intended orbits & trajectories correctly.

2014-09-17 13:14:12	dom	why would anyone need that

2014-09-17 13:17:46	tamgc	lulz, most people just use them as banners, but they're about the right size for fold out tables

2014-09-17 13:19:53	relsqui	that has a long mat on it
2014-09-17 13:20:05	dom	yeah, I dont like that one
2014-09-17 13:20:07	relsqui	haha
2014-09-17 13:20:08	relsqui	why?
2014-09-17 13:20:09	dom	just use a fucking tablecloth
2014-09-17 13:20:24	dom	its long long enough to hang off the edge, and yet its too big to be anywhere but
2014-09-17 13:20:34	dom	so it hangs off the edge and exposes the other side
2014-09-17 13:20:51	dom	also playmat material is something that doesn't feel right to play on, idk

2014-09-18 15:10:53	Takua	If I said VMware...but then threw in Oracle...except that it's Xen instead of VMware that Oracle turned into their VM environment...

2014-09-19 13:53:43	 *	relsqui would totally learn what I assume is haskell syntax from comparing it to python syntax
2014-09-19 13:53:57	relsqui	I guess that wasn't python
2014-09-19 13:54:10	kendall	the first one is *insert imperative language here*
2014-09-19 13:54:12	relsqui	yeah
2014-09-19 13:54:19	relsqui	it's imperative pseudocode, which is to say, it's very nearly python
2014-09-19 13:54:28	kendall	although you could do the second one in python too
2014-09-19 13:54:31	relsqui	yes
2014-09-19 13:54:32	kendall	it has enough funlang features
2014-09-19 13:54:48	kendall	\person-> == lambda person:
2014-09-19 13:55:29	kendall	the other thing that makes haskell hard to read for people use to python, C etc is that function application does not require parentheses
2014-09-19 13:55:36	relsqui	yeah, I worked that one out

2014-09-25 17:00:10	@bajr	dom: only for about 3-4 drinks worth of alcohol... gummi bears are soluble in alcohol, and would therefore increase blood-glucose to fatal levels

2014-09-25 17:52:43	relsqui	is bd orientation considered professional enough that I shouldn't say "asshole" in a talk
2014-09-25 17:52:54	relsqui	my instinct is yes but I can't think of a more polite way to reword it which is anywhere near as funny
2014-09-25 17:53:47	dom	jerk? whats context
2014-09-25 17:54:51	 *	bajr ponders this
2014-09-25 17:54:55	dom	(jerk is a suggestion to reword it to, not an accusation)
2014-09-25 17:55:45	relsqui	"I remember at our induction, almost a year ago, standing behind this guy in line to get my picture. He was showing off his fancy laptop to someone, and also complaining about how inefficient the induction process was. I was like, dang, what an asshole. So I did the only logical thing and proceeded to spend half my free time with him for the following year."
2014-09-25 17:56:10	relsqui	I haven't actually decided whether to use that or not but I think it's funny
2014-09-25 17:56:30	relsqui	I repeated this to mancat yesterday and he was like "... that's a pretty good introduction to the nix team, actually"
2014-09-25 17:56:46	relsqui	which is funnier to us but not at all to zombies, lol
2014-09-25 17:56:48	relsqui	or proto-zombies
2014-09-25 17:57:13	dom	I think assholes is fine in bd orientation
2014-09-25 17:57:29	dom	but im way more lax in professional vernacular
2014-09-25 17:57:33	dom	and im also not bajr
2014-09-25 17:57:35	@bajr	i would wager that it's fine. it's not like we're actually a professional organization (or pretending to be)

2014-09-28 12:20:10	relsqui	figured I'd wake up at like, 6

2014-09-28 19:07:00	relsqui	how come?
2014-09-28 19:07:06	@bajr	and one of the classes I'm taking is once again using their books
2014-09-28 19:07:39	sabreman	they publish a shit ton of books
2014-09-28 19:07:45	sabreman	so not surprising
2014-09-28 19:08:01	sabreman	i'd sasy like, 85% of the classes iv'e had have used their books
2014-09-28 19:08:11	sabreman	also clases start tommorow D:
2014-09-28 19:08:14	sabreman	and :D
2014-09-28 19:08:24	sabreman	it's an empotional mix
2014-09-28 19:08:42	@bajr	because they sell themselves to universities with subpar textbooks and (often) sell these books together with "computer-aided learning software" that students often can't opt out of
2014-09-28 19:09:21	@bajr	so instead of spending a reasonable $20-80 for used books, students are often stuck spending $200 for shitty books (or $70 if they want to "rent")
2014-09-28 19:09:54	@bajr	s/subpar/their subpar/
2014-09-28 19:10:39	@bajr	and their software is often poorly made and buggy

2014-09-28 19:13:25	sabreman	I agree, that's why i get as many of my textbooks from.... less-then-reputable sources
2014-09-28 19:13:29	sabreman	or at least try
2014-09-28 19:13:37	@bajr	last time, for chemistry, the book could *only* be purchased through the PSU bookstore in order for the software to work. and PSU bookstore mark-up is exorbitant
2014-09-28 19:13:39	sabreman	I think i've on;y ever had to by one textbook so far
2014-09-28 19:15:46	@bajr	going to talk to the instructor before purchasing the book, see if there's *some* workaround
2014-09-28 19:16:32	@bajr	older edition, opt out of software, photocopy sections from library's textbook
2014-09-28 19:16:45	relsqui	I emailed both of my ling profs this quarter and asked if I could use an earlier edition

2014-09-28 21:53:07	@bajr	So, rules as written for GURPS: If someone dodges your slam, you move "at least two yards past them if you have movement" and roll for hitting the wrong target, if applicable
2014-09-28 21:55:04	@bajr	can't determine if that's a meter immediately behind them, or the meter after that

2014-09-28 23:26:05	relsqui	grammatically, I mean
2014-09-28 23:26:13	relsqui	in english it's annoying but in hebrew it's basically impossible
2014-09-28 23:26:29	relsqui	since verbs are gendered

2014-09-29 02:18:29	@bajr	presuming, that is, that the particle actually collides with the player and distributes *all* of its kinetic energy to that player
2014-09-29 02:19:30	@bajr	rather than, you know, meeting with the laws of physics and vaporizing the player on the spot
2014-09-29 07:09:36	relsqui	XD
2014-09-29 08:10:52	mancat	bajr: your system has a function for determining damage from mass impact that calculates by the gram?
2014-09-29 08:11:01	mancat	are you *sure* this is less complex than gurps?
2014-09-29 08:26:02	@bajr	mancat: no :D

2014-09-29 08:31:17	@bajr	yeah i'm not sure, but I *am* sure it's the same variety of complexity
2014-09-29 08:31:52	@bajr	current system is (HP * Relative Velocity) / 100 dice

2014-09-29 08:39:59	mancat	(fun)/(complexity) = 1
2014-09-29 08:40:09	relsqui	accurate models of people are boring
2014-09-29 08:40:10	mancat	accuracy is just unrelated to fun
2014-09-29 08:40:12	relsqui	you deal with those every day
2014-09-29 08:40:14	mancat	^
2014-09-29 08:40:23	relsqui	and mostly they're not dramatic or heroic
2014-09-29 08:40:24	@bajr	players and gms should have an expectation that the rules of physics should be approximate until such a point as suspension of disbelief is permitted through powers or magic
2014-09-29 08:40:26	relsqui	or adventurous
2014-09-29 08:40:38	mancat	bullshit
2014-09-29 08:40:51	@bajr	gurps' current system is below expectations
2014-09-29 08:40:52	mancat	players and GMs should agree on a general set of guidelines for how things should work
2014-09-29 08:41:02	mancat	that set of guidelines doesn't have to be anything like physics
2014-09-29 08:41:33	mancat	incidentally, real life is extremely complex, which is why it takes most people a dozen or more years to learn how to operate responsibly under those rules
2014-09-29 08:41:48	mancat	if you want to play a physics simulation game you should be playing football
2014-09-29 08:42:01	relsqui	ha
2014-09-29 08:42:39	mancat	or, like, half life
2014-09-29 08:42:51	kendall	(garry's mod)
2014-09-29 08:42:56	relsqui	kendall++
2014-09-29 08:42:57	mancat	^
2014-09-29 08:43:27	@bajr	k, so before you rip me a new one, i think you misunderstand my goal, i feel the reaction here is hostile
2014-09-29 08:43:40	mancat	u_u
2014-09-29 08:43:46	mancat	i'm not trying to be hostile
2014-09-29 08:43:47	kendall	incidentally I can attest that the physics simulation parts of actual half-life are great, because of that one time I was crouched in a corner hammering poison headcrabs with the gravity gun, screaming to myself
2014-09-29 08:44:44	mancat	i don't want you to spend weeks on designing a new system only to find that no one wants to play it because it's even more strangled by tables and bookkeping than the old one
2014-09-29 08:45:01	mancat	i want you and your players to have fun and be happy ^_^;
2014-09-29 08:45:27	mancat	tabletops are better with a light-weight set of rules that everyone can agree on and that provide a loose structure on which to hang a story
2014-09-29 08:45:54	mancat	the story is the fun part, not rolling dice to figure out if you die
2014-09-29 08:46:11	@bajr	right, but I *do* want the system to at least somewhat resemble reality. Let the suspension of disbelief come after the *simple*, *non-complex* system establishes the basic rules
2014-09-29 08:46:13	mancat	numbers games can be fun, but computers are de facto better at managing them, so video games are a better format for that
2014-09-29 08:46:24	mancat	ok cool
2014-09-29 08:46:26	mancat	but i mean
2014-09-29 08:47:04	mancat	you turned (X + Y / 100) into (X + Y + Z^2 / 50)
2014-09-29 08:47:07	mancat	sec, phone
2014-09-29 08:47:13	@bajr	my equation up there isn't what I'm going to implement, but it was a fun little exercise in how far i could take it
2014-09-29 08:47:51	@bajr	something of a goal that I want the actual implementation to approach, but with much less
2014-09-29 08:48:23	kendall	I think a fun way to introduce mathematical complexity into a tabletop game would be to make a device with a big red button that runs the numbers and then goes "KABLAMMO" or something cool
2014-09-29 08:48:52	kendall	that way you can practice your EE skills at the same time!
2014-09-29 08:49:01	kendall	and nobody has to do math.
2014-09-29 08:58:23	@bajr	in other news, I like ruskiewicz as an instructor
2014-09-29 08:58:32	 *	mancat back
2014-09-29 08:58:40	mancat	sorry for unloading on you
2014-09-29 08:59:22	@bajr	no worries
2014-09-29 08:59:52	mancat	obviously you're perfectly justified in doing whatever you want to do, i'm just trying to share my advice :D
2014-09-29 09:00:04	 *	bajr nods.
2014-09-29 09:01:21	@bajr	like I said, I want my system to be more complex than, say, BESM, but less than what GURPS is now, thus why I specified that I'm just stretching the bounds a bit to see where things can go
2014-09-29 09:02:22	mancat	for the record i think like 92% of all tabletops fall somewhere in between those two points
2014-09-29 09:04:35	tamgc	keep in mind complexity is a multi-dimensional thing
2014-09-29 09:04:58	tamgc	mancat: nah, 91.9%
2014-09-29 09:05:00	tamgc	=P
2014-09-29 09:05:42	mancat	tamgc: i refuse to work with point values that small! :P
2014-09-29 09:05:43	mancat	too complex
2014-09-29 09:05:46	tamgc	(also the ability to handle said complexity on whichever dimensions is based on the players)
2014-09-29 09:05:52	tamgc	heh
2014-09-29 09:10:24	@bajr	how about somewhere between D&D and GURPS >.> that's probably about... 50-60% of games
2014-09-29 09:10:56	mancat	depends which edition you're talking about >_>
2014-09-29 09:11:04	mancat	the space between 2.5 and GURPS is pretty small, lol
2014-09-29 09:11:11	mancat	4th and basic set are a lot simpler
2014-09-29 09:11:23	@bajr	my point of reference is 3.5
2014-09-29 09:11:40	mancat	fair enough
2014-09-29 09:14:51	@bajr	never actually did anything with 2/2.5, what was it like?
2014-09-29 09:15:28	@bajr	s/was/is/
2014-09-29 09:33:35	mancat	fucking terrible
2014-09-29 09:34:08	mancat	it was my first tabletop system, so i was all about it for years
2014-09-29 09:34:27	mancat	i knew the layout of most of the rulesbooks by heart, and had memorized most of the tables
2014-09-29 09:34:37	mancat	but then i leraned about better systems
2014-09-29 09:35:18	@bajr	sounds intensive
2014-09-29 09:59:10	Takua	Wow.  I came into fun things this morning!
2014-09-29 10:12:23	relsqui	oh fuck this class moved
2014-09-29 10:12:24	relsqui	@_@
2014-09-29 10:12:31	 *	relsqui scampers
2014-09-29 10:31:20	 *	relsqui just did something scary and is proud of themselves
2014-09-29 10:31:36	Fetter	what sort of scary?
2014-09-29 10:33:04	relsqui	Hebrew teacher was introducing himself and teaching us to introduce ourselves to each other
2014-09-29 10:33:08	relsqui	and ask who each other was (were?)
2014-09-29 10:33:17	relsqui	"ani ____. mi at?"
2014-09-29 10:33:19	relsqui	or "mi atah?"
2014-09-29 10:33:27	relsqui	and to each of the men he said "mi ata?"
2014-09-29 10:34:17	relsqui	and to each of the women he said "mi at?"
2014-09-29 10:34:22	relsqui	and I'm wincing a little
2014-09-29 10:34:29	relsqui	and because of the order he's going in I'm dead last, and this is kind of awkward
2014-09-29 10:34:39	relsqui	so he comes around to me and says "mi at?"
2014-09-29 10:34:43	relsqui	"ata, bevakasha"
2014-09-29 10:34:46	relsqui	(bevakasha means please)
2014-09-29 10:34:50	relsqui	and he kinda blinks
2014-09-29 10:34:58	relsqui	"slicha?"
2014-09-29 10:35:01	relsqui	"ata, bevakasha"
2014-09-29 10:35:10	relsqui	"oh. ok. mi ata?"
2014-09-29 10:35:13	relsqui	":) mi Finn"
2014-09-29 10:35:33	Fetter	cool
2014-09-29 10:35:36	Fetter	that is scary
2014-09-29 10:35:37	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-29 10:35:38	@bajr	(slicha?)
2014-09-29 10:35:38	Fetter	good job!

2014-09-29 14:28:42	sabreman	kk, thanks
2014-09-29 14:57:49	relsqui	another good thing about that hebrew class
2014-09-29 14:58:04	relsqui	professor comes in and starts chatting to us in Hebrew
2014-09-29 14:58:08	relsqui	as he's setting up slides and stuff
2014-09-29 14:58:49	relsqui	I get a word or two here or there but nothing semantic, he's not speaking-to-students he's just talking naturally
2014-09-29 14:58:54	relsqui	and students are like o____o
2014-09-29 14:58:58	relsqui	eventually he finishes putting his presentation up
2014-09-29 14:59:03	relsqui	and the first slide says
2014-09-29 14:59:07	relsqui	"Don't worry, we'll start talking in English eventually."
2014-09-29 14:59:08	relsqui	XD
2014-09-29 14:59:16	relsqui	and then he proceeds to stick to Hebrew a few minutes longer and eventually switch
2014-09-29 14:59:19	relsqui	I was a little disappointed, honestly
2014-09-29 14:59:19	relsqui	immersion++
2014-09-29 14:59:20	relsqui	lol
2014-09-29 15:04:37	dom	immersion is great for teaching language but too often its done too soon for a class and they pick up 1 word in 8 of the professor
2014-09-29 15:04:46	dom	and then just shut down and dont learn anything else
2014-09-29 15:05:07	dom	yeah in the real world itd be immersion or pantomime, but a class isn't the real world
2014-09-29 15:07:53	relsqui	mm. I disagree with you, from my own experience, and I think the research also does
2014-09-29 15:08:54	dom	yeah, I mesh with it well, and i've had good experiences with it
2014-09-29 15:09:13	dom	but ive also been in a ton of language classes where it thins from 30 to 4 and the professor over a week
2014-09-29 15:09:22	dom	because they can't learn via immersion
2014-09-29 15:13:20	relsqui	take your word I guess
2014-09-29 15:13:44	dom	I just think it comes in too early
2014-09-29 15:13:53	dom	it doesn't belong in 2nd class of french 101
2014-09-29 15:14:34	relsqui	still not sure I agree! at least not inherently. you can't teach it exactly as you would in english, immersively, sure
2014-09-29 15:15:49	dom	the immersion I've experienced is "total immersion" where the professor refuses to speak with you in any language except x
2014-09-29 15:15:54	dom	including in emails
2014-09-29 15:16:58	dom	its really hard to learn verbs when they wont tell what tense they're for, too
2014-09-29 15:17:06	relsqui	yeah, that's what I'm talking about
2014-09-29 15:18:15	relsqui	I'm willing to believe my experiences were unusually good :)
2014-09-29 15:18:27	relsqui	actually now that I think about it, it wasn't totally immersive because there was a textbook
2014-09-29 15:18:30	relsqui	for a language which has no written form
2014-09-29 15:18:31	relsqui	lol
2014-09-29 15:18:33	dom	im willing to believe my experience with that prof was unusually bad
2014-09-29 15:18:43	dom	because when I learned spanish it was better
2014-09-29 15:18:48	dom	and they used immersion as well
2014-09-29 15:19:27	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-29 15:19:34	relsqui	yeah, I mean, again, you have to teach for it specifically
2014-09-29 15:19:39	dom	yeah
2014-09-29 15:19:39	relsqui	and that's *hard*
2014-09-29 15:19:47	relsqui	my ASL teacher was really, strikingly good
2014-09-29 15:20:01	dom	this prof was like "i translated my english curriculum into french, kek"
2014-09-29 15:20:20	relsqui	I'm not sad she retired because I'm sure she's earned it, but it's sad for the people who otherwise would've been her students :)
2014-09-29 15:20:27	askore	I took spanish immersively for a while, it went pretty well
2014-09-29 15:20:37	relsqui	(the textbook we used was written by professors at my community college. it's used *here*)
2014-09-29 15:20:38	askore	(in that I learned a lot, although i haven't retained a lot of it)
2014-09-29 15:20:41	 *	relsqui nods
2014-09-29 15:20:47	relsqui	I miss spanish
2014-09-29 15:20:56	dom	i didn't retain a ton of french or spanish
2014-09-29 15:20:57	relsqui	I studied it long enough that I don't think I'll ever forget the basics but it's kinda rusty
2014-09-29 15:21:01	askore	ya, true
2014-09-29 15:21:17	askore	I can translate some stuff and grok basic grammar structure, it's specific nouns & verbs I don't know now
2014-09-29 15:21:26	relsqui	yeah, vocab is always the hard part
2014-09-29 15:21:29	relsqui	uh
2014-09-29 15:21:32	relsqui	well, maybe not always
2014-09-29 15:21:36	relsqui	hebrew grammar is complicated, lol
2014-09-29 15:21:54	askore	heh
2014-09-29 15:22:32	dom	vocab is just basic memorization at the end, if you understand the way the language goes together and grammar and stuff
2014-09-29 15:22:42	relsqui	yah
2014-09-29 18:27:45	kendall	whatever happened to #bicycle. it's all empty now. :(

2014-09-30 09:05:12	askore	luckily cough is all that's left
2014-09-30 09:06:18	tamgc	\o/ (although coughing could be bad still...)
2014-09-30 09:07:35	askore	it's a good cough, and I'd rather that than congestion
2014-09-30 09:07:54	 *	askore -> breakfast
2014-09-30 09:08:10	tamgc	yay for...good...coughs =)
2014-09-30 09:13:39	kendall	(spicy food)++ makes a good expectorant
2014-09-30 09:15:11	tamgc	so you're saying we should've saved the ghost pepper/whiskey scorpion jerkies for askore to try
2014-09-30 09:15:26	kendall	what is that even
2014-09-30 09:15:28	kendall	jesus
2014-09-30 09:16:01	tamgc	heh last Friday, wasn't that bad
2014-09-30 09:16:21	kendall	sounds like something you take out into the desert and trip out on
2014-09-30 09:17:19	kendall	we can't stop here, this is ghost pepper whiskey scorpion jerky country
2014-09-30 09:17:33	tamgc	I think it was probably a lot mellower than the straight pepeprs...being infused in food...
2014-09-30 09:17:42	tamgc	kendall++
2014-09-30 09:18:07	tamgc	(whiskey bbq/trinidad scorpion flavor btw)
2014-09-30 09:19:41	kendall	aw, scorpion's just a type of pepper
2014-09-30 09:19:47	kendall	I thought it was scorpion meat
2014-09-30 09:19:59	tamgc	heh yeah
2014-09-30 09:20:11	Fetter	i just go to baan thai and order hot
2014-09-30 09:20:16	Fetter	that cleans me out
2014-09-30 09:20:17	tamgc	I mean...people do eat scorpions, but not much to make into jerky...
2014-09-30 09:20:33	Fetter	just like military grade cs gas in the chamber
2014-09-30 09:20:37	Fetter	mmmm
2014-09-30 09:20:41	kendall	Fetter: yeah I was gonna suggest spicy pho, too
2014-09-30 09:20:56	Fetter	baan thai is super HOT
2014-09-30 09:21:02	kendall	pho hung is my go-to
2014-09-30 09:21:18	Fetter	i usually order medium+ which is hotter than most places maximum hotness
2014-09-30 09:21:25	tamgc	spicy pho's a different kind of burn
2014-09-30 09:21:45	Fetter	the spice is good!!!
2014-09-30 09:21:50	tamgc	and so is baan thai hot actually...(I think baan thai stuff is probably hotter than the ghost pepper jerky...)
2014-09-30 09:21:54	kendall	you can adjust pho spiciness to your taste at the table, which is nice
2014-09-30 09:22:07	kendall	I've never been to baan thai...should give it a shot.
2014-09-30 09:22:09	tamgc	the ghost pepper jerky was kind of a slow burn, was kind of nice
2014-09-30 09:22:25	Fetter	yeah, it's close
2014-09-30 09:22:27	tamgc	kendall: I suggest medium at most first...
2014-09-30 09:22:29	kendall	I have a history of eating things that are way too spicy and like, going into a trance
2014-09-30 09:23:04	kendall	c.f. the el jefe wings at fire on the mountain
2014-09-30 09:23:07	tamgc	heh, that sounds like the very hot option for baan thai
2014-09-30 09:23:43	tamgc	but yeah, if you do baan thai, do medium first to get a gauge
2014-09-30 09:23:48	kendall	yeah
2014-09-30 09:23:54	tamgc	I think their medium's about "very hot" for most other places
2014-09-30 09:24:08	kendall	I have a pretty high mental spice tolerance by my gut I think is getting tired of it
2014-09-30 09:24:14	kendall	s/by/but
2014-09-30 09:28:28	askore	lol, if I liked spicy food that would be a good idea
2014-09-30 09:28:49	askore	but mild+ at baan thai is my limit
2014-09-30 09:29:05	askore	(the spice level on most of their curries, by-the-by)
2014-09-30 09:29:27	tamgc	mild is like 'hot' for most places heh
2014-09-30 09:29:38	askore	sure
2014-09-30 09:30:29	askore	but i only get mild+ because I want curry; it still hurts

2014-10-02 19:38:39	tamgc	so, thinking either Talisman or Eclipse tomorrow (both "big" board games), any interest?
2014-10-02 20:18:42	tamgc	Talisman is sort of a around-the-board psuedo RPG (a little munchkin-esque, but not really vs players...it's sort of players vs board race situation...)
2014-10-02 20:18:50	tamgc	although you can play vs players
2014-10-02 20:19:07	tamgc	Eclipse is sort of a 4x space game (think Twilight Imperium...but faster)

2014-10-03 23:58:42	relsqui	I'd been telling them about how I am normally very relationship-focused and it's been strange to be less of that lately; I'm working a lot and don't, if I'm honest, have time for an intense romantic thing, but I'm actually feeling pretty okay about that and it's weird
2014-10-03 23:58:52	relsqui	and they were like "Well, yeah. Your primary partner is the CAT."

2014-10-04 00:16:30	relsqui	and my current schedule is a big challenge for me in that regard
2014-10-04 00:17:08	tamgc	heh same, the only way i did wellvwith homework was when a group depended on it...
2014-10-04 00:17:33	relsqui	yeah
2014-10-04 00:17:36	tamgc	tutoring (officially or unofficially) helps
2014-10-04 00:17:46	relsqui	how so?
2014-10-04 00:18:22	tamgc	cause you have to be sble to teach it, in a timely manner
2014-10-04 00:19:15	tamgc	i sort of just ended up dragging a group of people with me through classes -.-
2014-10-04 00:19:34	relsqui	heh
2014-10-04 00:19:43	relsqui	that works if the thing is comprehension

2014-10-04 00:19:48	relsqui	but it doesn't help me actually *get my homework done*
2014-10-04 00:19:55	relsqui	because to do that I need time by myself
2014-10-04 00:20:05	relsqui	which nothing in my life provides right now, I have to remember to carve it out :P

2014-10-04 20:57:52	mancat	heh
2014-10-04 20:57:58	askore	mhm
2014-10-04 20:58:24	askore	when I was an incoming zombie we had to fill out the forms before induction day and then bring them to the desk
2014-10-04 20:58:35	askore	....but then there was still a whole thing making accounts so I don't really know?
2014-10-04 20:58:37	askore	meh
2014-10-04 20:59:53	mancat	that was truly a terrible falafel

2014-10-04 22:23:13	mancat	summation notation is absurd
2014-10-04 22:25:17	mancat	some crazy guy with a ruffly collar probably had to walk up a stone tower to work on a math problem, and when he got there he was like "zounds, walking up all those stairs was like adding up all these numbers"
2014-10-04 22:26:20	dom	kek
2014-10-04 22:26:50	mancat	then he was like "i should make a new notation where i start at the beginning at the bottom, and climb through all these numbers i have to add lke i'm climbing stairs. then i'll note the stopping point at the top. the comparison is obvious"
2014-10-04 22:27:26	dom	"obvi"
2014-10-04 22:27:45	mancat	also he was a shitty architect so his tower was super fucking crooked and looked like a capital sigma when he drew a picture of it

2014-10-06 08:52:20	@bajr	otters++
2014-10-06 08:52:32	@bajr	chanserv says it lets you topic
2014-10-06 08:52:43	relsqui	it's lying
2014-10-06 08:52:54	relsqui	oh
2014-10-06 08:52:55	relsqui	lol
2014-10-06 08:52:57	relsqui	on the CHANNEL it does
2014-10-06 08:52:58	relsqui	:P
2014-10-06 08:53:03	@bajr	lol
2014-10-06 08:53:04	relsqui	I have nfi what it does on users, if anything
2014-10-06 08:53:29	relsqui	also I dunno why this network is allergic to -t
2014-10-06 08:53:50	relsqui	I'm used to politely anarchic topics and that works well
2014-10-06 08:54:09	--	ChanServ has changed topic for #tabletop from "Library: http://goo.gl/8Sswfd" to "test"
2014-10-06 08:54:53	@bajr	relsqui: you still can't topic?
2014-10-06 08:55:03	relsqui	correct
2014-10-06 08:55:09	relsqui	because the channel is +t and I do not have ops

2014-10-06 08:55:22	relsqui	...
2014-10-06 08:55:22	askore	relsqui: it's probably because this network spirals out from the central point of #hack, into a couple major work channels and then to social channels where nobody knkws how to op properly
2014-10-06 08:55:37	relsqui	bajr: what are you basing that on
2014-10-06 08:55:43	relsqui	askore: lol

2014-10-06 09:26:19	mancat	or is it just a 'test it and find out" kind of thing?
2014-10-06 09:33:24	@bajr	there's a button in crack, but I'm not sure who has access to it, also CRACK sometimes doesn't reflect what their actual access is
2014-10-06 09:43:34	drbop	bajr: Know if we'll be GURPSing this Wednesday?
2014-10-06 10:21:20	Fox	mancat bajr: CRACK reflects card access granted by Student Services, but not by the CAT, ME, or other organizations.

2014-10-06 10:27:00	Takua	I honestly would probably feel a bit better about it if my bed were better.  But my sleep was so bad last night that I actually looked forward to waking up at 7 AM for a conference call.
2014-10-06 10:27:55	tamgc	karmabot: Takua is looks forward to 7AM conference calls

2014-10-06 10:28:31	Fox	Ouch. ;-;
2014-10-06 10:28:31	@bajr	my classroom is shaking....
2014-10-06 10:28:32	tamgc	Fox: the other people are probably in the future and give zero fucks about you

2014-10-06 10:30:16	Takua	Yeah.  7 AM.  Because of conference calls with Europe...
2014-10-06 10:30:35	Fox	Ah. More sense is made now.
2014-10-06 10:30:53	Takua	tamgc: That's a mean paraphrase
2014-10-06 10:49:52	@bajr	drbop: to answer your question, yeah, game is canceled until bajr becomes less busy
2014-10-06 11:37:13	@relsqui	at the risk of implying a number of amusing things which aren't true

2014-10-06 12:08:11	Takua	If I were at home, it would be amazing
2014-10-06 12:25:00	@relsqui	and yeah, I kinda felt like that when we were camping
2014-10-06 12:25:08	@relsqui	easy to get up at seven because bed wasn't that comfy, lol
2014-10-06 12:25:13	@relsqui	there might be a lesson here for my general sleeping habits
2014-10-06 12:26:43	Takua	No, it's really not
2014-10-06 12:26:54	Takua	Because it so hurts your ability to remain awake later in the day
2014-10-06 12:28:25	nibalizer	Takua: have you been shipped out to random places again?
2014-10-06 12:28:35	Takua	nibalizer: Phoenix again

2014-10-06 16:10:20	@relsqui	agh I'm supposed to hear overtones in these words
2014-10-06 16:10:22	@relsqui	for phonetics
2014-10-06 16:10:25	@relsqui	I can't hear these p_q
2014-10-06 16:17:44	jesusaurus	overtones?
2014-10-06 16:18:16	jesusaurus	are those different than tones?
2014-10-06 16:19:46	dom	overtones are the surveyors of the tones
2014-10-06 16:19:49	dom	the supervisors
2014-10-06 16:19:57	dom	they wield whips and rule with an iron fist
2014-10-06 16:26:14	@relsqui	^
2014-10-06 16:28:24	@relsqui	jesusaurus: yeah. at least, I think I'm supposed to be hearing overtones? the book is asking me which formants sound similar to the formants in x word
2014-10-06 16:28:39	@relsqui	and I am like, wat
2014-10-06 16:28:43	@relsqui	I thought formant is thing I can see on spectrogram
2014-10-06 16:28:45	@relsqui	not thing I can hear
2014-10-06 16:29:21	dom	you got to feel the science
2014-10-06 16:29:24	dom	not know the science
2014-10-06 16:29:25	dom	gosh
2014-10-06 16:32:20	jesusaurus	relsqui: well, its both, right? a spectrogram is just a visual representation of audio
2014-10-06 16:33:00	@relsqui	right
2014-10-06 16:33:06	@relsqui	but I have no idea wtf I'm physically listening for
2014-10-06 16:33:14	jesusaurus	you can hear the difference between a young boy and a grown man, thats just f0 lowering
2014-10-06 16:33:30	@relsqui	sure, but same speaker with different vowel
2014-10-06 16:33:44	@relsqui	... they have different qualities, I guess, which comes from the formants
2014-10-06 16:33:58	@relsqui	but I don't know what it means when it says to listen for and compare those, vs. just listening to the *sounds*
2014-10-06 16:34:19	jesusaurus	right, the vowels can be plotted on a graph with f1 on the x and f2 on the y
2014-10-06 16:34:49	jesusaurus	and thats where you get the not-quite-square shape of the high-low/front-back vowels
2014-10-06 16:35:37	jesusaurus	you can also normalize the graph for populations>1 by using f1/f2 on the y and its surprisingly the same shape
2014-10-06 16:36:41	@relsqui	yeah, *seeing* them makes perfect sense to me
2014-10-06 16:36:42	@relsqui	or, well
2014-10-06 16:36:52	@relsqui	enough sense, given that the first time I encountered this entire concept was a couple of hours ago
2014-10-06 16:37:56	@relsqui	jesusaurus: to clarify, the actual exercise I'm supposed to be doing is #I here http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/acip/course/chapter1/chapter1.exercises.htm

2014-10-06 16:38:17	@relsqui	and I just don't really comprehend what it's asking me to do
2014-10-06 16:40:02	jesusaurus	ah, so its trying to get you to hear the separate frequencies that make up the vowels
2014-10-06 16:40:14	jesusaurus	its not easy to do
2014-10-06 16:40:27	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-06 16:40:54	@relsqui	I am ... confused and frustrated, I don't know what I'm listening for and can't hear it
2014-10-06 16:41:25	@relsqui	the book actually describes what I'm meant to be hearing in some of the sample words
2014-10-06 16:41:34	@relsqui	and I just can't make any match between the description and my actual perception
2014-10-06 16:41:34	jesusaurus	and its even harder if you're trying to listen to yourself rather than a recording :(
2014-10-06 16:41:41	@relsqui	we do have recordings
2014-10-06 16:41:52	@relsqui	um, here http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/acip/course/chapter1/example1_5.html

2014-10-06 17:24:52	@relsqui	O_O this is why it sounds off when two people sing the same pitch on different vowels!
2014-10-06 17:24:55	@relsqui	different overtones because of the formants!

2014-10-07 11:47:47	@bajr	to be fair, it's the kind of machine that only heavy-weight companies would use. Google could probably use it and max it out

2014-10-07 12:33:25	Takua	I was going to say, use a flash rom?
2014-10-07 12:47:09	nibalizer	jesusaurus: why ssd for the os? why not just pxe boot a golden image into tempfs  a la smartos?
2014-10-07 12:47:34	jesusaurus	that too
2014-10-07 12:48:38	jesusaurus	i was thinking coreos on ssd and let etcd set up everything in a tmpfs, but you can just as easily pxe bootstrap into the system
2014-10-07 12:59:25	nibalizer	ya
2014-10-07 12:59:29	nibalizer	we should fuck with coreos soon
2014-10-07 12:59:41	nibalizer	when you move down here we can go to psu and load some shit in the combs with a coreos cluster

2014-10-08 15:35:27	@relsqui	he told us that today and the whole class was like "OHHHHHH"

2014-10-08 15:36:38	@relsqui	a couple of people recommended against taking phonetics with him, but afaict no one else is teaching it these days
2014-10-08 15:36:47	@relsqui	apparently he's great for things that are less concrete, like socioling
2014-10-08 15:37:11	jesusaurus	i really like tucker
2014-10-08 15:38:39	jesusaurus	if you ever want to derail a class, ask him about how to pronounce mbŋg
2014-10-08 15:38:49	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-10-08 15:38:57	@relsqui	is that the labial-velar nasal?
2014-10-08 15:39:03	@relsqui	if so it totally came up today
2014-10-08 15:39:10	jesusaurus	haha really?
2014-10-08 15:39:21	@relsqui	yes XD we were talking about [w]
2014-10-08 15:39:30	@relsqui	and the ... I was about to say double articulation, that means something else
2014-10-08 15:39:32	@relsqui	the two places of articulation
2014-10-08 15:39:42	jesusaurus	about the three words it exists in? on is type of tree and another is a type of bug only found in that type of tree, i think the third was a bush
2014-10-08 15:39:45	@relsqui	"English only does this for a glide, but kisi has a stop and a nasal ..."
2014-10-08 15:39:48	jesusaurus	african languages are weird
2014-10-08 15:39:56	@relsqui	he didn't go into that much detail, no
2014-10-08 15:39:58	@relsqui	we were just about out of time
2014-10-08 15:40:02	@relsqui	that's great though
2014-10-08 15:40:03	jesusaurus	ah...
2014-10-08 15:40:23	@relsqui	it's week two and the running gag of "in this obscure west African langauge ..." is well established though
2014-10-08 15:40:31	@relsqui	not even gag, just
2014-10-08 15:40:37	@relsqui	he always says that exactly that way so we always know what's coming :)
2014-10-08 15:40:49	@relsqui	oh, he did a good demo for the formants, too
2014-10-08 15:40:50	jesusaurus	well, thats what he did. he went to africa and studied kisi
2014-10-08 15:40:53	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-08 15:41:02	jesusaurus	he's some sort of expert on the language

2014-10-09 15:24:10	tamgc	it's *a* solution =P
2014-10-09 15:24:37	tamgc	can't remember if notepad++ does string substitutions like that
2014-10-09 15:24:51	stormcrow	I'm pretty sure you can get some unix utilities for Windows. I seem to remember installing grep and sed (among others) on my desktop at home...
2014-10-09 15:24:56	mancat	not even a comparison
2014-10-09 15:25:09	mancat	there's regex substitution, and then there's sed scripts
2014-10-09 15:25:50	 *	mancat wants to be a sed hacker when he grows up

2014-10-09 15:42:47	Takua	Still in hell
2014-10-09 15:42:52	Takua	A hell that hit me with overdraft fees
2014-10-09 15:43:08	@bajr	Takua: the worst kind of hell
2014-10-09 15:44:16	Takua	tl;dr: I thought the company was supposed to pay for hotel and car directly.  They weren't.  I had $2,223 that the company owed me from two trips and didn't know about half of that.  My bank account can't handle that.
2014-10-09 15:44:32	Takua	Actually, more accurately, I didn't know about 2/3rds of that
2014-10-09 15:44:36	dom	:(((((((((
2014-10-09 15:45:22	tamgc	dafuq?
2014-10-09 15:45:30	tamgc	they better pay for overdraft fees then
2014-10-09 15:46:41	Takua	I'm trying to get rid of it
2014-10-09 15:47:00	Takua	Because it was a hold instead of a full charge...which still looks the same to the bank
2014-10-09 19:01:03	@relsqui	wth
2014-10-09 19:20:58	Takua	Yeah.  It was sucky.

2014-10-09 19:51:12	jesusaurus	unfortunately yes
2014-10-09 19:51:24	jesusaurus	but at least talking about c++ gives (c)++ karma

2014-10-09 19:56:15	tamgc	I'd say more pico+- level heh
2014-10-09 19:57:19	jesusaurus	seriously though, its a plain-old text editor with half a dozen key bindings. like nano.
2014-10-09 19:57:49	tamgc	there's half a dozen?
2014-10-09 20:03:18	jesusaurus	^a ^c ^v ^x ...
2014-10-09 20:03:22	jesusaurus	does it have ^z ?
2014-10-09 20:03:34	jesusaurus	is there a redo? its probably not ^y if there is...
2014-10-09 20:05:44	tamgc	nope no redo
2014-10-09 20:05:51	tamgc	just undo
2014-10-09 20:05:56	tamgc	(and un-undo heh)
2014-10-09 20:06:12	tamgc	but I kind of count all those as basic windows shortcuts
2014-10-09 20:14:21	jesusaurus	which is like the readline of the winders world

2014-10-11 11:44:55	Golem	I just had the strangest moment.  Im sitting in the tutor lounge, reading about dnd.  I have the urge to pick up a pen and click it, as I often do when I am designing a new campaign.  So I reach out, grab a pen, and click it.  
2014-10-11 11:45:17	Golem	The thing is.  Its not my pen.  Theres no one else here, and im pretty sure that pen wasnt there when I sat down
2014-10-11 11:46:03	Golem	And now I am left wondering if I managed to unconciously create matter by expectation, or if I am just so much of a yerf that I missed seeing that pen when I came in
2014-10-11 14:04:09	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-11 14:06:43	Golem	It was very strange to find myself with a pen, and no idea where said pen came from
2014-10-11 14:11:23	@relsqui	eee got my copy of the What If book
2014-10-11 14:11:27	@relsqui	I didn't realize how big it is!

2014-10-13 11:56:47	@relsqui	if anyone's near the srtc and wants a pizza slice, holler. else I'll probably eat it after class
2014-10-13 12:02:29	stormcrow	stand in the middle of the CS lounge and shout "FREE PIZZA!"
2014-10-13 12:02:50	stormcrow	then throw it straight up in the air and run before you get mauled by savage CS students
2014-10-13 12:03:30	@relsqui	if I were going to go all the way to fab I'd just give it to mancat :P
2014-10-13 12:04:32	stormcrow	that's way less of a spectacle, though
2014-10-13 12:04:59	@relsqui	besides, we tried that once (iirc at mancat's birthday?) and found the students too suspicious
2014-10-13 13:09:59	jesusaurus	too suspicious? or not properly motivated?
2014-10-13 14:05:13	sabreman	I haven't looked at irce in a week or so
2014-10-13 14:05:23	sabreman	Are we still not doing the gurps til next term?
2014-10-13 14:43:43	@relsqui	yep
2014-10-13 14:43:47	@relsqui	jesusaurus: that's true
2014-10-13 14:43:52	@relsqui	er, potentially true
2014-10-13 14:43:53	@relsqui	I mean
2014-10-13 14:44:00	@relsqui	jesusaurus: also hi! I'm sorry I didn't get to talk to you more around orientation :)

2014-10-13 15:22:21	jesusaurus	no worries, it was a super-quick visit. but hopefully in the next month-ish i'll be in pdx permenantly
2014-10-13 15:25:42	@bajr	sabreman: we are not gurpsing until I complete my quest for time
2014-10-13 15:36:09	stormcrow	all I want for christmas is 4 extra hours in the day and a reusable get-out-of-sleep-free card
2014-10-13 15:37:27	@relsqui	stormcrow++
2014-10-13 15:39:13	mancat	stormcrow++ i hear you buddy
2014-10-13 15:39:22	mancat	we should start an internet petition
2014-10-13 15:39:29	@relsqui	yes
2014-10-13 15:39:38	@relsqui	that's a good way to get tangible things accomplished
2014-10-13 15:39:54	mancat	*nod*
2014-10-13 15:41:21	@bajr	hmm, I feel as though 4 extra hours would lead to a *very* confusing time-keeping method. How about we subsitute that with a reduced expectation of productivity of 4 hours per day?
2014-10-13 15:42:09	@bajr	on the other hand, i suppose we could go to efforts to try to slow down earth's rotation...
2014-10-13 15:42:25	@bajr	yeah, i like that solution
2014-10-13 15:42:43	askore	hm how about this
2014-10-13 15:43:16	askore	you get 4 extra hours a day, but that time is subtly spread out durig the day and only occurs during the most boring parts
2014-10-13 15:43:57	drbop	Wouldn't slowing down the earth's rotation cause much more to happen than we get a few extra hours?
2014-10-13 15:44:27	askore	of course, but nothing was specofied in the wish about side-effects
2014-10-13 15:45:12	 *	drbop gets reminded of willyoupressthebutton.com
2014-10-13 16:31:14	hylleddin	Since nothing was specified, the side effects probably happen, don't they.

2014-10-13 20:04:13	@relsqui	in both cases, that has a bit to do with the kind of work available :P
2014-10-13 20:07:44	tamgc	well, if we ran on 24 hrs, instead of 8-10, we'd double our employment rates >.>
2014-10-13 20:27:28	nibalizer	tamgc: that would be werid because there would be people in your town you were off-cycle from

2014-10-15 08:43:53	askore	uh I have to remember what that is first
2014-10-15 08:45:31	@bajr	heh
2014-10-15 08:45:36	@bajr	so say we have t(n) - t(n-1) = t/(n(n+1))
2014-10-15 08:47:42	@bajr	so the char eq = (r - 1) (r - b) ^ (d +1)
2014-10-15 08:47:53	@bajr	what is d?
2014-10-15 08:48:17	tamgc	bajr wants the 'd' =P

2014-10-15 08:57:55	tamgc	heh yep
2014-10-15 08:58:47	tamgc	used to be fun, then slowly became an abyss somewhere in calc 2/3
2014-10-15 09:01:02	tamgc	(that and sleeping in half the classes prob didn't help)
2014-10-15 09:01:56	Fetter	it's all just make believe
2014-10-15 09:02:18	Fetter	if you start thinking about it like that, all the math after that becomes understandable
2014-10-15 09:02:19	Fetter	;-)
2014-10-15 09:03:00	Fetter	it simply needs to be a repeatable formula and ideally has some sort of functional purpose
2014-10-15 09:04:01	tamgc	heh yeah, repeatable formula's the easy part, functional purpose is what I think where calc level stuff got lost on me and I was like 'meh'
2014-10-15 09:10:28	Fetter	you have to take some sort of physics or chemistry or astronomy to go weith it
2014-10-15 09:10:33	Fetter	with
2014-10-15 09:13:43	tamgc	yeah, did the physics thing, but it was sort of a repeat of HS classes...so that probably didn't help...
2014-10-15 09:13:59	tamgc	(of HS classes, with less interesting implementation -.-)

2014-10-15 11:58:13	tamgc	heh
2014-10-15 11:58:29	tamgc	plaintext all the things, then format afterwards usually alleviates much pain
2014-10-15 13:06:04	hylleddin	markdown + mathjax. That's how it's done.

2014-10-16 10:17:25	Takua	Usually speaking, that's bad
2014-10-16 10:18:09	tamgc	sometimes work can be cathartic
2014-10-16 10:20:31	Takua	This is true
2014-10-16 10:21:55	Takua	Or just that you like your job.  SHOCKING I KNOW, but I hear rumors that this is possible
2014-10-16 10:21:58	@relsqui	it's mostly because this is the only time I'm awake that I don't feel like I should be doing homework
2014-10-16 10:22:08	@relsqui	and in fact, won't do it even if I have some to do
2014-10-16 10:22:12	@relsqui	because I'm being paid to do something else right now
2014-10-16 10:22:21	Takua	...well that works too, yes
2014-10-16 10:23:09	@relsqui	but also yes, my job is pretty fun and not that stressful
2014-10-16 10:23:24	@relsqui	<3 cat
2014-10-16 10:23:39	Takua	CAT++
2014-10-16 10:24:17	tamgc	ah yes, the time honored work to procrastinate on homework technique =)
2014-10-16 10:26:30	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-16 10:26:43	@relsqui	it's not even that, it just feels wrong to do it when I have actually work to do :)
2014-10-16 10:52:06	nibalizer	relsqui: tamgc tamgc yea i tend to talk about whatever on orientation night
2014-10-16 10:52:21	@relsqui	bot in other channel just now: "linguists like ambiguity more than most people"
2014-10-16 10:52:25	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-10-16 11:03:09	askore	hehehehe relsqui++
2014-10-16 11:05:49	 *	tamgc was hoping for a 'llama' acronymn for a sec...
2014-10-16 11:06:10	@relsqui	tamgc: linguists like ambiguity most of all?
2014-10-16 11:06:23	tamgc	relsqui++ better
2014-10-16 11:06:48	 *	relsqui ^_^
2014-10-16 11:28:04	jesusaurus	relsqui: heh awesome
2014-10-16 11:28:56	jesusaurus	and now im sitting here wondering why you lose the ambiguity if you s/ people$//
2014-10-16 11:30:15	askore	jesusaurus: probably because the thing you assume in place of 'people' isn't people, but linguists?
2014-10-16 11:30:20	askore	or
2014-10-16 11:30:22	askore	eh
2014-10-16 11:30:24	askore	not quite what I meant
2014-10-16 11:31:29	@relsqui	jesusaurus: oooh
2014-10-16 11:31:49	@relsqui	jesusaurus: I guess because that's the only way the phrase "more than most" is used?
2014-10-16 11:31:57	tamgc	so...you're saying...linguists aren't people?
2014-10-16 11:32:10	tamgc	=P
2014-10-16 11:32:12	@relsqui	that phrase is enough of a thing by itself to establish it as a constituent? I think?
2014-10-16 11:32:15	@relsqui	hold on
2014-10-16 11:32:19	 *	relsqui looks around for scratch paper
2014-10-16 11:32:42	stormcrow	jesusaurus: I'm pretty sure the ambiguity is still there
2014-10-16 11:32:56	 *	relsqui uses the back of some paper from syntax class, go fig
2014-10-16 11:33:49	jesusaurus	i think it has to do with the need for an explicit (shallow form?) reference
2014-10-16 11:34:27	jesusaurus	s/shallow form/surface structure/
2014-10-16 11:35:19	@relsqui	jesusaurus: say more?
2014-10-16 11:35:27	 *	relsqui stopped trying to tree this, it requires structures they don'tknow
2014-10-16 11:35:28	@relsqui	(I think)
2014-10-16 11:35:34	jesusaurus	im struggling to remember my syntax
2014-10-16 11:35:43	@relsqui	I'm in it right now but only in week three, so
2014-10-16 11:36:03	jesusaurus	if i were at home i would pull out my text, but i went to the office today
2014-10-16 11:36:11	@relsqui	hehe
2014-10-16 11:37:28	jesusaurus	if youre in class right now, you could sidetrack the whole class with the example...
2014-10-16 11:38:03	@relsqui	rofl, my professor has actually been very good about distinguishing between clarification questions and curiosity questions
2014-10-16 11:38:08	@relsqui	and punting the latter to break/office hours/email
2014-10-16 11:38:17	jesusaurus	sad times :(
2014-10-16 11:38:20	@relsqui	(hence why I emailed her at like 2am to be like "what's up with the word 'all' in 'all along the watchtower'"
2014-10-16 11:38:23	@relsqui	)
2014-10-16 11:38:39	dom	as opposed to some along the watchtower
2014-10-16 11:38:41	dom	obviouslt
2014-10-16 11:38:42	@relsqui	I actually really appreciate it, as much as I like going off on cool tangents we have a lot to cover in not a lot of time
2014-10-16 11:38:45	@relsqui	yes
2014-10-16 11:38:48	@relsqui	partway along the watchtower
2014-10-16 11:38:56	jesusaurus	deidrich wouldve ran with that example for a whole class
2014-10-16 11:39:21	@relsqui	hehehe
2014-10-16 11:39:27	@relsqui	I was just hearing good things about dietrich from protoben
2014-10-16 11:39:44	jesusaurus	he was awesome
2014-10-16 11:40:02	@relsqui	sounds like :)
2014-10-16 11:40:03	jesusaurus	i took syntax and also cognitive science from him
2014-10-16 11:40:09	@relsqui	I'm taking it from mittelstaedt right now and <3 her
2014-10-16 11:40:14	@relsqui	I might've told you that already
2014-10-16 11:40:28	jesusaurus	yeah, ive heard good things about her
2014-10-16 11:40:40	@relsqui	she is, like, the professor I wanna be when I grow up
2014-10-16 11:40:45	@relsqui	ish
2014-10-16 11:40:57	@relsqui	I suspect we're pretty similar personality-wise
2014-10-16 11:41:04	@relsqui	so I feel very at home in that class
2014-10-16 11:41:35	@relsqui	mostly it's just such a relief to be in a room full of people who are actually inclined to think about language the way I do >_>
2014-10-16 11:43:45	@relsqui	I was flapping at mancat about syntax trees yesterday
2014-10-16 11:43:48	@relsqui	not particularly successfully
2014-10-16 11:43:58	@relsqui	I don't know how to explain why they're cool because they're so inherently cool to me
2014-10-16 11:44:24	@relsqui	I've been working on the tree for the rules text of http://magiccards.info/uh/en/24.html
2014-10-16 11:44:26	link-bot	Ambiguity (Unhinged) (http://goo.gl/kkFHW0)
2014-10-16 11:53:24	jesusaurus	ive grown to tolerate x-bar, but when i first learned it i raged a bit because i dont think trees are the best graph structure to express the relationships
2014-10-16 11:53:38	jesusaurus	i think something more like uml could do a better job
2014-10-16 11:54:00	jesusaurus	but i can express x-bar easily with yaml, so thats a plus
2014-10-16 11:55:14	@bajr	good morning citizens
2014-10-16 11:57:34	@relsqui	bajr: o/
2014-10-16 11:57:44	@relsqui	jesusaurus: huh, not familiar with uml
2014-10-16 11:57:48	@relsqui	but instinctively I like x-bar
2014-10-16 11:58:17	@relsqui	one of the things I was flapping at mancat about is how you can put words in trees and then do math on the trees and grammar falls out
2014-10-16 11:59:02	@relsqui	I guess I can imagine what you mean about it not being a good way to express those relationships; the children of a given node aren't equal in basically any case
2014-10-16 12:04:43	jesusaurus	yeah, and the concepts you put at the root of the tree are rarely used for much and mostly just draw lines in the sand between different subtrees
2014-10-16 12:05:05	jesusaurus	to me, it makes more sense to use a more flexible unrooted acyclic graph
2014-10-16 12:12:14	@relsqui	interesting
2014-10-16 12:19:34	@relsqui	... okay I need to do my actual job for a minute >_>
2014-10-16 12:34:03	@relsqui	agh, how is it already 12:30 :(

2014-10-16 16:19:52	tamgc	d'aww sadly?

2014-10-16 16:21:42	@relsqui	and I wasn't expecting to want to do that
2014-10-16 16:21:59	@relsqui	it's a two hour rehearsal after a six hour block of day in which I don't have any breaks longer than a few minutes
2014-10-16 16:22:11	@relsqui	and eight hours without a significant gap is just too much
2014-10-16 16:22:21	tamgc	ah =/ def sounds like a bit of overload -.-
2014-10-16 16:22:28	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-16 16:24:37	@relsqui	I hadn't quite worded it that way before; "I have an eight hour day without a break in it" is a good enough reason for me
2014-10-16 16:24:40	@relsqui	blah
2014-10-16 16:24:42	@relsqui	it sucks, though

2014-10-19 00:15:10	@relsqui	it's culture death.
2014-10-19 00:15:20	@relsqui	(one of the reasons)
2014-10-19 00:15:50	mancat	also loss of extant bodies of info?
2014-10-19 00:15:54	@relsqui	yup.

2014-10-19 18:36:17	mancat	thanks, lol
2014-10-19 18:36:25	birdman	What do cats play?
2014-10-19 18:36:45	mancat	4th ed, GURPS, Exalted
2014-10-19 18:36:54	mancat	^ are among known played systems
2014-10-19 18:37:25	mancat	there may be more, i don't claim to know about all active rpg groups that cats are in
2014-10-19 18:40:21	mancat	i know we have people that play or have played 3.x, l5r, and other White Wolf systems too, but i don't think there are any active games in those right now
2014-10-19 18:40:22	birdman	Hmm. Heard of GURPS but not Exalted. GURPS is pretty hardcore, no?
2014-10-19 18:40:32	mancat	>_> depends who you ask
2014-10-19 18:40:44	birdman	Im a tabletop noob
2014-10-19 18:41:00	birdman	so checking out the options
2014-10-19 18:41:17	mancat	i feel that GURPS is being suffocated under the weight of the massive amount of bookkeeping and table-referencing involved in playing it
2014-10-19 18:41:50	mancat	it's kind of D&D-like, but oldschool and highly simulationist
2014-10-19 18:41:54	mancat	some people love it
2014-10-19 18:43:43	mancat	i tend to recommend 4th edition as a good place for tabletop nobs to get their feet wet, there's a pretty manageable amount of rules to know
2014-10-19 18:43:49	mancat	there are other good systems too
2014-10-19 18:44:20	mancat	no matter the system you choose, having a good group of people you like is the most important thing, especially if you're new
2014-10-19 18:44:54	mancat	lots of people have bad experiences and quit because their first few groups aren't really good about working together and being friendly to one another
2014-10-19 18:45:07	mancat	fortunately cats are mostly the kind of people i would recommend for this :)
2014-10-19 18:45:17	@relsqui	shucks. :)
2014-10-19 18:48:58	birdman	yeah they say 5th ed is really noob-friendly, but i wasn't sure if it would suck if i played with a bunch of other noobs. especially fi the DM is new too ...
2014-10-19 18:49:23	mancat	honestly i think that depends on your personality, but i think you're likely to have fun in a group like that
2014-10-19 18:49:30	mancat	as long as you don't mind if things are a little disorganized
2014-10-19 18:49:55	mancat	i haven't looked at 5th edition yet, but i wouldn't be at all surprised if it is pretty user-friendly, WotC has been trying to move things that way
2014-10-19 18:50:25	birdman	yeah, thats what theyre saying anyway. 
2014-10-19 18:51:32	mancat	user-friendly in this case is relative :D pretty much any tabletop system is gonna have a lot to know in it. but you can probably muddle your way through with a minimum of confusion and disorientation.
2014-10-19 18:51:44	mancat	exalted or GURPS would be a lot harder to figure out from a cold start ^_^;
2014-10-19 18:52:19	Pash	in practice, he easiest thing to learn is whatever system you can join an established group for
2014-10-19 18:52:25	mancat	yeah, that
2014-10-19 18:52:30	mancat	i generally feel that the most important thing is having fun. if there's a rule your group doesn't really understand or doesn't like, it's not important to follow it.
2014-10-19 18:52:51	mancat	tabletop games are really about group interaction. as long as eveyrone's happy that's all that really matters.
2014-10-19 18:52:58	@relsqui	^ and this is why I like playing with mancat
2014-10-19 18:53:59	mancat	also expec that if you're all learning you'll probably misread or just miss stuff, and over time you may start to notice that some of these things are important (like if you're accidentally finding 150 times too much gold, you'll very quickly be able to buy things you shouldn't be able to afford)
2014-10-19 18:54:24	mancat	so keeping that in mind, cut your DM some slack if they have to change osmehting after the fact to keep the game form falling apart
2014-10-19 18:56:31	mancat	or just roll with what you've created. it doesn't really matter, it's more art than science.
2014-10-19 19:05:08	birdman	cool. Thanks for the advice folks
2014-10-19 19:08:00	mancat	no problem :)

2014-10-21 22:44:07	Pash	Ah, the olden days
2014-10-21 22:44:18	@bajr	wheezl: yeah, rode to Prince Rupert
2014-10-21 22:44:21	@bajr	it was amazing
2014-10-21 22:44:27	wheezl	oh nice yo
2014-10-21 22:44:36	dom	I never regret hilighting on alaska
2014-10-21 22:45:18	@bajr	if they let me hold onto the talking stick long enough, i can tell stories of the adventure
2014-10-21 22:45:35	 *	dom sighs and lets bajr keep the stick
2014-10-21 22:45:53	@bajr	relsqui knows how long I can go at it >.>
2014-10-21 22:46:07	wheezl	alaska is wonderful

2014-10-21 22:46:32	dom	your loss
2014-10-21 22:46:35	@bajr	alaska is honestly the most beautiful place I think I've ever seen.
2014-10-21 22:46:41	@bajr	obviously i'm not very well traveled
2014-10-21 22:47:03	tombat	well tbh anywhere is an improvement over suburban IL
2014-10-21 22:47:05	wheezl	down in ketchikan we didn't get that much snow
2014-10-21 22:47:07	 *	relsqui <_<
2014-10-21 22:47:30	@bajr	wheezl: but shit-tons of rain :D
2014-10-21 22:47:35	dom	:D
2014-10-21 22:47:42	dom	I miss the shit-tons of snow
2014-10-21 22:47:54	wheezl	i love the rain tho
2014-10-21 22:47:59	wheezl	:D
2014-10-21 22:48:01	wheezl	rain so good
2014-10-21 22:48:08	@bajr	isn't ketchikan one of the wettest places on earth?
2014-10-21 22:48:15	wheezl	yup!
2014-10-21 22:48:22	@relsqui	we were seriously just talking about this, mancat and xoraxiom and I
2014-10-21 22:48:23	wheezl	rains about 300 days out of the year
2014-10-21 22:48:29	dom	its so wet
2014-10-21 22:48:32	Takua	Raiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnn
2014-10-21 22:48:32	dom	I love it
2014-10-21 22:48:51	wheezl	it's because ketchikan is located in the tongass national rainforest, one of the few temperate rainforests in the whole world!
2014-10-21 22:48:57	wheezl	truly a national treasure
2014-10-21 22:49:07	 *	wheezl ends tour guide mode
2014-10-21 22:49:10	dom	alaska = national treasure
2014-10-21 22:49:26	@relsqui	(your face is a national treasure)
2014-10-21 22:49:30	 *	relsqui contributes
2014-10-21 22:49:31	dom	"Here we see some Kodiak grizzlies. Pls do not walk any closer. Sir! SIR!"
2014-10-21 22:49:35	@relsqui	XD
2014-10-21 22:49:37	 *	dom ends tour guide mode
2014-10-21 22:49:41	wheezl	relsqui: aww
2014-10-21 22:49:51	mancat	(your face stars Nicholas Cage)
2014-10-21 22:49:56	@bajr	anyways, the reason I ended up doing the bike ride is because I wanted to prove I could go places by bicycle, since I don't have a license (a point folks still poke me about sometimes)
2014-10-21 22:49:57	@relsqui	mancat++
2014-10-21 22:50:14	dom	bajr: you should get a license
2014-10-21 22:50:18	dom	relsqui: ^
2014-10-21 22:50:24	@bajr	so doing a tour was always on my to-do list since I graduated highschool
2014-10-21 22:50:27	@relsqui	I want to!
2014-10-21 22:50:57	Pash	"Sir!  SIR!  Please don't feed the grizzlies!"
2014-10-21 22:50:58	wheezl	it's okay bajr i don't have a license either
2014-10-21 22:51:01	@bajr	then my dad got his second divorce and decided "Fuck everything, I'll live by myself on a boat in Juneau"
2014-10-21 22:51:07	@bajr	wheezl: o/
2014-10-21 22:51:17	dom	put yer hand down
2014-10-21 22:51:23	@bajr	dom: put yer face down
2014-10-21 22:51:26	dom	no
2014-10-21 22:51:35	 *	bajr beats dom with the talking stick.
2014-10-21 22:51:48	wheezl	bajr: \o
2014-10-21 22:51:48	 *	dom defends self with super awesome alaskan style
2014-10-21 22:52:39	@bajr	so on a *complete* whim, (and the encouragement of a potentially clinically insane individual named mooper) I dropped some money fixing up my bike, named it Maul-E, packed my shit and started riding
2014-10-21 22:52:44	@bajr	(Mary also helped)
2014-10-21 22:53:07	@bajr	(both of these people are contextless for most of you, so don't worry about that)
2014-10-21 22:53:56	@bajr	It started out as a joke "I could bike there"... then people started joking about bajr getting eaten by bears or mauled by meese
2014-10-21 22:54:01	wheezl	how long did it take you to ride to prince rupert?
2014-10-21 22:54:19	@bajr	wheezl: could have done it in 3 weeks at a semi-leisurely pace
2014-10-21 22:54:26	@bajr	ended up doing it in 6
2014-10-21 22:54:49	@bajr	Google Maps said I could do it in 5 days
2014-10-21 22:55:09	wheezl	dang
2014-10-21 22:55:14	@bajr	sorry, 3 days
2014-10-21 22:55:28	@bajr	GMaps said I could do it in 3 days
2014-10-21 22:55:45	wheezl	how fast would you have to bike jeez
2014-10-21 22:56:02	@bajr	wheezl: Google maps doesn't think I need to sleep or eat
2014-10-21 22:56:12	@bajr	more on those subjects later
2014-10-21 22:56:13	wheezl	or breathe
2014-10-21 22:56:49	@bajr	anyways, after some brief reading and a test-ride with mooper, I concluded I could *totally* do 100-miles per day
2014-10-21 22:57:00	@bajr	which would have finished the tour in a little under 2 weeks
2014-10-21 22:57:32	@bajr	for the record: 100-miles is surprisingly easy to do
2014-10-21 22:57:41	@bajr	... so long as it's just you on the bike
2014-10-21 22:58:32	wheezl	was it not just you on the bike?
2014-10-21 22:58:44	@bajr	and not about 70-80 pounds of very necessary equipment, food, medical supplies, and spare parts
2014-10-21 22:58:54	wheezl	ah right
2014-10-21 22:59:05	@bajr	i suppose I could have packed a lot less
2014-10-21 22:59:31	tombat	who needs a first-aid kit, amirite?
2014-10-21 22:59:39	@bajr	so my dream of 100-miles/day collided with reality pretty hard that first day
2014-10-21 23:00:02	wheezl	that's rough bud
2014-10-21 23:00:22	@bajr	made it about 50-miles by 6pm (Kelso), called up mooper and told him I couldn't do the ride, it would kill me
2014-10-21 23:01:09	@bajr	which prompted him to call me a dumbass and think about that extra stuff I was carrying
2014-10-21 23:01:30	@bajr	and also learn to play it by ear a lot more
2014-10-21 23:02:53	@bajr	so I found a new camp spot that night (ended up doing a total of 80 miles that day, which really isn't that bad) grabbed a shower and collapsed in exhaustion
2014-10-21 23:04:17	@bajr	The next day I was feeling a lot better... Maybe a bit sore (a lot sore) but things were looking up
2014-10-21 23:04:23	@bajr	The hard part was over!
2014-10-21 23:04:28	@bajr	I thought
2014-10-21 23:04:36	wheezl	plot twist??
2014-10-21 23:05:00	@bajr	I had to take a 5 mile detour to find a place to sleep 
2014-10-21 23:05:30	wheezl	OOF
2014-10-21 23:05:31	@bajr	so while I was backtracking that 5-miles, I ended up meeting another bike tourist
2014-10-21 23:06:16	@bajr	His name was Ashley. We talked for a bit, about ourselves and our routes, so he told me I was totally going the wrong direction.
2014-10-21 23:07:26	@bajr	So I figured, "Hey, this guy's got a map. I can totally follow him since it basically goes the exact same direction as my route."
2014-10-21 23:07:53	@bajr	(ftr, I had a map, too, but traveling in groups is better)
2014-10-21 23:08:53	@bajr	well... what I *didn't know about Ashley's map is that it (seemed to) take unusual detours up steep hills
2014-10-21 23:09:43	@bajr	I got a flat tire, but that was easily fixed so I didn't lose much time there.
2014-10-21 23:09:58	@bajr	So we're biking along when we come to the first hill
2014-10-21 23:11:32	@bajr	on Tauscher Rd: https://goo.gl/maps/w9ZxW
2014-10-21 23:11:39	@bajr	which was a very steep hill
2014-10-21 23:11:48	@bajr	I was exhausted when I got to the top
2014-10-21 23:13:16	@bajr	I lag behind a bit, but make it through
2014-10-21 23:13:23	@bajr	well...
2014-10-21 23:13:34	@bajr	not far down the road is hill #2
2014-10-21 23:13:46	@bajr	on basically the same road: https://goo.gl/maps/vnnVu
2014-10-21 23:15:03	@bajr	Not shown in that link are the squirrely streaks of rubber left by the tires of cars that couldn't quite make it up that hill.
2014-10-21 23:15:26	@bajr	I got about 3/4 of the way up before I walked
2014-10-21 23:16:18	@bajr	*Fortunately* it was all downhill after that
2014-10-21 23:16:47	@bajr	Ashley was nice enough to wait for me a little ways up the road, since he didn't have any problems with the Hill of Pain.
2014-10-21 23:18:04	wheezl	probably not if his map is leading him all over yonder and back
2014-10-21 23:18:41	tombat	"you're going the wrong way; why would you go AROUND the mountain, when you can go OVER it?"
2014-10-21 23:18:46	@bajr	So we stopped in Centralia, got a burger, talked about yachts (apparently he's a yacht-builder) and computers. I decided on a camp-site at Millersylvania State Park, which would complete my day at something around 85 miles
2014-10-21 23:19:00	@bajr	tombat: exactly!
2014-10-21 23:19:04	@bajr	except...
2014-10-21 23:20:19	@bajr	it was more like "Let's go *around* this nice flat valley right here, and instead go over the tops of those hills about 10 miles east of your route
2014-10-21 23:20:28	wheezl	why
2014-10-21 23:20:39	@bajr	no clue
2014-10-21 23:20:51	@bajr	it was pretty fun though, he was a cool guy
2014-10-21 23:21:27	@bajr	I did end up riding an extra 10 miles with him because I missed my turn to the park and didn't realize it
2014-10-21 23:22:10	@bajr	so I had to backtrack and ended up getting to the park around sunset (this was in the summer, so sunset was like 9-10pm)
2014-10-21 23:22:48	@bajr	turns out state parks don't really know how to charge bicyclists for camp sites
2014-10-21 23:23:00	@bajr	and the ranger wasn't there (or somehow missed me)
2014-10-21 23:23:08	@bajr	so I got a free campsite!
2014-10-21 23:23:37	@bajr	the downside to this, however, is that since the ranger was absent, I was not able to get a shower...
2014-10-21 23:23:47	@bajr	I was a soggy bajr...
2014-10-21 23:24:28	wheezl	soggy bajr
2014-10-21 23:24:37	wheezl	ew
2014-10-21 23:24:42	@bajr	hehe
2014-10-21 23:24:44	@bajr	anyways, that was day two.
2014-10-21 23:25:36	@bajr	next day I got up really early. Mary had helped me find a place to stay through Couchsurfing.org (which, by the way, is *amazing* for travellers)
2014-10-21 23:26:04	@bajr	so I was scheduled to meet a guy in Kent that night for a place to eat and socializing
2014-10-21 23:27:39	@bajr	It was about this time that my metabolism started going "Wtf is this? You can't spend these many calories and not be hungry."
2014-10-21 23:28:03	@bajr	everything changed when the hunger nation attacked
2014-10-21 23:28:19	@relsqui	lol bajr++
2014-10-21 23:28:21	@bajr	I was prepared, though (kinda)
2014-10-21 23:28:23	wheezl	lol
2014-10-21 23:28:39	@bajr	so I snarfed down some homemade granola with peanut butter and jelly
2014-10-21 23:28:59	 *	relsqui is snarfing a granola bar as we speak
2014-10-21 23:29:23	@bajr	and then I went to a local town (yelm i think?) and got a chai tea and a scone
2014-10-21 23:29:29	wheezl	that sounds tasty
2014-10-21 23:30:38	@bajr	day 3 was surprisingly uneventful. Rode past a very large military base, stopped at a pita pit in Tacoma
2014-10-21 23:30:52	@bajr	Incidentally, one of my two camelbak was stolen
2014-10-21 23:30:56	@bajr	*camelbak's
2014-10-21 23:30:56	@relsqui	:(
2014-10-21 23:31:28	@bajr	which actually wasn't a *terrible* thing, since it meant I was carrying a less weight
2014-10-21 23:31:40	@bajr	(still bad though, because obvious reasons)
2014-10-21 23:32:14	@bajr	also, my bike's front suspension was being super derpy, so I stopped by a bike shop and got an easy fix (hooray for easy fixes)
2014-10-21 23:32:34	wheezl	yay
2014-10-21 23:32:41	sabreman	this is a cool story.
2014-10-21 23:32:59	sabreman	you know, you could totaly write a book about it and sell a ton of copies
2014-10-21 23:34:15	@bajr	heh
2014-10-21 23:34:22	@bajr	nah, not enough of a story to it yet
2014-10-21 23:34:40	wheezl	flesh it out with some existential life journey stuff
2014-10-21 23:34:43	tombat	infoobot: popcorn
2014-10-21 23:34:47	@bajr	anyways, passed through puyallup, got to Kent and gave Mauricio a call
2014-10-21 23:34:59	tombat	guess that doesn't work oustide of robots
2014-10-21 23:35:06	@bajr	wheezl: that part comes later, the loneliness hasn't set in yet
2014-10-21 23:35:09	@relsqui	tombat: it works in channels that have infoobot in them
2014-10-21 23:35:19	@relsqui	tombat: this isn't a cat-private channel, so it has karmabot instead
2014-10-21 23:35:39	@bajr	anyways, I get nervous around strangers as it is
2014-10-21 23:36:32	@bajr	so I'm standing in the strange land of Kent, WA, on my phone; just Maul-E and me, about to meet a random person and sleep in their house
2014-10-21 23:37:03	Pash	and that was the last anyone ever saw of bajr...
2014-10-21 23:37:05	@bajr	Turns out he's walking his dog (cute little chihuahua named Harvey, surprisingly well behaved)
2014-10-21 23:38:16	@bajr	Tells me he's a block away, I see him. Large guy, dressed casually and, most importantly, seems non-threatening
2014-10-21 23:38:52	@bajr	We do the standard introductions, and random chatter on our way to his place.
2014-10-21 23:38:56	wheezl	nice, nice
2014-10-21 23:40:29	@bajr	I get a bit nervous when I notice the entry to his place is up a set of kinda janky stairs leading to a second floor above the back door of a mexican restaurant next to a convenience store whose owner, Mauricio tells me, illegally cut down the trees in front of the store so that people on the street would notice it better.
2014-10-21 23:41:07	@bajr	the options were limited, so I figured, "Meh, ok" and locked up my bike to the stairs, grabbed my stuff and hauled it upstairs

2014-10-22 23:24:18	@relsqui	you count differently depending on what you're counting

2014-10-22 23:33:13	hylleddin	#56 Declare pronouns as if they were variables in a programming language. Example: "John went to the store. Let John be he. He bought some milk."
2014-10-22 23:34:02	@relsqui	I've actually contemplated a conlang (this was for a class) in which you form pronouns on the fly based on the names of people you're talking to
2014-10-22 23:34:12	hylleddin	Interesting.
2014-10-22 23:34:13	@relsqui	like, first consonant cluster + vowel or something?
2014-10-22 23:34:42	@relsqui	I just made that up as an example, but, like, "dom told me that do was going to ..."
2014-10-22 23:34:51	@relsqui	relsqui would go to re
2014-10-22 23:34:52	@relsqui	etc.
2014-10-22 23:35:07	hylleddin	I've seen something similar somewhere, but generalized to noun phrases
2014-10-22 23:35:10	@relsqui	it wouldn't have to be formed that way
2014-10-22 23:35:19	dom	wouldn't work with some names
2014-10-22 23:35:19	@relsqui	but it lets you have as many different pronouns as names, more or less

2014-10-22 23:35:39	@relsqui	yeah, there'd be that kind of conflict, but intonation and context would help
2014-10-22 23:36:09	@relsqui	anyway, it solves the gay porn problem of, like, "she unbuttoned her shirt and then put her hands ..."

2014-10-22 23:41:09	hylleddin	I once had the idea of just having a set of like 5 pronouns, that were used in order.
2014-10-22 23:41:17	@relsqui	!!
2014-10-22 23:41:20	@relsqui	like variables, basically?
2014-10-22 23:41:28	@relsqui	you assign them to people as needed?
2014-10-22 23:41:32	hylleddin	So like, the first entity mentioned would get the first one, the second would get the second one, and so on.
2014-10-22 23:41:44	@relsqui	ASL is actually a little bit like that, except spacially
2014-10-22 23:41:49	@relsqui	if you mention a person you want to refer to again
2014-10-22 23:41:51	@relsqui	you place them, in space, around you
2014-10-22 23:41:55	@relsqui	and then you point to that place later
2014-10-22 23:41:58	@relsqui	but there's an order
2014-10-22 23:42:14	@relsqui	the first person goes on your right (or on the side of your signing hand, rather), next one on the left
2014-10-22 23:42:18	@relsqui	then in the middle I think
2014-10-22 23:42:33	@relsqui	(this is assuming none of them are physically present/in sight, in which case you just point to the person)
2014-10-22 23:42:40	@relsqui	s/spacially/spatially/

2014-10-23 00:07:00	@relsqui	you have to take two other clauses and make a new clause of the same time
2014-10-23 00:07:05	@relsqui	with some kind of coordinating conjunction in between
2014-10-23 00:07:07	@relsqui	shit's complicated, yo
2014-10-23 00:12:13	hylleddin	That prime expression thing is the BEST idea.
2014-10-23 00:12:40	hylleddin	Except you would need a way to generate primes.
2014-10-23 00:12:49	hylleddin	Since there are infinitely many of them.
2014-10-23 00:13:40	@relsqui	well, we don't have infinitely many different words for numbers either

2014-10-24 20:28:02	wheezl	wait are you asking if your message is highlighted everytime you say what now?
2014-10-24 20:28:14	@relsqui	wheezl: it might help to know that Fox and nightfly are both named Sage :)
2014-10-24 20:28:31	@relsqui	so if they highlight on their name then every time I nod sagely I'm pinging them
2014-10-24 20:28:35	@relsqui	which I do not intend to do :P

2014-10-24 20:31:32	nightfly	nope, nadda
2014-10-24 20:31:45	@relsqui	huh. how come?
2014-10-24 20:33:54	nightfly	Less things that immediately try and grab my attention that way. I read scrollback in relevant channels and if it's important enough it will either come up again or I will get paged for it.
2014-10-24 20:35:00	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-24 20:35:33	@relsqui	I think the set of things I want to be aware of is greater than the set of things people would go out of their way to alert me about, heh
2014-10-24 20:35:37	 *	relsqui is not a team lead though :)
2014-10-24 20:35:40	@relsqui	have the zombies met the leads?
2014-10-24 20:36:44	nightfly	I don't think formally yet, other than at orientation
2014-10-24 20:37:13	@relsqui	might be nice for a bd or dog meeting
2014-10-24 20:38:23	@relsqui	oh, which reminds me
2014-10-24 20:38:23	nightfly	gah, I don't think I've ever had to deal with this much new hardware at one time before
2014-10-24 20:38:37	@relsqui	nightfly: zombies welcome at your meetings?
2014-10-24 20:38:49	@relsqui	or, d'you have a policy about that
2014-10-24 20:38:51	@relsqui	more generally
2014-10-24 20:41:24	nightfly	In general, yes. During the transition it's probably gonna be up to janaka's discretion more than mine though. But formally *nix is in Texas right now to accommodate more people.
2014-10-24 20:41:50	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-24 21:07:54	wheezl	i have a friend who is sitting in the back and apparently the guy next to him is hardcore asleep
2014-10-24 21:10:21	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-24 21:11:36	wheezl	the perils of sitting in the back
2014-10-24 21:11:55	@relsqui	yeah, noticed you got a good spot
2014-10-24 21:12:50	wheezl	i try to avoid sitting in the back for that very reason
2014-10-24 21:13:45	wheezl	also these dang glass whiteboards hurt my eyes and it's easier to sit in the front
2014-10-24 21:14:08	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-24 21:14:10	@relsqui	I'm not into that one either
2014-10-24 21:15:17	wheezl	i would like to meet whoever thought those whiteboards was a good idea
2014-10-24 21:15:24	wheezl	i mean it looks pretty, don't get me wrong
2014-10-24 21:15:29	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-24 21:15:33	@relsqui	but so hard to read
2014-10-24 21:15:34	wheezl	until you actually have to use them

2014-10-25 18:44:31	nebrith	He asked for 1. I told him I'd happily throw in 5 if he admitted how often girls liked that accent
2014-10-25 18:45:04	nebrith	He just grinned, tipped his flatcap, and said "A gentleman never tells." and then we harrumphed and Britished at one another until he got on the MAX and continued panhandling exclusively to cute girls.
2014-10-25 18:45:16	dom	kek
2014-10-25 18:45:26	tamgc	heh
2014-10-25 18:45:52	nebrith	So I take it as the compliment it is and feel bad that his accent is actually worse than Dick Van Dyke's.
2014-10-25 18:49:37	tamgc	not sure if that's a good or bad thing, cause Dick Van Dyke's awesome (bad accent and all =P)
2014-10-25 18:50:54	tamgc	but hey, he's got a schtick, and it's working/harmless, so good for him heh
2014-10-25 20:37:12	nebrith	tamgc: Yeah I was pretty impressed

2014-10-26 00:32:19	taron	good question
2014-10-26 00:32:27	taron	i'm debating whether to actually fix it or just accept the chaos
2014-10-26 00:32:33	dom	accept it
2014-10-26 00:32:43	dom	you could use nested screen sessions

2014-10-26 00:35:02	taron	or I could just kick coldfront to the back of the line again so I at least know where the channels end and the pms start
2014-10-26 00:35:15	taron	actually I should play with the settings a bit more and see what all I can view in the status bar
2014-10-26 00:35:32	tamgc	make a script to randomly move your windows around
2014-10-26 00:35:40	@relsqui	Epitrope: I run cat-irc and non-cat irc in different clients, on different servers
2014-10-26 00:36:45	taron	i don't use enough other servers to warrant that sort of thing
2014-10-26 00:36:49	Epitrope	sounds complicated
2014-10-26 00:36:55	@relsqui	so normally I'm sshed to reaver, with shells holding cat-irssi, a session to rita, and a session to carabiner; that last also has a screen session with irssi and whatever else
2014-10-26 00:36:58	@relsqui	it's not that bad

2014-10-26 00:38:37	taron	also, love how we went from discussing tabletop things in #zombies to discussing non tabletop things in #tabletop

2014-10-26 13:09:39	dom	well, java is remarkably similar to C family
2014-10-26 13:09:45	dom	and ^
2014-10-26 13:09:48	dom	what tam said
2014-10-26 13:09:59	dom	logical process
2014-10-26 13:19:08	stormcrow	bajr: C# is pretty much Microsoft's Java-like language. I think they made it after Sun hit them with a lawsuit for licensing violations back in the '90s
2014-10-26 13:26:48	@bajr	heh
2014-10-26 13:55:25	@bajr	well that's annoying... Visual Studio won't try to compile anything unless it's part of a project.
2014-10-26 14:10:22	nebrith	bajr: that sounds very annoying
2014-10-26 14:46:51	mancat	karmabot: bajr is uses broken IDE, complains when it doesn't work
2014-10-26 14:46:51	karmabot	Yes, mancat.
2014-10-26 14:47:38	@bajr	hmm, i wouldn't say it's broken quite yet, besides that, it seems to work pretty well
2014-10-26 14:48:08	mancat	and yet it doesn't do what you want it to :D
2014-10-26 14:48:49	@bajr	if things simply did what we wanted to, we'd never get compiling errors
2014-10-26 14:50:20	mancat	nat really true
2014-10-26 14:50:36	mancat	if they never did what we want them to, we'd never get compiling errors
2014-10-26 14:50:37	taron	segfault ALL the things
2014-10-26 14:50:45	mancat	because i want wy compiler to compile things
2014-10-26 14:52:02	@bajr	fair enough, but the point still stands; just because it's a different workflow to what I'm used to doesn't mean the IDE is broken
2014-10-26 15:21:29	taron	herp derp apparently i got ali aras confused with arik alabel last night
2014-10-26 15:21:33	taron	only slightly embarrassing
2014-10-26 15:27:21	@relsqui	14:48:49 <@bajr> if things simply did what we wanted to, we'd never get compiling errors
2014-10-26 15:27:26	@relsqui	your problem is you're not writing python
2014-10-26 15:27:28	@relsqui	> import dwim
2014-10-26 15:27:29	@relsqui	;)
2014-10-26 15:28:32	taron	probably one of my favorite things about python, when debugging django projects you just refresh until it stops complaining
2014-10-26 15:28:44	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-10-26 15:29:18	taron	i mean, there's some coding in there, but let's be honest, it's mostly refreshing and crossing your fingers
2014-10-26 15:29:28	@relsqui	(refreshing and crossing your fingers)++

2014-10-26 16:16:48	dom	they don't seem particularly exclusive, except that piercings are way more common in goth culture and outright dangerous in gym nut culture
2014-10-26 16:17:26	taron	well, she's got 17 in various places and still hasn't managed to seriously injure herself yet

2014-10-26 16:29:27	@dom	I did it
2014-10-26 16:29:44	taron	yeah it's mostly just the ones like this that I was curious about, was sort of avoiding them earlier since I don't really know many people around here
2014-10-26 16:29:51	taron	also gz :D
2014-10-26 16:38:36	@dom	well, you can /whois people to find channels you might like
2014-10-26 16:39:43	taron	i've become slightly paranoid about /whois after someone pm'd me because I did so on a previous server, didn't know enough to know whether he could actually know I did that
2014-10-26 16:40:48	@dom	I don't think it shows up on this server
2014-10-26 16:41:12	@dom	either that or no one has ever whois'd me, which is a possibility
2014-10-26 16:41:32	taron	lol been wondering the same
2014-10-26 16:41:32	Epitrope	if you've ever completed a snot ticket with underscore, you've been whois'd
2014-10-26 16:42:54	@bajr	yeah I don't think it tells people on this server if you /whois them
2014-10-26 16:43:07	taron	paranoia decreased slightly then
2014-10-26 16:44:05	@bajr	kinda curious why /whois would be improper etiquette?
2014-10-26 16:44:48	taron	probably becasue it was 711chan irc and they also ran the partyvan wiki and all that, were always members getting arrested periodically
2014-10-26 16:45:10	Epitrope	there is an extension to enable giving a notice for whois queries; on our ircd it is compiled to be operators-only
2014-10-26 16:45:15	Epitrope	https://github.com/atheme/charybdis/blob/c1ca217a03c63d3af27cfc2b7b7a16c85af8de01/extensions/sno_whois.c

2014-10-26 16:47:05	Epitrope	also it's not linked in; I can't set +W on myself: Unknown MODE flag
2014-10-26 16:47:11	Epitrope	taron: so /whois away
2014-10-26 16:47:28	taron	good to know.
2014-10-26 17:00:47	Epitrope	clarification: it is linked in, is hidden behind an opers-only flag, and only works intra-server. so, if you're connected to firefly and /whois Opertrope, I'll see that, but if you're connected to iss or if you /whois Epitrope I will not see that
2014-10-26 17:05:40	taron	huh. think i'll read up on the protocol in general later.
2014-10-26 17:06:51	Epitrope	(to be clear, there are only a handful of opers on the cat irc network, and we're all listed in the /motd)
2014-10-26 17:09:40	taron	don't know nearly enough about IRC yet to know what opers do in the first place versus a regular user (besides having elevated privileges of some sort of course)
2014-10-26 17:11:28	Epitrope	that's about 90% of it <_< >_>
2014-10-26 17:12:35	taron	lol
2014-10-26 17:14:01	Epitrope	the other 10% is dealing with user requests ("can has ops in this channel", "can has this nickname protected by nickserv") and making sure the irc works (restarts, upgrades, security patches, etc)
2014-10-26 17:14:44	@relsqui	Epitrope: I don't think we have the permits to comp a ticket with undersore
2014-10-26 17:15:39	Epitrope	relsqui: ents certainly should, by now; if you try and can't you should ping Wren
2014-10-26 17:15:56	@relsqui	huh, okay
2014-10-26 17:18:05	@relsqui	not sure how often I want to silently comp a ticket anyway

2014-10-26 22:20:28	askore	I actually don't like eggnog much?
2014-10-26 22:20:29	taron	i regard most forms of food as an inconvenient necessity for staying alive, used to drink but citalopram + alcohol = bad
2014-10-26 22:20:41	askore	but mostly because I don't drink alcohol and eggnog - alcohol = some weird milk shit
2014-10-26 22:20:54	@relsqui	nah it's good
2014-10-26 22:21:00	@relsqui	I do drink alcohol but I drink nonalcoholic egg nog

2014-10-26 22:21:58	Pash	but it's sooooooo goooooooood, like when you pick up the mug of egg nog in both hands and take a big drink and then you have egg nog in your moustache and you're like "I'm saving this for later."
2014-10-26 22:22:06	taron	hahaha
2014-10-26 22:22:10	@relsqui	believe it or not that is not an experience I have had

2014-10-26 22:47:22	taron	i'm finding just keeping this up rather than having something intensive as a side task is actually helping keep my morale up
2014-10-26 22:47:36	taron	either that or i'm making excuses for being the king of procrastination again

2014-10-26 22:51:00	taron	us intl keyboard ftw, probably doesn't work so well for hebrew though

2014-10-26 22:52:51	@relsqui	how ... how did that go
2014-10-26 22:53:12	taron	i couldn't read any of it and asked her about it the next day, she remembered nothing lol
2014-10-26 22:53:17	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-26 22:53:28	taron	and she has not gone out for mai tai mittwoch since

2014-10-26 22:55:05	@relsqui	(I'm not even typing my homework in hebrew, I'm just looking stuff up occasionally)
2014-10-26 22:55:40	@relsqui	when I can't remember a word, or, more often, it's transliterating something it hopes is famous enough I've heard about it (and thus can write sentences about it), and I haven't, so I have to get google translate to put it back in english for me so I can look up what it is ^_^:
2014-10-26 22:55:44	@relsqui	^_^;
2014-10-26 22:56:40	taron	too bad dict.cc doesn't have a good hebrew section
2014-10-26 22:56:47	taron	or any hebrew section for that matter
2014-10-26 22:57:11	taron	relied heavily on it for german
2014-10-26 22:57:15	@relsqui	huh, interesting
2014-10-26 22:57:24	@relsqui	gtranslate is doing well enough for single words, though
2014-10-26 22:57:28	@relsqui	especially now that it has vowel points O_O
2014-10-26 22:57:34	@relsqui	I don't know where it's getting those but it makes it a million times more useful
2014-10-26 22:57:42	taron	yeah that's all i use it for
2014-10-26 22:59:21	taron	...okay, that and I did use it to find russian insults once.
2014-10-26 23:02:44	@relsqui	lolol
2014-10-26 23:03:08	@relsqui	there's a song (in hebrew) by a band called dag nachash, called "rak po" -- "only here"
2014-10-26 23:03:16	@relsqui	kind of "you know you're from israel when" stuff
2014-10-26 23:03:27	@relsqui	and one of them is "only here, do we speak hebrew but swear in russian, arabic, and english"

2014-10-26 23:44:34	taron	lol pretty much my opinion.
2014-10-26 23:44:55	taron	getting to the good part though, basically get to insult george orwell which is not something i'd do often
2014-10-26 23:45:43	Pash	papers aren't supposed to be fun, they're supposed to give you an increasing sense of existential emptiness as you realize that the skill of essay writing is unlikely to ever be useful after you graduate

2014-10-26 23:55:49	taron	heh, nah, was at the u of o
2014-10-26 23:55:50	@dom	the trick is to make your bullshit have meaning
2014-10-26 23:56:01	Pash	taron: high school trained me out of that
2014-10-26 23:56:06	@dom	like a few kernels of corn truth in an otherwise steaming pile of bullshit
2014-10-26 23:57:04	taron	high school did not succeed in its attempts to beat it out of me. advantage or disadvantage of being extremely stubborn depending on how you look at it.
2014-10-26 23:58:18	@dom	I think its not really bullshitting you're supposed to learn in high school, but how to beat around the bush
2014-10-26 23:58:47	@dom	writing a 10 page paper on RFID technology is a waste of time compared to a simple verbal conversation, but someone has to do it
2014-10-26 23:59:03	@dom	(as an aside, I loved writing that paper but only cuz RFID technology is super fucking cool)

2014-10-27 00:00:21	@relsqui	I clearly cannot be trusted with unstructured time
2014-10-27 00:00:31	@dom	you know, they sell sets of RFID recievers and "signal-makers" to big companies for pennies on the dollar

2014-10-27 01:02:24	@relsqui	dom++ lolol
2014-10-27 01:02:49	@relsqui	okay can I vent for a sec
2014-10-27 01:02:55	@relsqui	about something totally unrelated to any of you
2014-10-27 01:03:42	taron	...I was going to defer to someone who's been here for longer, but since people are being slow, fire away.
2014-10-27 01:03:47	@dom	when has the answer ever been no
2014-10-27 01:04:00	@relsqui	I DO NOT GET CONFERENCE TWEETS
2014-10-27 01:04:10	@relsqui	if I wanted a constant stream of things going on at the con I WOULD BE AT THE CON
2014-10-27 01:04:25	@relsqui	and I'm not going to unfollow you because the rest of the year I want to hear what you have to say about, like, your actual life that I can relate to
2014-10-27 01:04:46	@relsqui	140-character snippets from talks, even if they're interesting if you were there, aren't useful or interesting
2014-10-27 01:05:15	@dom	I can't sympathize :P I stay away from all of twitter for that reason
2014-10-27 01:05:21	taron	I know that feel
2014-10-27 01:05:34	@relsqui	dom: I am strongly considering it
2014-10-27 01:05:54	taron	everyone I follow is either obsessed with startups, or tweets about eve meetups I can't go to
2014-10-27 01:06:31	@dom	I like some startups
2014-10-27 01:06:38	@relsqui	yeah I mean mostly I manage it by not following boring people but sometimes people I like post boring things and I don't know what to do
2014-10-27 01:06:45	@dom	but a lot of them ride the wave of hype after the ingenuity and then never get anywhere
2014-10-27 01:07:21	Pash	welp

2014-10-27 01:07:41	@relsqui	'night
2014-10-27 01:07:43	taron	it's not even the startups themselves, it's the way the people behind them act. I didn't move out of the richest suburb of columbus so I could deal with people who are other varieties of plastic.

2014-10-27 01:08:23	@relsqui	taron: tl;dr fuck capitalism? :)
2014-10-27 01:08:42	taron	relsqui: works for me.
2014-10-27 01:09:28	taron	though now I can't help but think of another group I knew at osu
2014-10-27 01:10:23	@relsqui	mm?
2014-10-27 01:10:46	@dom	spill
2014-10-27 01:10:47	@dom	spill
2014-10-27 01:10:57	taron	founded a coed fraternity which was specifically targeted at being welcoming to genderqueer people. one of the people hated everyone in the group except me because apparently being half chinese is enough for him to consider me a queer person of color
2014-10-27 01:11:19	taron	strangest brand of liberalism i've ever encountered
2014-10-27 01:12:10	@relsqui	... lol
2014-10-27 01:12:14	@relsqui	that is, indeed, odd
2014-10-27 01:12:41	taron	that and the fact that I could fix his computer >_>
2014-10-27 01:12:44	@relsqui	hahaha
2014-10-27 01:12:50	@relsqui	so you were basically perfect
2014-10-27 01:12:52	@dom	he probs thought they were related
2014-10-27 01:13:05	taron	p much
2014-10-27 01:14:19	@relsqui	> Q: If I have a Courser of Kruphix and cast See the Unwritten, does that mean I get to see my ninth car --
2014-10-27 01:14:25	@relsqui	no, and no to every similar question

2014-10-27 01:14:32	@relsqui	these keep coming up on cranial insertion right now, lol
2014-10-27 01:14:38	@relsqui	because courser, I guess
2014-10-27 01:15:10	@relsqui	haha, this is a good one:
2014-10-27 01:15:10	@relsqui	Q: If I cast Aura Mutation targeting my Karametra, God of Harvests, do I get Saproling tokens? Or does she actually have to be destroyed for that to happen?
2014-10-27 01:16:06	taron	never heard of cranial insertion before. suddenly feel like I live under a rock.
2014-10-27 01:16:19	@relsqui	sorry, I just wildly changed topics
2014-10-27 01:16:31	taron	lol it's all good i figured it out pretty quick
2014-10-27 01:16:44	@relsqui	magic the gathering rules site thingie
2014-10-27 01:16:50	@relsqui	they do a weekly(?) Q&A article
2014-10-27 01:16:54	taron	just confused cause that was the other thing we'd do on saturday nights is play drunken edh
2014-10-27 01:16:55	@dom	we got a megazord going, see
2014-10-27 01:16:59	@relsqui	oho
2014-10-27 01:17:00	@dom	mancat knows the janky old combos
2014-10-27 01:17:04	@dom	I play magic
2014-10-27 01:17:07	@dom	relsqui knows the rules
2014-10-27 01:17:11	@dom	by our powers combined
2014-10-27 01:17:14	@dom	we dont play magic
2014-10-27 01:17:16	@dom	kek
2014-10-27 01:17:17	@relsqui	lmao
2014-10-27 01:17:19	taron	lol
2014-10-27 01:17:22	@relsqui	that's, uh
2014-10-27 01:17:23	@relsqui	embarrassingly true
2014-10-27 01:17:27	@relsqui	however! #mtg is a thing
2014-10-27 01:17:39	@relsqui	and so is pdxmtg.com for all your we-have-an-actual-magic-club-on-campus needs
2014-10-27 01:17:51	@relsqui	and by "we" I mean it's run by some combination of me/dom/mancat/pash
2014-10-27 01:17:59	taron	i'm fantastically terrible at it, and still getting over frustration from that set of roommates. might pick it up later though.
2014-10-27 01:18:05	@relsqui	that's fair
2014-10-27 01:18:12	@relsqui	fwiw I've only been playing since like february
2014-10-27 01:18:18	@relsqui	I'm just a giant rules nerd
2014-10-27 01:18:18	taron	same set i played dnd with
2014-10-27 01:18:33	taron	makes sense
2014-10-27 01:18:39	@relsqui	take your time, but our group is a pretty soft place to land
2014-10-27 01:18:39	@relsqui	on purpose
2014-10-27 01:19:14	taron	yeah i just have to get over the instinctive fist clenching whenever i hear about mtg cause I think of those assholes >_>
2014-10-27 01:19:28	@dom	do you
2014-10-27 01:19:29	@relsqui	I have heard that called an "allergy," in a mental/social sense
2014-10-27 01:19:31	@dom	do you want me to beat them up
2014-10-27 01:19:45	@relsqui	like, "it's not that I actually have a problem with the thing, I'm just allergic to it so I flinch when I hear about it"
2014-10-27 01:20:16	taron	dom: they're not worth the $600 plane ticket, and you'd end up getting shot anyway given that they own guns and one of them is a marine.
2014-10-27 01:20:31	taron	also that is the best analogy I have heard for that. thank you.
2014-10-27 01:20:35	taron	am using that from now on.
2014-10-27 01:20:39	@relsqui	:)
2014-10-27 01:20:43	@dom	kek
2014-10-27 01:20:43	@relsqui	*yes*
2014-10-27 01:20:45	@relsqui	I got a tricksy one right
2014-10-27 01:20:47	@relsqui	I'm getting better at this
2014-10-27 01:20:51	 *	relsqui -> #mtg tho
2014-10-27 01:21:03	taron	sums up my opinions of ohio really

2014-10-27 01:21:15	@relsqui	I felt like that about Portland for a long time

2014-10-27 01:21:23	 *	relsqui grins
2014-10-27 01:21:27	taron	if I can spell join properly
2014-10-27 01:21:30	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-27 01:21:34	@relsqui	typing is hard
2014-10-27 01:21:54	 *	taron /jions all the things
2014-10-27 01:25:11	taron	portland was always an escape from ohio for me every time i passed through, so the honeymoon period when i first moved got me through not knowing anyone
2014-10-27 01:25:25	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-27 01:25:44	 *	dom spent a year in portland not at the cat
2014-10-27 01:25:49	@dom	that was a wasted year
2014-10-27 01:25:52	@relsqui	heh
2014-10-27 01:26:04	@relsqui	I spent a year in portland not at the cat and it was, well, hellish
2014-10-27 01:26:11	@relsqui	for reasons unrelated to PSU or anything
2014-10-27 01:26:18	@relsqui	(except v. indirectly)
2014-10-27 01:27:03	@dom	that was the year mists of pandaria came out
2014-10-27 01:27:06	@dom	Im liking it less and less
2014-10-27 01:27:11	@relsqui	rofl
2014-10-27 01:27:15	@dom	the year, I already hate MoP
2014-10-27 01:27:47	taron	probably lucky someone had mentioned it to me a year ago or I would've just glossed over the poster by the elevators
2014-10-27 01:28:03	@relsqui	same, actually
2014-10-27 01:28:11	@relsqui	I sorta glossed over this in my orientation talk
2014-10-27 01:28:15	taron	granted bret mentioned irc so i would've found my way here as well
2014-10-27 01:28:25	@relsqui	but the conversation in which Epitrope told me "you should join the cat" and me actually joining the cat were a year apart
2014-10-27 01:28:26	taron	relsqui: I remember literally none of it anyway >_>
2014-10-27 01:28:29	@dom	I saw it in my first freshman class and thought "fuck that, I got shit to do"
2014-10-27 01:28:38	@relsqui	taron: no worries, I didn't retain any of ours *g*
2014-10-27 01:28:39	@dom	saw it sophomore year and thought "whats to lose"
2014-10-27 01:28:43	 *	relsqui does not take that at all personally
2014-10-27 01:28:45	@relsqui	heh, yeah
2014-10-27 01:28:55	@relsqui	my initial response was "I do not have time for anything that doesn't pay me," which was true
2014-10-27 01:28:58	@relsqui	at the time
2014-10-27 01:29:13	@dom	I remember a lot of relsqui's orientation talk, mostly cuz it had a lot of our #deepshit talks in it
2014-10-27 01:29:33	@dom	also the machete
2014-10-27 01:29:36	@dom	metaphor
2014-10-27 01:29:38	@dom	was great
2014-10-27 01:29:44	taron	oddly enough, I have my password sheet in front of me currently, except it's currently covered in package names
2014-10-27 01:29:50	taron	seconded

2014-10-27 01:31:56	@relsqui	words which mean too many things: "braindump" "orientation"
2014-10-27 01:31:57	@dom	taron: hey wanna assist at mcecs orientation in december?
2014-10-27 01:32:01	@relsqui	^^^

2014-10-27 01:32:23	@relsqui	ways*
2014-10-27 01:32:26	taron	dom: I'm willing to give it a shot if I can get my anxiety settled enough by then.
2014-10-27 01:32:31	@relsqui	legit.
2014-10-27 01:32:35	@dom	^ because of orientation, I was up 40 hours last term

2014-10-27 01:52:17	@dom	OK im going to "bed"
2014-10-27 01:52:25	@dom	ill probably play tome for a couple hours
2014-10-27 01:52:30	@relsqui	:P
2014-10-27 01:52:32	@dom	and im definitely logging back into irc
2014-10-27 01:52:36	@relsqui	k
2014-10-27 01:52:38	@relsqui	well
2014-10-27 01:52:41	@dom	but moving a yard to the left is the principle of the thing
2014-10-27 01:52:43	@relsqui	in case I'm not still here, g'niht
2014-10-27 01:52:45	@relsqui	lol
2014-10-27 01:52:46	@dom	cya
2014-10-27 01:56:16	 *	dom is back in irc
2014-10-27 01:56:24	@dom	what a long, strange trip its been
2014-10-27 01:57:08	@relsqui	<_<
2014-10-27 01:57:51	@relsqui	dom: did I show you color version of pdxmtg logo?
2014-10-27 01:57:59	@relsqui	or proposal of same
2014-10-27 01:58:11	@dom	you showed my blk n white version
2014-10-27 01:58:12	@dom	spill
2014-10-27 01:58:20	@relsqui	wat email
2014-10-27 01:58:36	@dom	tmason@pdx
2014-10-27 02:01:14	@dom	I rlly like the first 2
2014-10-27 02:01:30	@dom	but I don't like the colored one cuz the white gives too much white space
2014-10-27 02:01:47	@dom	if that was on dark green, I'd like it a lot
2014-10-27 02:01:52	@relsqui	I agree, I was thinking about maybe asking her to pull the lettering in closer--let the horns block out the top part, that's fine <_<
2014-10-27 02:02:29	@relsqui	and then maybe colored spots around the side and overlapping it? just speculating
2014-10-27 02:02:36	@dom	maybe
2014-10-27 02:02:40	@dom	I agree though
2014-10-27 02:02:42	@relsqui	I agree with her that that's the best overall word placement though
2014-10-27 02:02:45	@dom	yeah
2014-10-27 02:03:09	@dom	I keep wanting to push dark green and dark gray
2014-10-27 02:03:24	@dom	like letters in dark gray or silver as the top layer
2014-10-27 02:03:31	@dom	with chromanticore on the bottom layer
2014-10-27 02:03:36	@dom	but the words overlap his horns
2014-10-27 02:03:39	@dom	their horns
2014-10-27 02:03:42	@dom	whateer
2014-10-27 02:03:55	@dom	and then dark green for the black empty space
2014-10-27 02:04:13	@dom	keeping the chromanticore as a negative space outline looks super good though
2014-10-27 02:04:24	@dom	(as opposed to it being a positive space surrounded by negative space)
2014-10-27 02:04:30	@dom	idk if my jargon is correct
2014-10-27 02:04:39	@dom	I just don't like all the empty uncolored white space
2014-10-27 02:04:51	@dom	a different color would look better I feel
2014-10-27 02:05:53	@dom	does any of that make sense?
2014-10-27 02:05:54	@dom	>>
2014-10-27 02:06:01	@relsqui	yeah; sorry, was afk readying for bed
2014-10-27 02:06:08	@relsqui	I agree with you re positive/negative space
2014-10-27 02:06:22	@relsqui	kinda picturing something like the second one but more embossed-looking?
2014-10-27 02:06:29	@dom	yeah
2014-10-27 02:06:32	@dom	well
2014-10-27 02:06:39	@dom	the second one in colors
2014-10-27 02:06:41	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-27 02:06:49	@dom	and then the words moved into the inner edge of the rim
2014-10-27 02:06:57	@relsqui	mm! yeah.
2014-10-27 02:06:58	@dom	so its like a coin
2014-10-27 02:07:46	@dom	I think the large 'MAGIC' might conflict with the mana symbols
2014-10-27 02:08:01	@dom	but if its the top layer with those behind it it might still look good
2014-10-27 02:08:12	@relsqui	what do you think about sliding the dots to the side?
2014-10-27 02:08:26	@dom	not even, so you'd have weirdness
2014-10-27 02:08:30	@dom	you mean all to one side?
2014-10-27 02:08:49	@relsqui	yeah, rotating them around, like where they're positioned in the second set
2014-10-27 02:08:58	@dom	I dunno
2014-10-27 02:09:01	@dom	I like the centered head
2014-10-27 02:09:05	@dom	its the best part
2014-10-27 02:09:18	@relsqui	could keep that, and just have the dots on one side and some space on the other
2014-10-27 02:09:26	@relsqui	if the dots were smaller
2014-10-27 02:09:28	@relsqui	or just drop the dots :P
2014-10-27 02:09:38	@dom	I like the dots where they are
2014-10-27 02:09:51	@dom	I think the best way to do it is the second image with the words overlayed on top of it
2014-10-27 02:10:16	@dom	maybe have the mana symbols be overlapping with the MAGIC
2014-10-27 02:10:26	@dom	like M is white A is blue etc
2014-10-27 02:10:34	@dom	or like they have an 'aura'
2014-10-27 02:10:39	@dom	of that color
2014-10-27 02:10:40	@relsqui	I mean at that point we could just color the letters and not dots
2014-10-27 02:10:40	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-27 02:10:57	@dom	I don't want the letters to be colored differently
2014-10-27 02:11:02	@dom	that takes away from it
2014-10-27 02:11:04	@dom	I think
2014-10-27 02:11:19	@dom	but colored auras for the letters might look snazzy
2014-10-27 02:11:29	@dom	or even just have the dots centered behind the letters
2014-10-27 02:11:29	@relsqui	oh, yeah
2014-10-27 02:11:35	@relsqui	I'm afraid that'd be too busy
2014-10-27 02:11:36	@relsqui	hard to read
2014-10-27 02:11:42	@relsqui	especially on, like, a stamp, or a grayscale flyer
2014-10-27 02:11:42	@dom	yeah, maybe
2014-10-27 02:11:45	@dom	sure
2014-10-27 02:12:41	@dom	mmmm now that I look at it
2014-10-27 02:12:49	@dom	keeping the words at the edge draws your attention
2014-10-27 02:12:57	@dom	I think they work
2014-10-27 02:13:11	@dom	I don't really like the margin, but it might look weird without it
2014-10-27 02:13:31	@dom	keeping the words as breaking up the rim also makes it easy to read
2014-10-27 02:13:41	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-27 02:13:52	@relsqui	might be able to combine those ideas; pull them in a little closer but still have them at the edge
2014-10-27 02:14:01	@relsqui	and keep the chromanticore in negative space
2014-10-27 02:14:15	@relsqui	I think "coin" is a useful idea though
2014-10-27 02:15:01	@dom	I think keeping the 'MAGIC' not curved is a big deal thouh
2014-10-27 02:15:14	@dom	it looks really powerful on that straight line
2014-10-27 02:15:19	@dom	idk how to say it
2014-10-27 02:15:39	@relsqui	oh, interesting
2014-10-27 02:15:40	@dom	I mean, we can have this on a coin as well
2014-10-27 02:15:40	@relsqui	I hadn't even noticed
2014-10-27 02:15:53	@relsqui	yeah, I don't mean literally coin-looking, just as an idea
2014-10-27 02:15:54	@relsqui	for shading etc.
2014-10-27 02:16:00	@dom	yeah
2014-10-27 02:16:10	@dom	the more I look at it, the more I like the second image with colors
2014-10-27 02:16:10	@relsqui	rather than having it look like an actual chromanticore head
2014-10-27 02:17:01	@dom	I really like the chromanticore head as negative space
2014-10-27 02:17:13	@relsqui	yes
2014-10-27 02:17:17	@dom	the black does need to be replaced with a lighter color though
2014-10-27 02:17:20	@dom	not that much lighter
2014-10-27 02:17:23	@dom	but not black
2014-10-27 02:17:31	@relsqui	I still really like the idea of gold
2014-10-27 02:17:34	@relsqui	'cause multicolor, you know?
2014-10-27 02:17:48	@dom	what about a gold chromanticore head outline?
2014-10-27 02:17:59	@dom	like the outer edge of the head
2014-10-27 02:18:07	@relsqui	or, gold on a darker color
2014-10-27 02:18:09	@relsqui	so it's still negative
2014-10-27 02:18:16	@dom	I don't like solid gold lines
2014-10-27 02:18:21	@dom	I think they look tacky
2014-10-27 02:18:29	@relsqui	doesn't have to be solid
2014-10-27 02:18:39	@dom	yeah, gold trim would look really good
2014-10-27 02:18:41	@dom	I think
2014-10-27 02:18:55	@relsqui	that sounds like it's getting to be a lot of detail for a logo though
2014-10-27 02:19:05	@dom	I mean, not that much
2014-10-27 02:19:05	 *	relsqui looks again
2014-10-27 02:19:13	@relsqui	oh, maybe the whitespace around the outside of the dark part
2014-10-27 02:19:16	@relsqui	so it's gold-bordered
2014-10-27 02:19:19	@dom	yeah
2014-10-27 02:19:21	@dom	thats what I meant
2014-10-27 02:19:23	@relsqui	got it
2014-10-27 02:19:24	@relsqui	yeah
2014-10-27 02:19:29	@relsqui	I didn't have it in front of me when I said that
2014-10-27 02:19:33	@dom	wait
2014-10-27 02:19:42	@dom	the whole thing be gold bordered>
2014-10-27 02:19:43	@dom	or the head
2014-10-27 02:19:49	@dom	I think just the head would look best
2014-10-27 02:20:01	@dom	I was meaning the head to be gold bordered
2014-10-27 02:20:33	@relsqui	okay, I think I'm hitting my limit for speculating in the abstract
2014-10-27 02:20:33	@relsqui	heh
2014-10-27 02:20:41	@relsqui	can definitely condense that into some notes
2014-10-27 02:20:44	@dom	yeah
2014-10-27 02:20:47	@relsqui	to pass back
2014-10-27 02:20:52	@dom	also might play with both be gold bordered
2014-10-27 02:21:02	@dom	so the inner dark areas are enclosed
2014-10-27 02:21:07	@dom	that might look good 
2014-10-27 02:21:10	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-27 02:21:15	@dom	add those to notes :)
2014-10-27 02:21:40	 *	relsqui not writing them down right now, will email amy back tomorrow
2014-10-27 02:22:06	@relsqui	amy++
2014-10-27 02:22:20	@dom	amy++
2014-10-27 02:22:26	@dom	it looks really solid already though
2014-10-27 02:23:20	@relsqui	for sure
2014-10-27 02:23:27	@relsqui	I dig her rendition of the character
2014-10-27 02:24:28	@dom	yah
2014-10-27 02:24:54	@dom	the gradient actually looks really snazzy but I dont think its right on a logo
2014-10-27 02:24:58	@dom	which is a shame
2014-10-27 02:27:54	@relsqui	totally agree on both counts

2014-10-29 00:10:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	ah >_>
2014-10-29 00:10:35	VanHelsing	unions are such hax
2014-10-29 00:10:44	@RelsquiescatInPace	trufax
2014-10-29 00:10:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	truhax
2014-10-29 00:10:48	@bajr	also, grudgingly, permitting old code to keep it's goto statements
2014-10-29 00:10:51	@bajr	*its
2014-10-29 00:11:01	@bajr	yeah, unions seem pretty magical
2014-10-29 00:11:18	@RelsquiescatInPace	I've heard mancat explain what they are
2014-10-29 00:11:22	mancaterwaul	nothing wrong with gotos :D
2014-10-29 00:11:25	@RelsquiescatInPace	but I still dunno why you want one/what problem they solve
2014-10-29 00:11:40	@dom	gotos are like the magic fixits for every coding problem
2014-10-29 00:11:54	terroron	i don't know if i'd call that fixing
2014-10-29 00:11:56	mancaterwaul	RelsquiescatInPace: useful for things where you're treating a number both as binary and decimal without having to do conversions
2014-10-29 00:12:00	mancaterwaul	that's the big one i know of, at any rate
2014-10-29 00:12:07	@RelsquiescatInPace	come again?
2014-10-29 00:12:52	mancaterwaul	for example you can expess a file permission as a union of a 3-bit int, and three binary flags
2014-10-29 00:13:13	@bajr	if i learned it correctly... it lets you reference the same memory location with different typecasts
2014-10-29 00:13:15	mancaterwaul	so you can read, for example, 5, or just check the second field and find that read is disabled
2014-10-29 00:13:21	mancaterwaul	yeah, pretty much
2014-10-29 00:13:32	@RelsquiescatInPace	mancaterwaul: what stops you from doing that with just an int?
2014-10-29 00:13:43	@RelsquiescatInPace	bajr: I get that, my question is why you'd want to
2014-10-29 00:13:46	mancaterwaul	you have to do a bunch of math
2014-10-29 00:13:50	mancaterwaul	basically a series of mods
2014-10-29 00:13:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	o_O not just a mask?
2014-10-29 00:14:04	@bajr	IP addrs >.>
2014-10-29 00:14:09	mancaterwaul	to extract the values of the various bit positions from a decimal-coded bitmask
2014-10-29 00:14:22	@RelsquiescatInPace	decimal c.... why would you
2014-10-29 00:14:23	mancaterwaul	yeah, a mask would work too
2014-10-29 00:14:29	@RelsquiescatInPace	okay, there must be something I'm missing
2014-10-29 00:14:51	mancaterwaul	alternately, you can also do a union of structs
2014-10-29 00:14:53	VanHelsing	well, you can union two custom structs together to get polymorphism
2014-10-29 00:14:58	VanHelsing	dat object-oriented c
2014-10-29 00:15:00	mancaterwaul	^
2014-10-29 00:15:03	mancaterwaul	:)
2014-10-29 00:15:12	mancaterwaul	it's black magic
2014-10-29 00:15:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	hm, okay, I want to think more about how that works when I'm less tired
2014-10-29 00:15:24	@dom	"if a vegan does crossfit which do they talk about first"
2014-10-29 00:15:30	@RelsquiescatInPace	hahaha

2014-10-29 09:12:00	hylleddin	I had not heard of the book. I was mostly interested in the movie because it's stop motion.

2014-10-29 09:33:51	 *	taron only has 12 windows after I steamrolled it by accident the other day
2014-10-29 09:34:08	@bajr	heh
2014-10-29 09:34:38	 *	Fox decided he had too many channels when he had a notification in window 107.

2014-10-29 09:34:53	 *	Fox culled down to 26.
2014-10-29 09:35:01	@bajr	I think my record is 112
2014-10-29 09:35:36	tamarin	taron: so you're saying we should have everyone PM you
2014-10-29 09:35:36	@bajr	safely hovering at 60 now
2014-10-29 09:36:41	taron	tamarin: I kind of figured it's only a matter of time anyway
2014-10-29 09:37:12	taron	though I have mine organized such that if it's any later than 4 or 5 or so I probably don't give a shit about what's going on unless I'm on desk

2014-10-29 10:35:16	nightmarelizer	and dismayed
2014-10-29 10:35:24	nightmarelizer	i have more than 200 more channels than you then
2014-10-29 10:35:31	nightmarelizer	ofc a lot of that is pms that aren't active
2014-10-29 10:35:46	 *	taron takes laptop to work, discovers after getting there that only PSU Secure is available in this corner of the office and it requires installing more packages which I also need the internet for

2014-10-29 10:36:03	nightmarelizer	?
2014-10-29 10:36:13	nightmarelizer	should be installed on the most minimal linux systems

2014-10-29 10:36:51	nightmarelizer	no
2014-10-29 10:36:53	nightmarelizer	you just need that
2014-10-29 10:36:57	nightmarelizer	see link!
2014-10-29 10:37:14	taron	looking now, or attempting to look without looking too much like i'm just fucking around at work >_>
2014-10-29 10:37:17	nightmarelizer	lol
2014-10-29 10:37:26	nightmarelizer	and irc... looks like..... idunno
2014-10-29 10:37:55	taron	it's in a tiny osx terminal so I can tab over to my vagrant box and pretend to be doing things
2014-10-29 10:38:58	taron	also, gotta say this is why i love arch, not necessarily the minimalism but the fact that it forces me to get my shit together and learn new things
2014-10-29 10:41:50	countakula	Hahaha, yeah.  I usually close pms that haven't had activity for a few months
2014-10-29 10:42:01	taron	>months
2014-10-29 10:42:03	taron	o_O
2014-10-29 10:43:18	VanHelsing	countakula: so you regularly look to see what pms you have open?
2014-10-29 10:43:44	VanHelsing	when i hit 100 buffers, it triggers my gc which mostly closes unneeded pms but also channels im done with
2014-10-29 10:51:42	countakula	lol
2014-10-29 10:51:47	countakula	More like
2014-10-29 10:51:58	countakula	"That's weird, I just hit 30 channels, let's see what I don't need"
2014-10-29 10:52:48	VanHelsing	30? wow
2014-10-29 10:52:59	countakula	It's not like I'm in a lotta shit
2014-10-29 10:55:31	VanHelsing	well once you open the freenode floodgate then you get in this state of 'whats one more irc server?'
2014-10-29 10:58:39	taron	fails to parse on the last line of the wpa_supplicant config, i'll poke at it again after I do some actual work for a bit
2014-10-29 11:08:07	countakula	XD Yes, it's true that I would need to connect to freenode to do that
2014-10-29 11:16:22	@relsqui	takua! :)

2014-10-29 11:41:30	countakula	Ouch
2014-10-29 11:42:00	hylleddin	Yeah, I had some good friends at the college, but I'm glad to be out of there.
2014-10-29 11:42:57	hylleddin	We have rocks.
2014-10-29 11:43:01	hylleddin	And trees.
2014-10-29 11:43:39	hylleddin	And particle accelerators. (OK, those were kind of cool.)

2014-10-29 11:46:02	@bajr	it's growing up so quickly
2014-10-29 11:46:15	@bajr	soon it might even take it's first steps
2014-10-29 11:46:31	@bajr	then... the world
2014-10-29 11:46:36	hylleddin	Particle accelerators, plural. We have a bunch of them.
2014-10-29 11:47:00	hylleddin	All the old ones other american colleges don't want anymore get dumped to ISU.
2014-10-29 11:47:21	hylleddin	(I guess I shouldn't be saying "we" anymore to refer to ISU)
2014-10-29 11:47:22	@bajr	hylleddin: so that's where all the CRT monitors go to die...
2014-10-29 11:47:36	hylleddin	LOL.
2014-10-29 11:48:00	hylleddin	Research accelerators, I should say.
2014-10-29 11:48:09	hylleddin	Though we did have a bnuch of old CRTs too.
2014-10-29 11:48:14	@bajr	hehe

2014-10-29 11:49:32	hylleddin	The other half couldn't hear them at all.
2014-10-29 11:49:52	hylleddin	Don't miss them.
2014-10-29 11:50:02	taron	last time I drove through idaho it looked like it might be even further behind than that >_>
2014-10-29 11:50:40	@bajr	ultrahigh-pitched sounds bug me
2014-10-29 11:51:35	@bajr	relsqui: class is where you refill your brain with goo. It'd be a sad day if you lost all your goo.
2014-10-29 11:51:38	@relsqui	what does it say about me that my instinctive response to a new okcupid message is "oh, no"
2014-10-29 11:52:22	taron	meh, I'd probably do the same, if I were even willing to touch that site with a 10 foot pole

2014-10-29 12:18:28	taron	welp, food time. taking any and all available suggestions for which carts are better than others if I ever actually get sick of chopollos (unlikely)
2014-10-29 12:19:01	tamarin	depends on what you like?
2014-10-29 12:19:07	tamarin	(and/or budget)
2014-10-29 12:19:48	taron	budget is currently not a concern, though I am quite fond of paying $6 to get decent food like I could in columbus
2014-10-29 12:20:03	taron	as for what I like, I grew up eating pretty much everything so I don't really care what it is
2014-10-29 12:20:16	tamarin	welp, pick a cart, any cart =P

2014-10-29 12:21:10	taron	been meaning to stop by banh mi but I keep forgetting to go to the atm
2014-10-29 12:21:15	taron	maybe i'll do that friday then
2014-10-29 12:21:22	tamarin	and most of the thai carts...
2014-10-29 12:21:56	tamarin	I think sultan's kitchen is prob most consistant of the mediterranian carts

2014-10-29 12:40:43	@relsqui	it's good but not great :)
2014-10-29 12:40:54	taron	lol wouldn't be first exposure anyway
2014-10-29 12:40:57	@bajr	baan thai has "great" thai food
2014-10-29 12:41:06	tamarin	new taste of india, portland soup cart, hog and hen, comfortably yum, khao man gai for slightly pricier things...
2014-10-29 12:41:45	taron	sometimes I wonder how people come up with the names for these things
2014-10-29 12:41:55	tamarin	heh, just be careful with the heat at baan thai...(also they're more upper end of costs...)
2014-10-29 12:42:20	tamarin	well, I'm guessing new taste of india...there was a taste of india cart somewhere...=P
2014-10-29 12:43:01	tamarin	oh fernando's for some decent big greasy burgers
2014-10-29 12:43:04	@bajr	there's a lot of "* Taste of India" carts
2014-10-29 12:43:12	taron	was actually thinking of comfortably yum, cause taste of india was a thing in columbus as well
2014-10-29 12:43:21	taron	also "curry and hurry"
2014-10-29 12:43:30	tamarin	bajr: yeah...the PSU one used to be New Taste of India 2 cart
2014-10-29 12:43:37	@bajr	Real, New, Original
2014-10-29 12:43:58	tamarin	yeah, taste of india's sort of curry fast-food as an indian friend called it
2014-10-29 12:44:20	tamarin	heh, I also saw just a "Taste of India" cart at one of the pods around downtown recently
2014-10-29 12:44:58	 *	tamarin remembers back in his days, it'll be like $5 for enough food for 2 days >.>
2014-10-29 12:45:46	tamarin	(from NTOI, since that was the only cart around...)
2014-10-29 12:45:59	taron	lol
2014-10-29 12:48:13	taron	found a really good chinese restaurant but it requires too much walking to actually go except on the weekend
2014-10-29 12:48:39	tamarin	what is it?
2014-10-29 12:49:04	taron	lemme look it up, it' sjust a hole in the wall place my mom knows of
2014-10-29 12:49:49	tamarin	most of the good chinese restaurants are in the SE/82nd/Division area these days
2014-10-29 12:50:31	taron	chen's good taste, on 4th somewhere around burnside
2014-10-29 12:51:36	tamarin	ah yeah, that's a good one
2014-10-29 12:51:57	tamarin	actually, prob only good one left in china town these days
2014-10-29 12:52:42	tamarin	Golden Horse is pretty good too, couple of blocks north
2014-10-29 12:52:54	tamarin	(or used to be...haven't been to either in a long time)
2014-10-29 12:56:32	taron	i'll have to mention that to my parents
2014-10-29 12:56:49	taron	easier to let my mother gauge how good it is and then decide if I should go lol
2014-10-29 13:01:19	tamarin	heh taste testers++
2014-10-29 13:01:47	taron	(taste testers from hong kong)++
2014-10-29 13:01:51	tamarin	(for 82nd/Division space, Wong's King, Ocean City are places to try)
2014-10-29 13:02:35	tamarin	o.O
2014-10-29 13:03:03	taron	only vaguely related but I discovered the pho place next to fubonn has beef tendons <3
2014-10-29 13:03:13	taron	now if only it weren't so damn far away
2014-10-29 13:04:38	tamarin	heh the bahn mi cart has a stew that had tendons in it before they changed their menu, not sure if it's there any more
2014-10-29 13:04:46	taron	ohshit
2014-10-29 13:04:52	taron	may have to walk by again after work then
2014-10-29 13:08:47	tamarin	oh also a hot pot place behind FAB that I've yet to try
2014-10-29 13:09:06	tamarin	they might have some tendons
2014-10-29 13:09:17	 *	taron drools
2014-10-29 13:09:39	taron	last hot pot place I went to it was shortly after a funeral and I was lugging about 40 very loud cantonese speaking family members behind me
2014-10-29 13:11:48	tamarin	heh, as they generally are
2014-10-29 13:12:23	tamarin	but the place seems a bit more of a quiet/small group t hing
2014-10-29 13:12:32	tamarin	solo/small group thing
2014-10-29 13:12:34	taron	the last day I was there it took us an hour to stop taking pictures and leave the restaurant, and then we stood in the parking lot for a half hour instead -_-
2014-10-29 13:13:08	tamarin	lulz...sounds about right =P
2014-10-29 13:13:40	taron	least I managed to dodge the karaoke bullet
2014-10-29 13:14:16	tamarin	but a group of people singing badly can be fun
2014-10-29 13:14:26	tamarin	(although better with friends than family -.-)
2014-10-29 13:14:29	taron	not when they're my mother's age lol
2014-10-29 13:14:53	tamarin	heh

2014-10-29 14:00:05	taron	ignored my laptop for a few hours, wpa_supplicant spontaneously decided it wanted to parse things

2014-10-29 15:54:39	askores_monster	lol

2014-10-29 15:55:02	 *	werewheezl is in agreement
2014-10-29 15:55:04	askores_monster	yeah
2014-10-29 15:55:11	werewheezl	chai++ is gr8
2014-10-29 15:55:26	tamarin	taron: you're just letting your subconscious work on the problems to provide a better solution once you're awake >.>
2014-10-29 15:55:31	taron	may have to start checking some of these places out =_= or actually find a decent supply of tea I can stash in FAB 90
2014-10-29 15:55:51	taron	tamarin: there's no such thing as better in drupal, just less terrible to look at
2014-10-29 15:55:58	askores_monster	taron: so yeah secret
2014-10-29 15:56:03	 *	tamarin imagines askore raiding FAB90 from time to time if that happens >.>

2014-10-29 15:56:45	taron	besides walking by it and the bot anyway
2014-10-29 15:56:55	askores_monster	its the food stash in the zonebah
2014-10-29 15:57:14	tamarin	ssh...not sure if zombies are supposed to know about it yet <.<
2014-10-29 15:57:17	askores_monster	lol
2014-10-29 15:57:31	askores_monster	its ok if they know sinfe thy cant easily access it
2014-10-29 15:57:36	taron	to be fair, I already knew about it, just not sure how one goes about paying for that sort of thing
2014-10-29 15:57:37	askores_monster	without other cats helping
2014-10-29 15:58:03	askores_monster	taron: theres a box on top of one of the minifridges into which moneys go
2014-10-29 15:58:10	werewheezl	that is good to know
2014-10-29 15:58:23	askores_monster	(but again, if its tea, no moneys required
2014-10-29 15:58:25	askores_monster	)
2014-10-29 15:58:28	taron	anyway if I can find a place that stocks decent stuff i'll happily supply people with tea
2014-10-29 15:58:31	taron	TIL
2014-10-29 15:58:35	askores_monster	hehe
2014-10-29 15:58:49	taron	I should take a picture of my tea stash in corvallis

2014-10-29 15:59:29	taron	I have a bunch of loose leaf stuff but cleaning and effort
2014-10-29 15:59:41	werewheezl	very tru
2014-10-29 15:59:46	werewheezl	it tastes so good tho
2014-10-29 15:59:52	taron	and the varieties
2014-10-29 16:00:14	 *	werewheezl could wax poetic about loose leaf tea
2014-10-29 16:00:22	 *	werewheezl has a lot of feelings about loose leaf tea
2014-10-29 16:00:27	askores_monster	yeah we should look into like getting tea bags for loose tea
2014-10-29 16:00:31	askores_monster	i know they exist...
2014-10-29 16:00:41	tamarin	karmabot: wheezl is has a lot of wax
2014-10-29 16:00:41	karmabot	Sure, tamarin.
2014-10-29 16:00:51	werewheezl	thanks
2014-10-29 16:00:55	taron	there's a really good store in corvallis, and i'm headed up to victoria for thanksgiving so i'll grab more stuff at murchie's

2014-10-29 16:01:13	werewheezl	and i've got a mesh strainer that works pretty well
2014-10-29 16:01:30	taron	and i can supply a second one of those :D
2014-10-29 16:02:07	taron	i feel like we just spontaneously assembled some sort of tea army
2014-10-29 16:02:10	werewheezl	also you can get lil tea makers that have a mechanical release mechanism on the bottom that you set on top of your mug when the tea is done and the tea comes out but not the leaves :D
2014-10-29 16:02:18	 *	werewheezl joins tea army
2014-10-29 16:02:23	askores_monster	those rock
2014-10-29 16:02:25	tamarin	you could make it sound friendlier and call it a 'party' instead >.> <.<
2014-10-29 16:02:26	taron	:o haven't seen these yet
2014-10-29 16:02:38	askores_monster	doesnt solve the cleaning problem tho
2014-10-29 16:02:50	 *	taron is disappointed she didn't think of that joke
2014-10-29 16:02:54	askores_monster	lol
2014-10-29 16:03:00	werewheezl	yea you still have to dump the leaves and rinse it :////
2014-10-29 16:03:04	askores_monster	mhm
2014-10-29 16:03:09	taron	anyway there are bags somewhere, just gotta find them
2014-10-29 16:03:24	askores_monster	I think I saw them at uwajimaya once
2014-10-29 16:03:27	taron	unfortunately the closest chain I know that has good bags for that is a canadian place >_>
2014-10-29 16:03:31	askores_monster	likely not thr cheapest llace
2014-10-29 16:03:32	werewheezl	again, teavana
2014-10-29 16:03:36	werewheezl	they got those i think
2014-10-29 16:03:39	askores_monster	oh they have them?
2014-10-29 16:03:41	askores_monster	hmmm
2014-10-29 16:03:48	werewheezl	idk how cheap they'd be but yes they do
2014-10-29 16:03:50	werewheezl	i'll google i
2014-10-29 16:03:51	taron	teavana was horrendously expensive in cbus, is it better here?
2014-10-29 16:03:57	askores_monster	lol
2014-10-29 16:03:59	askores_monster	uhh
2014-10-29 16:04:01	taron	cause i'm running out of tea again >_>
2014-10-29 16:04:01	werewheezl	depends on the tea you're getting
2014-10-29 16:04:08	askores_monster	i dont have a frame of reference
2014-10-29 16:04:14	taron	fair point
2014-10-29 16:04:29	werewheezl	something like plain earl grey is like 2$ an ounce
2014-10-29 16:04:44	askores_monster	the fancy ones get like $15/2 oz
2014-10-29 16:04:44	taron	>_>
2014-10-29 16:04:59	askores_monster	the prices are all listed by 2 oz which threw me off
2014-10-29 16:05:16	 *	askores_monster visited the one at pioneer place for the first tjme this weekend
2014-10-29 16:05:37	tamarin	yikes...
2014-10-29 16:05:40	werewheezl	yea
2014-10-29 16:05:58	werewheezl	i looked up the tea bags, it's like 5$ for a box of 100
2014-10-29 16:06:01	tamarin	would be cheaper to fly somewhere and smuggle a bunch back at that rate -.-
2014-10-29 16:06:24	askores_monster	thats not bad werewheezl 
2014-10-29 16:07:14	werewheezl	yea that's for the empty guys you fill yourself
2014-10-29 16:07:15	werewheezl	which is nice

2014-10-29 16:12:40	askores_monster	if it was too much greater we'd always be out of cups.
2014-10-29 16:12:48	taron	lol

2014-10-30 02:32:38	@RelsquiescatInPace	mancaterwaul: I don't know why we thought we needed to bother actually getting drunk
2014-10-30 02:33:09	HowlingDin	As near as I can tell, sleep deprivation is an excellent substitute for alcohol.

2014-10-30 02:38:17	@dom	the speed of the internet alone made me stay in portland my first year
2014-10-30 02:38:31	@dom	"yeah I could go home and go to school for cheap and hang with my friends again"

2014-10-30 02:39:11	@dom	get a 50'
2014-10-30 02:39:12	@dom	I did

2014-10-30 02:39:23	mancaterwaul	>_>

2014-10-30 02:39:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	he taught me how
2014-10-30 02:39:47	 *	taron can also make network cables but hates doing it
2014-10-30 02:39:52	 *	mancaterwaul literally made Kratos a cable when they were dorm mates for exactly that reason
2014-10-30 02:39:57	@RelsquiescatInPace	haha :D
2014-10-30 02:39:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	you are good roomie
2014-10-30 02:40:10	@RelsquiescatInPace	dom: want to illegally split what's supposed to be a single in campus housing
2014-10-30 02:40:11	@dom	I saw kratos in dog meeting last friday
2014-10-30 02:40:19	@RelsquiescatInPace	yah, he's around
2014-10-30 02:40:21	mancaterwaul	that way i didn't feel bad about taking the side with the jacks :P
2014-10-30 02:40:21	@dom	RelsquiescatInPace: do you have to ask
2014-10-30 02:40:31	@RelsquiescatInPace	dom: APPARENTLY, god
2014-10-30 02:40:49	@dom	remember, I slept on the floor here before I got furniture
2014-10-30 02:40:58	@dom	I have slept in WAY WAY WAY WORSE
2014-10-30 02:41:04	@RelsquiescatInPace	oh yeah
2014-10-30 02:41:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	I bet they're still too fucking expensive
2014-10-30 02:41:24	@dom	likely
2014-10-30 02:41:37	@RelsquiescatInPace	half of a single anywhere on campus is probably more than I'm paying right now
2014-10-30 02:41:38	@dom	well
2014-10-30 02:41:39	@RelsquiescatInPace	or at least sa much
2014-10-30 02:41:56	@dom	a furnished double in ondine is $434 a month
2014-10-30 02:42:02	@RelsquiescatInPace	wait srsly
2014-10-30 02:42:04	@dom	yes
2014-10-30 02:42:08	@RelsquiescatInPace	huh.
2014-10-30 02:42:10	@dom	why do you think I was sad to leave
2014-10-30 02:42:15	@dom	I FUCKING LOVE ONDINE
2014-10-30 02:42:24	@RelsquiescatInPace	... I assume you mean "half of a furnished double"
2014-10-30 02:42:27	@dom	yes
2014-10-30 02:42:35	@RelsquiescatInPace	also, what's "furnished" by ondine standards
2014-10-30 02:42:45	@dom	you get a bed, a desk, a dresser and a chair
2014-10-30 02:42:58	@dom	also a sink and a bathroom and kitchen shared with neighbor double
2014-10-30 02:43:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	also also I'm not sure I actually want a living situation where I don't have my own bedroom
2014-10-30 02:43:03	@dom	also a closet half
2014-10-30 02:43:06	@RelsquiescatInPace	because I like getting laid ever
2014-10-30 02:43:17	@dom	yes
2014-10-30 02:43:36	@dom	but ondine has this cool thing with chairs next to the space next to the elevator
2014-10-30 02:43:39	HowlingDin	Dom and I clearly have very different desires for housing
2014-10-30 02:43:46	@RelsquiescatInPace	HowlingDin: howsat?
2014-10-30 02:44:00	HowlingDin	I hated Ondine.
2014-10-30 02:44:09	taron	broadway ftw
2014-10-30 02:44:14	@dom	fuck broadway
2014-10-30 02:44:22	mancaterwaul	^
2014-10-30 02:44:24	@dom	I actually didn't mind the rooms
2014-10-30 02:44:28	@dom	but the elevators sucked
2014-10-30 02:44:30	taron	i'm quite content with my sort of kitchen thing
2014-10-30 02:44:31	@dom	the people sucked
2014-10-30 02:44:34	@RelsquiescatInPace	also the noise
2014-10-30 02:44:39	mancaterwaul	i minded basically everything about broadway
2014-10-30 02:44:40	@dom	( a shopping cart? really)
2014-10-30 02:45:00	@dom	and they closed the stairs for going up during my freshman year
2014-10-30 02:45:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	you guys how many of us are there here whose housing situation is suboptimal
2014-10-30 02:45:02	HowlingDin	Blumel is awesome.

2014-10-30 02:45:52	taron	don't really mind the elevators, no noise problems here, but the people can go fuck themselves
2014-10-30 02:45:55	@RelsquiescatInPace	that's how he gets them
2014-10-30 02:45:58	@RelsquiescatInPace	and that's why they are flakes
2014-10-30 02:46:02	@dom	kek
2014-10-30 02:46:24	HowlingDin	Yeah, that was my trouble with Ondine. I probably would have been OK with it if it wasn't for having a roommate.
2014-10-30 02:46:26	mancaterwaul	deah but the first 6 weeks we kept having to change what we were looking for
2014-10-30 02:46:39	@RelsquiescatInPace	mancaterwaul: did you send the email about the sysc thing or do you want another reminder
2014-10-30 02:46:39	@dom	mancat: yup we sure did
2014-10-30 02:46:53	@RelsquiescatInPace	or neither
2014-10-30 02:47:11	taron	i'd be ok with it if my roommate weren't the most christian person i've ever met
2014-10-30 02:47:19	@RelsquiescatInPace	heh

2014-10-30 02:59:12	@dom	except for like, hunting
2014-10-30 02:59:17	mancaterwaul	i think if they sold a $3 pill at the drug store that just killed your sense of smell forever i would seriously consider buying one
2014-10-30 02:59:20	@dom	probably regressing to hunter/gatherer
2014-10-30 02:59:22	HowlingDin	And I hate flowers' smell, which is of course, what everything is scented.

2014-10-30 09:56:33	taron	join the sleeping in party
2014-10-30 09:56:55	taron	i'm still in bed, 162 is not happening

2014-10-30 10:31:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	:P
2014-10-30 10:31:03	dom	great clips varies greatly on person working at the time
2014-10-30 10:31:14	dom	taron: p sure most of us carry knives everywhere
2014-10-30 10:31:15	@RelsquiescatInPace	I mean, electric clippers aren't really good at cutting anything other than hair
2014-10-30 10:31:18	@RelsquiescatInPace	so there's that
2014-10-30 10:31:48	taron	dom: good, i'm not the only one like I was in ohio then >_>
2014-10-30 10:32:00	@RelsquiescatInPace	I actually don't. I would if I owned a good pocketknife

2014-10-30 11:32:21	taron	man, the inconvenient thing about my life is that i could say i'm from oregon but that's not entirely accurate, nor is saying i'm from ohio
2014-10-30 11:34:58	dom	lie and say you're from canada
2014-10-30 11:35:03	dom	or anywhere else

2014-10-30 11:35:28	@RelsquiescatInPace	he grew up in new zealand, hong kong, and the states
2014-10-30 11:35:37	@RelsquiescatInPace	and when people ask him where he's from he's like "um."
2014-10-30 11:35:42	taron	dom: but I also have canadian citizenship, so
2014-10-30 11:35:46	@RelsquiescatInPace	also, there is literally nowhere he doesn't sound like a foreigner

2014-10-30 11:39:11	@RelsquiescatInPace	this is pretty great
2014-10-30 11:39:24	dom	cuz you smothered the fires with zombie corpses?
2014-10-30 11:39:30	@RelsquiescatInPace	like, I don't have urgent mentor work that needs doing, also I didn't sleep through the first half of my shift and actually got a lot of tickets comped
2014-10-30 11:39:34	@RelsquiescatInPace	this is refreshing.
2014-10-30 11:40:29	@RelsquiescatInPace	and I still think it's ridiculous that my work shifts are the most relaxing and least stressful parts of my week
2014-10-30 11:40:32	@RelsquiescatInPace	but it's still true, so.
2014-10-30 11:40:51	taron	mine were and then drupal and sleep deprivation happened

2014-10-30 11:43:12	tamarin	taron: propose that to will
2014-10-30 11:43:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	taron: maybe this is how you start it!
2014-10-30 11:43:22	taron	currently just me, ant and bret in #arc
2014-10-30 11:43:26	taron	This is true.
2014-10-30 11:43:44	taron	well, and will, but only the other three of us ever say anything
2014-10-30 11:43:56	tamarin	although I highly suggest keeping an eye on it, to make sure it can happen...some places, stashes are a bad idea -.-
2014-10-30 11:44:39	taron	yeah, someone managed to walk out with a mac, but i'm not sure if someone would bother to steal tea
2014-10-30 11:45:23	tamarin	eh, not so much steal, but yes...people do -.-
2014-10-30 11:45:31	taron	:/
2014-10-30 11:46:10	 *	tamarin tried to start a stash in UTS for a while, it was black for a while, then ended up heading towards red once more people heard about it...
2014-10-30 11:47:03	@RelsquiescatInPace	I wonder how zuulweb has impacted the zuul's finances
2014-10-30 11:49:17	taron	kind of tempted to just go for a smaller stash at my desk for now
2014-10-30 11:49:20	wheezl	o/ greetings
2014-10-30 11:49:23	taron	o/
2014-10-30 11:50:34	tamarin	that's prob the best bet
2014-10-30 11:51:09	tamarin	zuul tends to stay a bit over the black these days, but it helps that some people toss more money in

2014-10-30 11:54:53	wheezl	morning!

2014-10-30 11:57:21	taron	well now I can supply them! (actually i'll probably buy my own box first, but either way)
2014-10-30 11:57:23	@RelsquiescatInPace	taron: :D

2014-10-30 11:58:05	wheezl	dude that's awesome
2014-10-30 11:58:20	taron	my one regret is that it's nearly noon and I didn't realize I still don't have pants on until they showed up
2014-10-30 11:59:38	dom	ehhh its fine
2014-10-30 11:59:51	sabreman	php is the worst language ever invented ever
2014-10-30 11:59:52	dom	also google translate doesn't know what chacarron macarron means either
2014-10-30 12:00:08	taron	sabreman: agreed
2014-10-30 12:00:17	tamarin	yeah, nibz'll be pantsless all day if the world would let him
2014-10-30 12:00:38	taron	i'm probably the odd one out but I like my jeans
2014-10-30 12:00:40	sabreman	and now we have to do database stuff using it
2014-10-30 12:00:41	sabreman	D:
2014-10-30 12:00:48	taron	...I am so, so sorry.
2014-10-30 12:00:52	 *	sabreman is uber sad
2014-10-30 12:00:54	@RelsquiescatInPace	oh it is not that bad :|
2014-10-30 12:01:04	 *	RelsquiescatInPace has written a *lot* of PHP
2014-10-30 12:01:05	sabreman	I'd rather use fortran
2014-10-30 12:01:13	sabreman	or forth
2014-10-30 12:01:23	sabreman	or binary
2014-10-30 12:01:35	sabreman	or sticks and stones aranged to simualte a turning machine
2014-10-30 12:01:47	dom	a turing machine?
2014-10-30 12:01:53	dom	or just one that turns

2014-10-30 12:02:00	taron	RelsquiescatInPace: only if it's written properly, and most php devs i've met are far below competent
2014-10-30 12:02:07	sabreman	dom" ?porque no los dos?
2014-10-30 12:02:46	tamarin	seems like bad devs are kind of an issue no matter what language...
2014-10-30 12:03:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah, but I'll agree it can easily be worse when the barrier to entry is lower
2014-10-30 12:03:15	@RelsquiescatInPace	PHP is really accessible
2014-10-30 12:03:23	@RelsquiescatInPace	which means it's easy for people who write shitty code to write a lot of it
2014-10-30 12:03:26	@RelsquiescatInPace	but it's kinda valuable for that too
2014-10-30 12:03:32	taron	yeah
2014-10-30 12:03:34	@RelsquiescatInPace	I wrote a lot of shitty PHP before I started writing halfway decent python :)
2014-10-30 12:03:48	taron	and for that reason i spend a whole lot of time trying to figure out how i can make python more accessible to people
2014-10-30 12:03:48	tamarin	I think it's just attractive because that's what web sites are in most people's minds
2014-10-30 12:04:03	tamarin	so everyone that wants to be a webdev *cough*geocities*cough*
2014-10-30 12:04:16	@RelsquiescatInPace	taron++ that++
2014-10-30 12:04:30	taron	when i lived in columbus i ran a hackathon for people who wanted to learn to code once, was a pretty spectacular failure but made me realize how much i care about that stuff
2014-10-30 12:04:33	sabreman	Real men code their own webservers in c
2014-10-30 12:04:33	@RelsquiescatInPace	tamarin: I love that about webdev! it's the easiest way to show off what you code :D
2014-10-30 12:04:37	@RelsquiescatInPace	taron: that's awesome
2014-10-30 12:04:46	@RelsquiescatInPace	I know some people in SF who are involved in similar projects
2014-10-30 12:04:54	taron	codeday, by any chance?
2014-10-30 12:04:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	especially along the lines of "dear people who are underrepresented in tech. would you like an in? here is an in."
2014-10-30 12:05:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	mm, not afaik
2014-10-30 12:05:08	@RelsquiescatInPace	there are a couple of things, the only one I remember offhand is transcode
2014-10-30 12:05:10	dom	I should go to fabv
2014-10-30 12:05:15	 *	dom -> that
2014-10-30 12:05:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	\o/
2014-10-30 12:05:22	taron	ah, yeah studentrnd/codeday doesn't really do the underrepresented thing
2014-10-30 12:05:31	 *	RelsquiescatInPace ndos
2014-10-30 12:05:34	@RelsquiescatInPace	still though, teaching++
2014-10-30 12:05:36	taron	i mean, the people involved with it really care about it, but it's not their focus
2014-10-30 12:05:51	@RelsquiescatInPace	sure :)
2014-10-30 12:05:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	that is also a good way to be
2014-10-30 12:06:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	I mean, the CAT is like that
2014-10-30 12:06:15	@RelsquiescatInPace	not super explicitly
2014-10-30 12:06:44	taron	reminds me, i remember hearing about mozilla running something either for women or specifically for trans women or something or other, dunno what became of it though
2014-10-30 12:06:52	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah, I dunno
2014-10-30 12:07:02	 *	RelsquiescatInPace doesn't mostly follow those efforts, just hears bits and pieces
2014-10-30 12:07:29	tamarin	there are python things around portland, not too familiar myself...
2014-10-30 12:07:41	tamarin	I think bkero had hosted some pyladies stuff in moz offices before
2014-10-30 12:08:16	tamarin	there's prob python user group meetups in general too...
2014-10-30 12:08:18	taron	last time i went to oscon someone from mongodb dragged me to the pyladies booth >_> that was hella awkward
2014-10-30 12:08:47	tamarin	eh yeah...forced assimilations are always bad...
2014-10-30 12:09:05	tamarin	well, s/bad/awkward/
2014-10-30 12:09:10	tamarin	(awkward can be good >.>)

2014-10-30 12:09:40	taron	meh, was more like "I don't know how I identify but this isn't it please stop" but I can't exactly say that out loud >_>
2014-10-30 12:10:08	tamarin	heh yeah, fair enough
2014-10-30 12:10:29	taron	got a shitload of stickers out of it anyway
2014-10-30 12:10:40	taron	also, the mugs they handed out at the mongodb booth are awesome
2014-10-30 12:11:32	@RelsquiescatInPace	taron: oh man yeah that
2014-10-30 12:12:00	@RelsquiescatInPace	I love that there's tech stuff explicitly about supporting women, but I feel like I can't really participate in it even in a help capacity
2014-10-30 12:12:03	tamarin	(there does tend to be a lot of GSF stuff that tends to happen with geek/nerds...we tend to want to make things mesh...)
2014-10-30 12:12:17	@RelsquiescatInPace	because it exacerbates some assumptions
2014-10-30 12:12:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	which I would not like exacerbated
2014-10-30 12:12:21	taron	RelsquiescatInPace: story of my fucking life, but my dad keeps linking them to me anyway -_-

2014-10-30 12:14:03	taron	I keep reading that as NDAs for some reason >_>
2014-10-30 12:14:08	@RelsquiescatInPace	lol
2014-10-30 12:14:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	I mean it doesn't help when I can't type it
2014-10-30 12:14:26	taron	i'm avoiding those for the moment, the community in columbus was hell
2014-10-30 12:15:08	@RelsquiescatInPace	fair 'nough
2014-10-30 12:15:29	 *	taron is now wondering whether the group she founded over there is still operating or if they finally imploded from sheer force of finger pointing
2014-10-30 12:16:12	tamarin	>.<
2014-10-30 12:16:53	tamarin	not sure what the state of the QRC is these days, but used to be a really good resource...(albeit somewhat hidden)
2014-10-30 12:17:20	tamarin	they've grown a lot since then...so not sure what layer 8 is like now
2014-10-30 12:17:27	 *	RelsquiescatInPace nods
2014-10-30 12:18:15	tamarin	WRC's also a good resource for some (a lot of student services depts are pretty good in general, just not very widely publicized)
2014-10-30 12:18:27	taron	in retrospect, i'm kind of disappointed i unfriended everyone, it would've been fun to watch everyone calling everyone else a transphobic shitpile
2014-10-30 12:18:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	lol
2014-10-30 12:19:05	tamarin	heh pretty sure it's not anywhere that level at least...
2014-10-30 12:19:20	tamarin	(that just sounds plain toxic -.-)
2014-10-30 12:20:18	taron	yeah yet another reason why I moved >_> when the group specifically founded to be friendly to everyone makes you more uncomfortable for questioning than anyone else you know, well...
2014-10-30 12:20:27	taron	other people are strange.

2014-10-30 13:57:12	dom	mancaterwaul: k
2014-10-30 14:00:15	tamarin	mancaterwaul: so why no karlaf koolaid? =)
2014-10-30 14:00:35	 *	tamarin kind of curious (doesn't expect everyone to like her)
2014-10-30 14:01:26	@mancaterwaul	her metaphors are confusing and distracting to me and don't help my learning
2014-10-30 14:01:35	@mancaterwaul	and her assignments are bizarre
2014-10-30 14:01:44	tamarin	ah heh
2014-10-30 14:02:16	@mancaterwaul	she spends a lot of time in 163 talking about how important it is to choose the right data otructure for things, and then tells you to use the wrong ones
2014-10-30 14:02:24	@mancaterwaul	lots of stuff is unclear
2014-10-30 14:02:56	@mancaterwaul	like the time she told me to make a word processor using a linked list of linked lists of arrays, or something
2014-10-30 14:03:19	@mancaterwaul	a word processor is kind of out of scope of that class, and doesn't even really need a data structure
2014-10-30 14:10:34	werewheezl	that sounds unfortuante
2014-10-30 14:11:07	dom	it was
2014-10-30 14:11:23	dom	or when he had to implement inheritance in a c++ translator
2014-10-30 14:11:36	dom	it doesn't need any data structures cuz there isn't any data
2014-10-30 14:11:46	dom	its straight up manipulation of other daa
2014-10-30 14:11:50	dom	didn't make sense at all
2014-10-30 14:12:23	tamarin	huh yeah
2014-10-30 14:12:43	werewheezl	god i hope i don't wind up with that prof
2014-10-30 14:12:58	dom	are you switching to cs?
2014-10-30 14:14:32	@mancaterwaul	there's no chance about it, it's 3 terms with hre guaranteed
2014-10-30 14:14:39	@mancaterwaul	no one else teaches 162, 163, 202
2014-10-30 14:14:42	dom	^ yup
2014-10-30 14:14:49	dom	and ece has to take at least 162/163
2014-10-30 14:14:53	@mancaterwaul	for what it's worth i've had worse teachers
2014-10-30 14:15:01	werewheezl	uncertain, i'm thinking abotu trying out cs tho
2014-10-30 14:15:01	dom	yeah, and she is really flexible
2014-10-30 14:15:34	werewheezl	wait what's the prof's name?
2014-10-30 14:15:38	dom	karlaf
2014-10-30 14:15:39	@mancaterwaul	karla fant
2014-10-30 14:15:49	werewheezl	oh it's not the lady i have right now then
2014-10-30 14:15:51	werewheezl	but noted

2014-10-30 14:36:43	@RelsquiescatInPace	there's a door off this classroom with two signs. one says no food or drink in the computer room. the other says, caution, halon gas used to extinguish this room, if alarm sounds vent before entering 
2014-10-30 14:36:55	@RelsquiescatInPace	I am *so* intrigued 
2014-10-30 14:36:59	dom	kek
2014-10-30 14:37:40	@RelsquiescatInPace	the signs are pretty old and why would there even be a machine room here, much less a halon alarmed one 
2014-10-30 14:38:02	tamarin	RelsquiescatInPace: o.O where's that at?

2014-10-30 14:47:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	today's structural ambiguity from syntax class: "he couldn't explain last night" 
2014-10-30 14:48:49	taron	walking straight into rooms for class that are supposed to be locked except to lab assistants during that hour #justdooraccessthings
2014-10-30 14:50:04	taron	somewhat related, but is there any such thing as semantic ambiguity? we were just doing something similar in philosophy the other day and I didn't pick up on how it was ambiguous because it seemed more a semantic issue than a syntactic one
2014-10-30 14:50:21	taron	i wish i remembered the sentence now
2014-10-30 14:50:27	@RelsquiescatInPace	yes!
2014-10-30 14:51:01	taron	ok good, I feel better about being thoroughly confused then
2014-10-30 14:51:09	taron	didn't want to whip out the pedantry if I didn't know I was right either
2014-10-30 14:51:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	"please pick up the stool on the porch" syntactically clear, lexically ambiguous 
2014-10-30 14:51:16	@RelsquiescatInPace	:P
2014-10-30 14:52:14	taron	lol
2014-10-30 14:53:59	@RelsquiescatInPace	cowal++ for that example from intro, which I have not managed to forget :P
2014-10-30 14:54:46	taron	completely unrelated to the topic, but i'm quite fond of "colorless green ideas sleep furiously"

2014-10-30 15:30:13	@RelsquiescatInPace	no, you didn't get it because you're not on the ling department mailing list :P wasn't sent to all eligible students 
2014-10-30 15:30:44	dom	no, im looking at the requirements for it

2014-10-30 15:31:43	@RelsquiescatInPace	I forget my GPA but I think it's above that?

2014-10-30 15:34:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	when I left hs mine was iirc <1
2014-10-30 15:34:28	@RelsquiescatInPace	definitely <2
2014-10-30 15:35:04	taron	mine was a 4.3 or so weighted, 3.6 unweighted. oh how the tables have turned.
2014-10-30 15:35:28	dom	actually did much better in high school
2014-10-30 15:35:34	dom	since I could bullshit so much more of it
2014-10-30 15:35:49	@RelsquiescatInPace	"can you use any other prepositions here? fond at cheese? fond with cheese? fond to cheese?" "fondue cheese!" (this class)++
2014-10-30 15:36:20	taron	my mother screaming at me all the time forced me to get up and do things instead of crippling anxiety and depression taking over is probably the only reason I made it through high school
2014-10-30 15:36:26	@RelsquiescatInPace	dom: that's why I didn't, honestly 
2014-10-30 15:36:43	dom	the bullshit flows throuh me

2014-10-30 15:37:51	@RelsquiescatInPace	:)
2014-10-30 15:38:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	I bought mancaterwaul a copy on our road trip, because I knew he'd been meaning to 
2014-10-30 15:38:45	taron	anyway, AP lit wasn't any better but at least I could get through it without there being some random person off on the other side of the ocean telling me how I should be thinking about a book
2014-10-30 15:38:47	@RelsquiescatInPace	and happened on it in a random bookstore in a town we were passing through 
2014-10-30 15:38:58	dom	oh man ap lit was the one class I liked
2014-10-30 15:39:16	dom	me and the teach had great conversations about book analysis
2014-10-30 15:39:59	taron	AP physics B ftw, not because of what we learned but because we called it AP starcraft B and acted accordingly
2014-10-30 15:40:48	dom	maybe I can recover this term
2014-10-30 15:40:55	dom	and get better grades than just passing
2014-10-30 15:41:36	taron	i'm just focusing on actually showing up and doing the work, never mind the passing bit
2014-10-30 15:41:53	taron	because if I show up to anything other than work I'm already leagues ahead of where I was last semester at OSU

2014-10-30 15:49:34	nightmarelizer	what does ap starcraft b mean is what im asking
2014-10-30 15:53:19	taron	nightmarelizer: yeah, was literally all we did in that class, cause it was in a computer lab but they were old powerpc macs that could barely handle word but ran starcraft just fine
2014-10-30 15:54:08	nightmarelizer	:D
2014-10-30 15:54:15	nightmarelizer	sounds like the linux lab to me

2014-10-30 17:21:52	@RelsquiescatInPace	I'm not sure there's such thing as "legally should"
2014-10-30 17:21:56	@RelsquiescatInPace	there's "legally must" and "morally should"
2014-10-30 17:22:33	Pash	well, there are situations in which you're not necessarily breaking a law but might be leaving yourelf open to liabilities
2014-10-30 17:23:23	tamarin	RelsquiescatInPace: depends on how you hold laws/morals
2014-10-30 17:23:45	tamarin	I think some instances, people would see it the other way

2014-10-30 17:25:44	@RelsquiescatInPace	that's ... true but irrelevant
2014-10-30 17:25:46	tamarin	traffic law probably has more "legally should" stuff...
2014-10-30 17:26:06	 *	tamarin trying to think of fuzzy areas
2014-10-30 17:28:17	tamarin	I guess it also depends on 'must'...and a person's compulsion to follow either law or morals...

2014-10-30 18:49:36	@mancaterwaul	plus also i hate 3.5 and pathfinder
2014-10-30 18:49:39	tombatman	I played a game once called dungeon crawl classics where you made 4-5 lvl 0 chars and most of them were supposed to die before you reach lvl1
2014-10-30 18:49:47	@mancaterwaul	i think they promote some very bad player behavior
2014-10-30 18:50:24	tombatman	Actually, that was a one-off run by my highschool physics teacher
2014-10-30 18:51:05	tombatman	a character died in the first 20 seconds by kicking a mushroom that released venomous spores
2014-10-30 18:51:22	@mancaterwaul	tombatman: that sounds pretty fun :P
2014-10-30 18:53:07	tombatman	re 3.5, people complain about 4e being too much like a video game, but the level of min-maxing that went on in those systems was ridiculous.
2014-10-30 18:53:25	@mancaterwaul	yeah
2014-10-30 18:53:29	Pash	re gaming, people complain
2014-10-30 18:53:35	tombatman	tru
2014-10-30 18:53:49	@mancaterwaul	lol, yeah, that too
2014-10-30 18:54:00	tombatman	which is weird to me, because I think both can be fun depending on your mindset
2014-10-30 18:54:06	 *	mancaterwaul maintains that the players are more important than the system
2014-10-30 18:54:46	@mancaterwaul	i think the real reason i don't like 3.5 and pathfinder is that by far the majority of people who favor them are people i have no interest in gaming with
2014-10-30 18:54:54	@mancaterwaul	i make exceptions with the right group
2014-10-30 18:55:00	@RelsquiescatInPace	notably, Fox++ ;)
2014-10-30 18:57:51	taron	yeah, I loved the number of options but the people shit all over it
2014-10-30 18:59:47	taron	that and I took forever to come up with characters because I was expected to play something out there all the time
2014-10-30 19:01:05	 *	Fox has karma. Reads up.
2014-10-30 19:01:47	Fox	Ah, this conversation.
2014-10-30 19:01:57	Pash	Yep
2014-10-30 19:01:59	Fox	I've only played Pathfinder. I can't say which systems I like more.
2014-10-30 19:02:14	Fox	I play it for the setting; my friends I play with like it. Paizo has good writing.
2014-10-30 19:02:25	Fox	Not to say other companies don't. We just haven't tried to change.
2014-10-30 19:02:40	@mancaterwaul	i played PF like twice, my initial reaction was to multiclass the two least-likely and least-synergistic classes he could think of, ended up playing a Cavalier/Witch that rode an elk and had a huge arcane spell failure chance because magic is no excuse for not wearing plate mail
2014-10-30 19:03:10	Fox	35% spell failure < full plate witch
2014-10-30 19:03:13	Fox	rule-of-cool prevail
2014-10-30 19:03:20	@mancaterwaul	second character was a rogue that i built completely for backstory, was useless in combat, made the party revive me very fight
2014-10-30 19:04:09	Fox	I don't mind being useless in combat... I don't like that being the integral focus of the game anyway.
2014-10-30 19:04:20	@mancaterwaul	these were both rewarding experiences for me, mostly because i felt that my ability to enjoy my character was at odds with my ability to be effective as a party member, and so i prioritized the first one and damn the consequences
2014-10-30 19:05:15	@mancaterwaul	so i had fun, but i think it was in spite of the system, not because of it
2014-10-30 19:05:28	Fox	Amusingly, my characters tend to end up being the most useful because I'm the only person who enjoys investing in skills.
2014-10-30 19:05:32	Fox	^_^;
2014-10-30 19:07:20	Fox	I think the fun I have isn't due to Pathfinder's ruleset. It's due to the setting. So I can't speak well for Pathfinder so much as Golarion.
2014-10-30 19:08:11	Ghoulem	Fun in tabletops (in my experiance at least) has very little to do with the system, and a lot to do with the dm and players
2014-10-30 19:08:14	 *	mancaterwaul finds the pathfinder setting really dull
2014-10-30 19:08:53	Fox	To each their own, ya.
2014-10-30 19:08:57	Ghoulem	You find dnd in general really dull though
2014-10-30 19:10:59	@mancaterwaul	not entirely
2014-10-30 19:11:18	@mancaterwaul	i like greyhawk and planescape settings
2014-10-30 19:11:20	@mancaterwaul	also dark sun
2014-10-30 19:11:53	Ghoulem	I really have to ask how you differentiate between golarion and greyhawk
2014-10-30 19:12:10	@mancaterwaul	i know greyhawk lore really well :P
2014-10-30 19:12:12	Ghoulem	AH
2014-10-30 19:12:15	Ghoulem	I see ^_^

2014-10-30 21:23:53	tamarin	-.- detergent, water, then clothes...young'uns tsk tsk
2014-10-30 21:24:08	taron	never :P
2014-10-30 21:24:08	@RelsquiescatInPace	*g*
2014-10-30 21:24:11	tamarin	(basically helps dissolve the detergent)
2014-10-30 21:26:40	taron	too lazy to think about these things, I just do it the way my mom does.
2014-10-30 21:27:26	tamarin	but that's how you get bits of crystals stuck on clothes! (yeah...that's how my parents did it too...worked well enough)
2014-10-30 21:27:32	@RelsquiescatInPace	hehe
2014-10-30 21:28:13	tamarin	just one of those things I actually read the instructions for recently, and was like "wha!?" *mind blown*
2014-10-30 21:28:17	@RelsquiescatInPace	lol
2014-10-30 21:29:14	taron	I have not seen these crystals o_O
2014-10-30 21:29:51	tamarin	clearly you need to dump the entire box in next time
2014-10-30 21:29:57	@RelsquiescatInPace	clearly
2014-10-30 21:30:12	tamarin	see, relsqui agrees
2014-10-30 21:30:47	taron	psh
2014-10-30 21:30:51	taron	liquid detergent ftw
2014-10-30 21:31:01	taron	except I really do want to buy the solid stuff and do that now
2014-10-30 21:31:50	tamarin	ah...clearly you need to do some science and crystalize that stuff >.>
2014-10-30 21:32:15	tamarin	(Protip: mixing liquid/bleach first tends to make sure it's evenly spread...)
2014-10-30 21:33:39	taron	Good to know.
2014-10-30 21:41:36	taron	...apparently I opened FFXIV over an hour ago and completely forgot about it

2014-10-30 21:42:51	Epitaph	for four days
2014-10-30 21:47:37	tamarin	and it was *exactly* as if you were playing it for those 4 days -.-

2014-10-30 22:02:44	@RelsquiescatInPace	you have death glares and fruit rollups down to a science?
2014-10-30 22:03:08	taron	oh man if I had the latter everyone would have infinite fruit rollups
2014-10-30 22:03:18	taron	but I do have a box full of them >_>
2014-10-30 22:04:36	tamarin	heh taron++ just stare with fruit rollup hanging there
2014-10-30 22:07:51	taron	don't think I could do it with a straight face but I really want to attempt this now
2014-10-30 22:08:36	tamarin	just need practice, start with other floors >.> <.<
2014-10-30 22:09:11	taron	I don't know anyone on any of the floors besides wheezl, so I could go wherever :D
2014-10-30 22:18:13	tamarin	well, nothing stopping you from staring wheezl down too =)
2014-10-30 22:18:41	tamarin	think of wheezl as the boss fight in trying to keep a serious face heh
2014-10-30 22:20:27	taron	heh not sure I'd even try at that point, but man if I succeeded, the powers I would have...

2014-10-31 11:02:01	tamarin	googling a thing?
2014-10-31 11:02:41	@bajr	how do I go about making my program 'modular', where I can simply tell the program to reload a part of itself, like if I update its code to do a new thing?
2014-10-31 11:02:51	@bajr	(in C)
2014-10-31 11:04:19	tamarin	not particularly sure, but I would think it'll be a matter of being able to load/unload something
2014-10-31 11:04:26	tamarin	and having the program start using it...
2014-10-31 11:05:30	tamarin	thinking if it's loading C, where you have to compile, you'd have to kick things...
2014-10-31 11:05:54	tamarin	but you can have it include like a directory when compiling or somesuch...
2014-10-31 11:09:20	 *	bajr headscratch
2014-10-31 11:10:47	tamarin	otherwise, if it just reads a directory/files, it'll need to interpret the code somehow after loading...not entirely sure how that would be
2014-10-31 11:11:03	 *	tamarin kind of curious how irssi does it
2014-10-31 11:11:24	tamarin	(prob calling perl in some way to do the interpreting?)
2014-10-31 11:16:16	@mancaterwaul	bajr: may i suggest having your C program compile itself with new code, hen make an exec() call?
2014-10-31 11:16:30	@mancaterwaul	that's basically what bash does except that with C you have to do it by hand instead fo calling functions
2014-10-31 11:16:34	 *	mancaterwaul shug
2014-10-31 11:16:39	 *	mancaterwaul shrug too
2014-10-31 11:17:30	tamarin	mancat++
2014-10-31 11:18:31	@mancaterwaul	or if you're just looking for config updates, give it a function that parses a config file and sets some globals. then you can recall that function during execution if you need to change that stuff.
2014-10-31 11:19:12	@mancaterwaul	but in that case you're limited to predefined behavior patterns based on what you write into it
2014-10-31 11:48:53	@bajr	mancat++
2014-10-31 11:49:30	@bajr	that seems like an acceptable solution, I think

2014-10-31 12:18:12	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeahh
2014-10-31 12:18:12	tamarin	RelsquiescatInPace: yeah...was so tempting to do that today...if it wasn't for having set up some time to troubleshoot with people... -.- (and then having them be an hr late...)
2014-10-31 12:18:35	@RelsquiescatInPace	:(
2014-10-31 12:18:43	taron	:/
2014-10-31 12:19:01	@RelsquiescatInPace	I like it when I can narrow my day down to a cat day
2014-10-31 12:19:17	@RelsquiescatInPace	i.e. I have hiss meeting, dog meeting, bd
2014-10-31 12:19:45	tamarin	heh, cat days are the only reason I didn't drop out of school
2014-10-31 12:20:13	taron	student loans would fuck me up the ass if I ever dropped out
2014-10-31 12:20:17	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah.
2014-10-31 12:20:20	@RelsquiescatInPace	that.
2014-10-31 12:20:31	@RelsquiescatInPace	although I think I might be able to go to half time, need to talk to finaid about it
2014-10-31 12:20:38	@RelsquiescatInPace	I'd been fretting about it because I'd lose some of my pell grant
2014-10-31 12:20:49	@RelsquiescatInPace	had totally forgotten I'd also lose some of my tuition
2014-10-31 12:20:50	tamarin	helps to have options to disappear >.>
2014-10-31 12:20:52	@RelsquiescatInPace	and the differences are comparable
2014-10-31 12:21:22	tamarin	yeah...
2014-10-31 12:21:33	tamarin	also don't forget to look at potential scholarships
2014-10-31 12:21:42	@RelsquiescatInPace	yeah, it's on my list.

2014-10-31 13:26:06	@bajr	always
2014-10-31 13:27:17	drbopenstein	Pants before socks.  But that's because the pants are put on when I get out of the shower while socks are put on when I leave the house.
2014-10-31 13:27:30	countakula	Damn right
2014-10-31 13:30:57	taron	I do not understand anyone who can put socks on immediately after getting out of the shower.
2014-10-31 13:31:57	dom	why not
2014-10-31 13:32:14	taron	wet socks are a heresy of the highest order.

2014-10-31 13:36:39	taron	I have been scarred by multiple showerheads that sprayed half the water out the side so that even if you put a towel down or dried your feet you'd end up tracking water everywhere anyway -_-

2014-10-31 13:58:49	dom	I do that too except thats cuz the holes in my shoes make my socks sopping wet
2014-10-31 13:59:38	countakula	See they just constrict me.

2014-11-02 01:04:56	@bajr	johnj is also snot, crack, services.cecs, and all the other webdev stuff too
2014-11-02 01:05:19	dom	syndicat does webdev for some stuff
2014-11-02 01:05:27	dom	but all of the services are 100% johnj
2014-11-02 01:05:29	@relsqui	I thought that's just what that team *is* >_>
2014-11-02 01:05:46	dom	syndicat is intranet + webdev projects + "documentation"
2014-11-02 01:06:05	dom	documentation was the original point of the team, but thats fallen by the wayside
2014-11-02 01:06:22	@bajr	heh
2014-11-02 01:06:38	dom	technically syndicat should update chronicle, not hiss
2014-11-02 01:06:40	dom	:)
2014-11-02 01:06:47	@relsqui	don't tempt me ;)
2014-11-02 01:07:06	dom	no, enigma knows about it and wants us to do it
2014-11-02 01:07:13	dom	but concedes that hiss has members
2014-11-02 01:07:16	dom	and syndicat has hiss members
2014-11-02 01:07:23	dom	not much else
2014-11-02 01:07:24	dom	kek
2014-11-02 01:07:25	@relsqui	heh
2014-11-02 01:08:11	@bajr	hmm, not entirely sure that documentation was actually syndicat's thing
2014-11-02 01:08:23	dom	ask johnj, thats what he told us
2014-11-02 01:08:27	dom	and enigma confirmed it
2014-11-02 01:08:32	dom	like way back in the day
2014-11-02 01:08:37	dom	then syndicat got reborn
2014-11-02 01:08:42	dom	and now we do webdev
2014-11-02 01:08:45	@bajr	syndicat didn't really get going until basil did some thing as a hiss member, which was then taken by enigma/bighong when we singled them out for it
2014-11-02 01:08:58	@relsqui	I didn't realize it was that young
2014-11-02 01:08:58	dom	^ the rebirth
2014-11-02 01:09:06	dom	it existed years ago apparently
2014-11-02 01:09:08	@bajr	ah true
2014-11-02 01:09:10	dom	like 8
2014-11-02 01:09:16	@relsqui	make sense
2014-11-02 01:11:15	dom	syndicat needs work >>
2014-11-02 01:15:15	@relsqui	dom: any suggestions for what to say about syndicat roles?
2014-11-02 01:16:09	dom	does work on user-facign web services?
2014-11-02 01:16:12	Pash	this is the legend of the SyndiCAT, passed down generation after generation, by our people
2014-11-02 01:16:12	dom	facing
2014-11-02 01:16:14	@relsqui	er, rather
2014-11-02 01:16:18	@relsqui	about the team structure, I mean
2014-11-02 01:16:32	@relsqui	my understanding is that it's pretty much flat, you show up and do what you can/get access as needed?
2014-11-02 01:16:35	@relsqui	something like that?
2014-11-02 01:16:35	dom	enigma leads, we get brought projects by senior cats who assume lead of that project part
2014-11-02 01:16:38	dom	yeah
2014-11-02 01:16:49	dom	enigma leads overall, when we get projects we get project leads as interims
2014-11-02 01:17:05	dom	just say enigma is lead
2014-11-02 01:17:11	dom	its too complicated otherwise
2014-11-02 01:17:22	dom	syndicats show up, get taught the basics, then become a full member
2014-11-02 01:17:23	@relsqui	I just want a line to explain why this section doesn't have a nice table like the other sections :)
2014-11-02 01:17:29	dom	yeah lol
2014-11-02 01:17:40	dom	its baseline, do these things and you're a syndicat
2014-11-02 01:18:11	dom	(things == codecademy stuff)
2014-11-02 01:18:15	dom	mostly
2014-11-02 01:18:21	@relsqui	how's that? https://chronicle.cat.pdx.edu/projects/cat/wiki/Team_Roles
2014-11-02 01:18:23	link-bot	Chronicle (http://goo.gl/lFpTk9)
2014-11-02 01:18:38	dom	yeah, that works
2014-11-02 01:18:47	@relsqui	cool.
2014-11-02 01:21:03	Pash	one day, I will gather our kittens around the fire, and tell them of our brave warriors, enigma and basil, and how they slew the fearsome syndiCAT, that they could make from its bones the foundations of our Document Nation
2014-11-02 01:21:32	@relsqui	you should definitely do that
2014-11-02 01:21:33	@relsqui	we'll have to make a fire
2014-11-02 01:21:37	dom	and tell them "yeah, that is why the new website is so hard to get around. shut up and eat your dinner"
2014-11-02 01:21:41	dom	I can make the fire
2014-11-02 01:21:42	dom	pick me
2014-11-02 01:21:46	dom	ooh ooh

2014-11-02 01:23:04	@bajr	I choose Cactuar!
2014-11-02 01:23:15	@bajr	Cactuar, use 10,000 needles!
2014-11-02 01:23:54	Pash	one of my favorite playthroughs was when I traded my starter for a dratini egg asap
2014-11-02 01:24:02	Pash	I pretended dratini was my starter
2014-11-02 01:24:18	dom	oh man I like the newer games where you can wonder trade
2014-11-02 01:24:25	dom	basically throw shit up in the air and see what falls down
2014-11-02 01:24:41	@relsqui	lol
2014-11-02 01:25:23	Pash	I wonder if I could bring my DS to school and use our wifi for trades....
2014-11-02 01:25:30	dom	probably could
2014-11-02 01:25:37	dom	and by probably, I mean definitely
2014-11-02 01:25:39	dom	its fucking easy

2014-11-02 01:35:41	dom	you can emulate the games really easily
2014-11-02 01:35:46	dom	they're pretty fun games
2014-11-02 01:35:52	dom	but kind of easy if you're not 12
2014-11-02 01:36:08	dom	there are lots of fan made games that are much funner and harder
2014-11-02 01:36:59	@bajr	huh
2014-11-02 01:37:23	dom	fans took the base code and made new games?
2014-11-02 01:37:37	Pash	bajr: I'd say you're missing out, at least a bit
2014-11-02 01:37:48	dom	they use mainly visualboyadvance, which if you didn't know, is the premier gba emulator :P

2014-11-02 12:09:47	@bajr	so, I have a function that receives a string, does a thing with that string, and then, since it's the last instance in that string's life, frees the memory of the string
2014-11-02 12:10:43	@bajr	The problem is that C can't detect if the string is a literal (allocated on the stack) or dynamically allocated

2014-11-02 12:13:45	@bajr	hack solution: pass a flag telling the function if the string is literal or not

2014-11-02 14:48:45	@bajr	hmm...
2014-11-02 14:49:02	@bajr	should i make dice rolling more permissive or restrictive of the arguments it's given?
2014-11-02 14:49:24	@bajr	like... should it do 3d6 + derp and just ignore the derp?
2014-11-02 14:54:08	Pash	permissive.  3d6 + derp should show a number + derp
2014-11-02 14:54:57	@bajr	"3d6 + derp = 12 + derp" for example?
2014-11-02 14:55:04	Pash	right
2014-11-02 14:55:13	Golem	if you really want to go crazy, it can then display the total
2014-11-02 14:55:26	@bajr	Golem: eh?
2014-11-02 14:55:33	@bajr	not sure I follow

2014-11-02 14:56:34	Golem	maybie I am not following what you are trying to do with this dice roller
2014-11-02 14:56:50	Golem	but if you are doing dnd dice style rolling, the result is more important than the roll
2014-11-02 14:57:06	@bajr	ah, something like "3d6 + 2" is easy to do
2014-11-02 14:57:08	Golem	you roll 3d6 + 10 you want to know how much damage you do, not what the result of the roll is
2014-11-02 14:57:25	@bajr	but in this case derp is a string, so "3d6 + derp" is undefined
2014-11-02 14:57:25	--	VanHelsing is now known as jesusaurus
2014-11-02 14:58:37	Golem	why do it as a string?
2014-11-02 14:58:40	Golem	if I may ask
2014-11-02 14:58:52	@bajr	error handling
2014-11-02 14:58:58	@bajr	well kinda
2014-11-02 14:59:27	@bajr	more like, I should be able to do something like "4d6 - L" to roll 4d6 and remove the lowest roll
2014-11-02 14:59:41	@bajr	or "4d6 - H" to remove the highest roll
2014-11-02 14:59:43	Golem	that sounds more like you want to do replacement
2014-11-02 15:00:21	Golem	"I see dice rolling minus a charecter, do the thing"
2014-11-02 15:00:43	Golem	then again I might have just been indoctrinated by karla
2014-11-02 15:01:29	@bajr	this would be a lot easier in c++, admittedly
2014-11-02 15:02:23	@bajr	but C isn't smart enough to automatically type the argument correctly, so I have to throw it into a string first and figure out if it's an integer after that (I think)
2014-11-02 15:03:18	@bajr	s/integer/integer or a character/
2014-11-02 15:05:08	@bajr	sscanf(arg, "%sd%s %c %s", num, sides, oper, mod);

2014-11-02 16:05:17	Epitrope	to get integers?
2014-11-02 16:12:14	@bajr	kinda?
2014-11-02 16:12:40	@bajr	it could if the only valid input was integers
2014-11-02 16:15:42	Epitrope	what other inputs are valid there?
2014-11-02 16:19:54	@bajr	the first two can be empty strings (i.e. d20 = 1d20, 3d = 3d6, d = 1d6)
2014-11-02 16:21:11	@bajr	or the second one can be bajr (3dbajr = bajrbajrbajr), but that's a less important functionality
2014-11-02 16:22:11	@bajr	the 3rd %i could be L or H (i.e. 4d6 - L removes the lowest roll)
2014-11-02 16:59:19	Epitrope	ah, that makes sense
2014-11-02 18:40:12	relsqui	oh, neat

2014-11-02 20:45:16	relsqui	it's okay
2014-11-02 20:45:21	relsqui	civ-themed incremental/clicker game
2014-11-02 20:45:41	relsqui	but I'm working on an achievement where you only resource-click the minimal number of times to get the ball rolling and then have your population build stuff up for you
2014-11-02 20:45:44	relsqui	and the beginning is really tedious

2014-11-02 20:48:31	relsqui	hehehe
2014-11-02 20:48:46	taron	especially since you have to watch and make sure no one dies and shit instead of just leaving it and going off to work or whatever
2014-11-02 20:48:53	relsqui	cottage yesssss
2014-11-02 20:49:07	relsqui	grooooowth
2014-11-02 20:49:31	relsqui	food and wood and stone are ALL going up now

2014-11-02 20:50:56	relsqui	PKJamoo: that's stuck in my head now, wtg >_>
2014-11-02 20:51:49	taron	two more
2014-11-02 20:52:20	taron	I have HAD it with these motherfucking mushrooms in my motherfucking dungeon
2014-11-02 20:52:25	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-02 20:52:39	taron	...oh look, there's another one
2014-11-02 20:56:00	relsqui	woooo pop. 50
2014-11-02 21:02:25	PKJamoo	haha
2014-11-02 21:06:00	taron	pull lever, receive more angry mushrooms
2014-11-02 21:06:18	relsqui	I can't tell if I'm enjoying not knowing what you're talking about more than I'd enjoy knowing what you're talking about

2014-11-02 21:07:29	taron	legend of grimrock
2014-11-02 21:07:35	relsqui	oh, right, you totally even said that -_-
2014-11-02 21:07:58	taron	:P
2014-11-02 21:08:27	relsqui	@_@ there's probably something I should be doing instead of playing this game
2014-11-02 21:08:38	PKJamoo	I didn't especially enjoy that game
2014-11-02 21:08:53	PKJamoo	even within the first 10 minutes it started feeling repetitive
2014-11-02 21:09:13	taron	yeah it bothered me as well, but hte way it reminds me of the Quest for iOS has kept me going
2014-11-02 21:09:18	tamgc	relsqui: there's a lot of things instead of playing *clicker games -.-
2014-11-02 21:09:24	taron	relsqui: same thought >_>
2014-11-02 21:09:48	relsqui	yeahhhh
2014-11-02 21:09:55	relsqui	I mean civclicker is at least highly resource-managey
2014-11-02 21:09:58	relsqui	which is halfway respectable, lol
2014-11-02 21:10:26	tamgc	yeah, actually looks like it's potentially a game
2014-11-02 21:11:03	 *	tamgc has slight pet peeve about actual *clicker games being "games" -.-
2014-11-02 21:11:33	 *	relsqui can't really identify with the precise definition of a game being that important to you, but knock yourself out ;)
2014-11-02 21:15:07	tamgc	heh can't say it's a rational pet peeve (but afaik, I don't think any pet peeves are really rational...)
2014-11-02 21:15:27	relsqui	yesss
2014-11-02 21:15:31	relsqui	okay, population has passed that of mancat's hometown

2014-11-02 21:16:28	taron	this game is beginning to make me think I have a hoarding problem
2014-11-02 21:16:44	taron	I know full well there probably won't be vendors but I HAVE to pick up every shield and spear anyway
2014-11-02 21:17:41	tamgc	I think that's a standard in RPGs =0
2014-11-02 21:17:44	tamgc	=)*
2014-11-02 21:18:13	taron	hm, true.

2014-11-02 21:21:26	taron	least they don't eat your buildings or anything
2014-11-02 21:21:32	relsqui	-_- true
2014-11-02 21:23:16	relsqui	oh, I guess I can also make palisades, that'll help
2014-11-02 21:25:25	relsqui	trying to figure out which nonbasic resource I'll want to get first
2014-11-02 21:25:59	taron	i'd go for skins because soldiers, personally
2014-11-02 21:26:03	relsqui	yeah, that's my instinct as well
2014-11-02 21:26:04	taron	dunno how much it matters though
2014-11-02 21:26:12	relsqui	oh, yeah.
2014-11-02 21:26:15	relsqui	soldiers -> conquest -> more resources.
2014-11-02 21:26:16	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-02 21:26:24	taron	and all the dead things.

2014-11-02 21:26:49	taron	hahaha
2014-11-02 21:27:00	taron	best to bury them til you get the god of the underworld anyway
2014-11-02 21:27:15	relsqui	I mean, I can't, because I can't get clerics, because I can't get temples
2014-11-02 21:27:16	relsqui	>_>
2014-11-02 21:27:19	relsqui	or graveyards
2014-11-02 21:27:19	relsqui	so.
2014-11-02 21:27:35	relsqui	maybe this is the right one for it, lol
2014-11-02 21:27:42	taron	...fair point. maybe go for herbs to keep the disease down first then
2014-11-02 21:28:02	relsqui	I still think skins actually, because conquest will make it way easier to get all the others
2014-11-02 21:28:19	relsqui	erk. otoh I already have dead people.
2014-11-02 21:28:22	relsqui	er, sick
2014-11-02 21:28:23	relsqui	hmmm

2014-11-02 21:29:52	relsqui	that was unintentionally really smart
2014-11-02 21:30:03	relsqui	that said, my sick number is not going down :/
2014-11-02 21:33:45	taron	I suppose the point would be to keep the percentage from going up anyway
2014-11-02 21:33:51	relsqui	yeah
2014-11-02 21:34:36	relsqui	I'm not watching closely enough to tell if that's happening but I don't think so
2014-11-02 21:34:38	taron	also if it makes you feel any better, I am now down to 3/4 of my party >_>
2014-11-02 21:34:45	taron	er, 1/4 >_>

2014-11-02 21:35:31	taron	now I get another chance to fail spectacularly
2014-11-02 21:35:31	tombat	so, I guess this game is like cookie clicker with fail conditions?

2014-11-02 21:35:49	relsqui	but the one I'm playing could be described that way, yeah

2014-11-02 21:36:48	relsqui	oh shit overcrowding

2014-11-02 21:37:32	relsqui	come on, everybody, we can do it
2014-11-02 21:37:42	relsqui	just gotta build up trade goods x_x
2014-11-02 21:38:24	taron	welp
2014-11-02 21:38:28	taron	RIP other tank
2014-11-02 21:38:30	relsqui	lol
2014-11-02 21:38:55	relsqui	oh geeze I just realized that means I can't build ore storehouses either
2014-11-02 21:38:56	taron	because I have no idea how to heal poison
2014-11-02 21:38:59	relsqui	just gotta fill 'em
2014-11-02 21:39:00	relsqui	and pray
2014-11-02 21:39:05	taron	lol
2014-11-02 21:39:13	taron	welcome to neverclick :D
2014-11-02 21:39:19	relsqui	hahahaha
2014-11-02 21:39:25	relsqui	yeah now I understand.
2014-11-02 21:39:46	relsqui	45k wood trade req x_x come oooon
2014-11-02 21:39:47	taron	gratuitous abuse of the save button!
2014-11-02 21:40:14	taron	1/2 of the party remaining, I am sorely tempted to just launch myself down this pit here
2014-11-02 21:40:26	relsqui	lol
2014-11-02 21:41:10	taron	aaaaand then earthquake o_O
2014-11-02 21:41:16	relsqui	taron: I'm guessing the necropolis thing is also a good way to get the plague city achievement >_>
2014-11-02 21:41:28	taron	relsqui: yup
2014-11-02 21:41:57	taron	least I remember it working that way
2014-11-02 21:42:05	relsqui	yeah.
2014-11-02 21:42:20	relsqui	if I make it through this run all I'll have left is plague city/seven wonders/the deity ones
2014-11-02 21:43:51	relsqui	okay, max population
2014-11-02 21:44:07	relsqui	now we see which happens first, trade offer I can take, or everyone dies
2014-11-02 21:44:17	taron	hahaha
2014-11-02 21:44:57	taron	borderline ragequitting for skyrim or something >_>
2014-11-02 21:45:40	relsqui	lol
2014-11-02 21:45:54	relsqui	taron: what happens if I keep building when everyone's already angry due to overcrowding, anyway?
2014-11-02 21:46:09	@mancat	are you playing civ5 over there?
2014-11-02 21:46:14	 *	relsqui coughs
2014-11-02 21:46:18	relsqui	not exactly
2014-11-02 21:46:27	taron	relsqui: nothing that I'm aware of, your productivity just keeps being bad due to the anger I think
2014-11-02 21:46:32	relsqui	oh is that what that does
2014-11-02 21:46:33	relsqui	makes sense
2014-11-02 21:46:40	relsqui	so it's still counterproductive
2014-11-02 21:46:43	taron	yep
2014-11-02 21:47:29	relsqui	mancat: it's nominally a civ clicker game, but really I think calling it a clicker is an excuse not to have any graphics and be on the web
2014-11-02 21:47:33	relsqui	it's a resource management game
2014-11-02 21:48:33	 *	relsqui sees trade offer, jumps, it's skins -_-
2014-11-02 21:49:00	taron	eventually I just gave up and turned to javascript for that shit
2014-11-02 21:49:06	relsqui	haha
2014-11-02 21:49:19	relsqui	yeah but at that point I could, like
2014-11-02 21:49:22	relsqui	write a high number down on a piece of paper
2014-11-02 21:49:23	relsqui	>_>
2014-11-02 21:49:25	relsqui	if I'm just choosing it
2014-11-02 21:49:52	taron	not quite like that, there's a way to trigger a trader showing up
2014-11-02 21:49:58	relsqui	oh, yeah
2014-11-02 21:50:02	relsqui	well, I have the unlock which makes them come more often
2014-11-02 21:50:03	relsqui	which helps
2014-11-02 21:50:04	taron	same amount of rage, just faster
2014-11-02 21:50:06	relsqui	lol
2014-11-02 21:50:13	relsqui	oh god wolves
2014-11-02 21:50:20	relsqui	there are so many
2014-11-02 21:50:50	 *	relsqui stands by and watches them eat everybody
2014-11-02 21:51:00	taron	bwahahah
2014-11-02 21:51:32	relsqui	at least they don't leave corpses <_<
2014-11-02 21:52:21	taron	this is true.
2014-11-02 21:53:26	relsqui	x_x they're dead
2014-11-02 21:53:34	relsqui	I'm up to 555 sick in a population of 4608
2014-11-02 21:53:42	taron	:/
2014-11-02 21:53:48	relsqui	573
2014-11-02 21:53:58	tamgc	ebola epidemic!
2014-11-02 21:54:00	relsqui	I'm actually seriously entertained by it at this point
2014-11-02 21:54:00	tamgc	quarantine!
2014-11-02 21:54:03	relsqui	which will happen first?!
2014-11-02 21:54:08	relsqui	plague? starvation? wolves?
2014-11-02 21:54:13	relsqui	or the one trader who can save the town
2014-11-02 21:54:32	tamgc	that sounds like a movie plot heh
2014-11-02 21:54:34	taron	reverse russian roulette. 5/6 are loaded.
2014-11-02 21:54:37	relsqui	right?
2014-11-02 21:54:37	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-02 21:54:40	relsqui	yes
2014-11-02 21:55:16	relsqui	even worse question: has the trade offer already come and I didn't notice because I was watching you guys >_> or clicker heroes
2014-11-02 21:55:35	relsqui	ore offer
2014-11-02 21:55:48	relsqui	and wood storehouse full
2014-11-02 21:56:06	relsqui	stone storehouse full
2014-11-02 21:56:21	relsqui	er, food, rather
2014-11-02 21:57:53	relsqui	someone on the wiki pointed out that if you run out of food, the sick die first >_> so you can reduce your sick population that way
2014-11-02 21:57:57	relsqui	but I won't resort to that unless I have to -_-
2014-11-02 21:58:21	taron	roulette's more interesting anyway, I think
2014-11-02 21:58:22	relsqui	taron: I might change my mind about getting herbs first
2014-11-02 21:59:17	relsqui	offer .... metal
2014-11-02 21:59:25	taron	alright this is silly, I'm getting another cup of tea and playing something else for a bit =_=
2014-11-02 21:59:29	relsqui	haha
2014-11-02 22:00:11	relsqui	all stores full, put everybody on farming so as to stave off starvation due to sick farmers as long as possible
2014-11-02 22:00:15	relsqui	817 sick now
2014-11-02 22:00:57	taron	and now we wait.
2014-11-02 22:00:59	relsqui	yes.
2014-11-02 22:01:05	relsqui	I think if I get plague city I'll try to starve off the dying
2014-11-02 22:01:56	relsqui	odds are I won't actually have to choose, I'm likely to be able to get more than one gold at once
2014-11-02 22:02:00	relsqui	if I get *any* good trade offer
2014-11-02 22:02:04	relsqui	if it's 50k of something, welp.
2014-11-02 22:02:16	taron	yeah...
2014-11-02 22:02:27	relsqui	80k wood ;_; you tease
2014-11-02 22:05:33	relsqui	1042 sick
2014-11-02 22:06:12	relsqui	I might not actually get a chance to starve the sick on purpose if I get to plague city
2014-11-02 22:06:23	relsqui	I don't think the population will be able to farm enough to sustain themselves
2014-11-02 22:06:56	relsqui	yup, just crossed that line
2014-11-02 22:07:09	relsqui	everyone who can work is farming and I'm eating food faster than I'm harvesting it
2014-11-02 22:07:15	taron	welp
2014-11-02 22:07:29	taron	thus the advantage of zombies though
2014-11-02 22:07:33	relsqui	lol, yes
2014-11-02 22:07:33	relsqui	hmm
2014-11-02 22:07:38	relsqui	I might still want to do it on purpose, actually
2014-11-02 22:07:41	relsqui	so I'll still have food to rebuild after
2014-11-02 22:07:49	taron	true
2014-11-02 22:07:59	relsqui	wait, that's not how that works
2014-11-02 22:08:04	relsqui	they don't starve until there's no food
2014-11-02 22:08:16	relsqui	I just have to keep making new people and making them farmers as fast as I can
2014-11-02 22:08:20	relsqui	losing food at 100/s ...
2014-11-02 22:08:27	relsqui	sick nearly at 1200
2014-11-02 22:08:28	relsqui	this is fascinating
2014-11-02 22:09:58	relsqui	food under 5k, and ...
2014-11-02 22:10:10	relsqui	metal offer, lol
2014-11-02 22:10:30	relsqui	and starvation.
2014-11-02 22:10:42	relsqui	ah, and the sick are dying unilaterally first
2014-11-02 22:10:47	relsqui	so this is actually going to reach equilibrium
2014-11-02 22:11:03	relsqui	and there it is.
2014-11-02 22:11:20	relsqui	food reserves increasing again, but no more sick are dying
2014-11-02 22:11:33	relsqui	but I can slowly make new workers
2014-11-02 22:11:47	relsqui	to build the farming population back up
2014-11-02 22:11:54	relsqui	orry, this is probably not actually that interesting from outside, lol
2014-11-02 22:12:20	taron	I'm enjoying it at least.
2014-11-02 22:12:57	relsqui	heh, sickness spike again, hit another equilibrium
2014-11-02 22:13:25	relsqui	I can now make ~200 more people but only 1-2 at a time as I very very slowly build up food
2014-11-02 22:13:29	relsqui	-_- herbs offer
2014-11-02 22:13:49	relsqui	wait, I *can* tweak this equilibrium on purpose
2014-11-02 22:13:54	taron	can't decide what to play still, seriously contemplating the lego movie
2014-11-02 22:14:03	 *	relsqui is cruel citymaster

2014-11-02 22:15:23	relsqui	I thought that was masochism >_>
2014-11-02 22:15:31	taron	lol combination of both
2014-11-02 22:15:40	relsqui	interesting, the number of people who starve each round seems to be fixed
2014-11-02 22:16:05	taron	leadership is the highest form of masochism, but there's nothing quite as much fun as making some poor bastard at his keyboard miserable cause you destroyed his 6bil ship
2014-11-02 22:16:07	relsqui	watch the trade offer be food
2014-11-02 22:16:11	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-02 22:17:06	relsqui	if I'd realized how this worked it would've been wise to do it earlier

2014-11-03 00:27:31	taron	anyway, happy to help out wherever I can, and I'm of half a mind to start making myself do things like that to get my anxiety talking to other people down whether I like it or notr

2014-11-03 00:28:42	taron	anything's better than the way I threw myself under the bus taking a public speaking class my first quarter after my anxiety hit the point where I could no longer leave my apartment most of the time >_>
2014-11-03 00:28:52	relsqui	ouch
2014-11-03 00:28:57	taron	hooray for bad ideas!
2014-11-03 00:28:59	relsqui	lol
2014-11-03 00:29:03	relsqui	nice to get 'em out of the way
2014-11-03 00:29:06	taron	indeed
2014-11-03 00:29:38	taron	and after how spectacularly I've been failing at that class I'm somehow more motivated to take my fear and leave it lying for dead in a ditch somewhere
2014-11-03 00:30:07	relsqui	yeah, I imagine
2014-11-03 00:30:09	relsqui	"fuck this thing."
2014-11-03 00:30:16	relsqui	speaking of bad ideas, though, afk getting a drink with mancat before going home

2014-11-03 00:35:10	taron	suddenly I realize I've been using tail -f without ever bothering to actually learn what that flag does
2014-11-03 00:35:12	dom	*gwb*
2014-11-03 00:35:53	dom	I learned what the flag meant, but only because I had to learn EVERYTHING about linux in the last year or so
2014-11-03 00:35:57	dom	everything I know, I mean
2014-11-03 00:36:21	taron	makes sense
2014-11-03 00:36:28	taron	I think I'd do well to learn it, bd or no

2014-11-03 13:47:27	@bajr	that's C trying to do unusual things with ints

2014-11-03 15:46:06	tombat	would you consider adding a function where it will show all individual rolls?

2014-11-03 15:47:18	relsqui	also
2014-11-03 15:47:31	relsqui	I sat down to procrastinate and am accidentally studying
2014-11-03 15:47:35	relsqui	not .... actually sure how that works
2014-11-03 15:47:39	relsqui	I mean, I'm doing both
2014-11-03 15:47:43	wheezl	what how does that work
2014-11-03 15:47:48	taron	you've achieved the procrastinator's final form
2014-11-03 15:47:50	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-03 15:47:56	relsqui	wheezl: basically I'm harrassing zigdon in gtalk
2014-11-03 15:47:57	taron	a procrastinating nirvana of sorts
2014-11-03 15:47:57	relsqui	in hebrew
2014-11-03 15:48:01	@bajr	hmm, what's the most dice you've ever rolled and cared about the individual results?
2014-11-03 15:48:07	relsqui	"dan how do I say this and this and this other thing"
2014-11-03 15:48:21	relsqui	"wait how do I use the grammar right to ask the question I'm actually trying to ask"
2014-11-03 15:48:25	tombat	well if it's warhammer 40k it could be a lot
2014-11-03 15:48:28	relsqui	we've been doing this for like an hour and I seriously haven't gotten to my original question yet
2014-11-03 15:48:38	taron	same thing with shadowrun x_x so many d6s
2014-11-03 15:48:42	@bajr	tombat: w40k is just dice pools
2014-11-03 15:48:50	@bajr	you only care how many roll more than something
2014-11-03 15:48:57	relsqui	and none of this is directly related to homework but the practice is useful
2014-11-03 15:48:58	@bajr	(i will eventually implement dice pools)
2014-11-03 15:49:03	tombat	sometimes you care about 6s or 1s I think
2014-11-03 15:49:21	tombat	yeah I guess that makes sense
2014-11-03 15:49:22	taron	relsqui: lol, I ask my friends that sort of thing about german and get four different answers from the three of them
2014-11-03 15:49:26	zigdon	relsqui: lol, didn't know you didn't get to your question :)
2014-11-03 15:49:31	relsqui	>_>
2014-11-03 15:49:39	relsqui	zigdon: so it was actually relevant when I mentioned I had hebrew and then phonetics today
2014-11-03 15:49:46	relsqui	zigdon: btw, did I say that right?
2014-11-03 15:49:49	relsqui	fonetikah?
2014-11-03 15:49:53	relsqui	(see??? this is how I get sidetracked)
2014-11-03 15:49:59	relsqui	taron: haha excellent
2014-11-03 15:50:05	relsqui	taron: yeah sometimes the answer is "fuck if I know"
2014-11-03 15:50:26	relsqui	which reminds me, I think we agreed that a whiteboard is a luach, same as a chalkboard
2014-11-03 15:50:46	relsqui	zigdon: also I have hayaldah hachi yafah bagan stuck in my head
2014-11-03 15:50:56	relsqui	I should totally listen to that album
2014-11-03 15:51:27	taron	2/3 of them just got apprenticeships and shit instead of going to uni and the other one isn't comfortable explaining things in english x_x
2014-11-03 15:51:35	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-03 15:51:52	taron	kind of amusing watching the conversation devolve into random german shouting though
2014-11-03 15:51:53	relsqui	yeah, we have had some confusing conversations because among the vocabulary zigdon doesn't have (like, frankly, most people), is grammar jargon >_>
2014-11-03 15:51:57	relsqui	lol
2014-11-03 15:52:09	wheezl	man i'm in my sophomore inquiry class and we're in the library being taught how to research jeez i cannot believe this is needed
2014-11-03 15:52:26	relsqui	in particular hebrew has this particular kind of verb structure thing that just doesn't exist in english or any romance language afaik, and has no analogue
2014-11-03 15:52:37	relsqui	and I *encountered* it, necessarily, but I didn't understand it
2014-11-03 15:52:40	relsqui	and couldn't get an overview
2014-11-03 15:52:41	taron	oh man, those are annoying
2014-11-03 15:52:47	relsqui	it's super cool now that I get it
2014-11-03 15:52:51	relsqui	but iirc I had to google it
2014-11-03 15:52:57	relsqui	wheezl: y'know I used to make fun of those
2014-11-03 15:53:02	relsqui	wheezl: and then I realized I'm terrible at research, lol
2014-11-03 15:53:09	taron	same here -_-
2014-11-03 15:53:13	relsqui	because I don't take the kind of classes that require it
2014-11-03 15:53:22	relsqui	otoh I'm also not a sophomore, so, missed the boat I guess >_>
2014-11-03 15:53:51	taron	this is the only problem I've had so far with coming in as a junior or something or other
2014-11-03 15:53:58	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-03 15:54:36	relsqui	my hobby: drawing little cartoons in my notes to help me remember words, texting them to zigdon to make him giggle
2014-11-03 15:55:07	tombat	every time they have to tell people not to write informally
2014-11-03 15:55:28	taron	and the number of people who still fail at it is impressive
2014-11-03 15:55:46	taron	but it makes me feel better about my writing skills
2014-11-03 15:55:46	relsqui	yeah, that one I do find odd. because I don't know if there exist secondary institutions where you're not required to do that kind of codeswitching
2014-11-03 15:56:05	taron	I certainly hope not, but I wouldn't put it past the American higher education system.
2014-11-03 15:56:20	relsqui	I don't even mean higher! just, uh, medium
2014-11-03 15:56:21	relsqui	high schools
2014-11-03 15:56:29	relsqui	I'unno
2014-11-03 15:56:31	taron	or them either.
2014-11-03 15:56:43	relsqui	I'm probably missing something, though, 'cause I know I'm coming from a position of enormous privilege in this respect
2014-11-03 15:56:51	 *	wheezl shrugs at the american education system
2014-11-03 15:57:01	taron	yeah, same here
2014-11-03 15:58:29	 *	taron is still annoyed at the kid I had to deal with in 8th grade who spelled paper as "papper"
2014-11-03 15:59:40	wheezl	omg the whole class is giggling because the librarian asked for a name to look up in the research system, and someone said "bill nye the science guy"
2014-11-03 15:59:57	wheezl	and she said "/the science guy/??? never heard of him" 
2014-11-03 16:00:02	wheezl	everyone is in disbelief 
2014-11-03 16:00:49	relsqui	wat
2014-11-03 16:00:59	wheezl	ye
2014-11-03 16:01:02	tombat	somebody on the first day of calc this term sent in a post on d2l sayng that a function is "a fatty rager" and of course that was the one the teacher opened up
2014-11-03 16:01:17	tombat	and then he's all "can someone tell me what that means?
2014-11-03 16:01:18	tombat	"
2014-11-03 16:01:47	wheezl	wait i don't know that one either

2014-11-03 16:03:05	wheezl	yea that doesn't sound like a class friendly term
2014-11-03 16:03:55	dom	well a rager is just a party
2014-11-03 16:04:02	dom	well, a "party"
2014-11-03 16:04:21	dom	drink like a fish, etc
2014-11-03 16:05:01	dom	fatty denotes that it is "hoppin'" perhaps, or they might procure "fatties" (joints) there

2014-11-03 16:12:14	 *	relsqui lazy, uses dropbox
2014-11-03 16:12:29	 *	taron just deleted about 200 pictures so I could see my haircut from last year
2014-11-03 16:12:43	relsqui	XD
2014-11-03 16:14:40	taron	oh thank god it was actually in there and I don't have to harass my mom for my phone
2014-11-03 16:14:51	taron	also, apparently I tied rope lights to a ceiling fan at some point last year
2014-11-03 16:15:11	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-03 16:15:13	wheezl	taron: apparently?
2014-11-03 16:15:17	relsqui	that seems like a good idea
2014-11-03 16:15:29	taron	http://imgur.com/D7iNU57 I have no memory of this happening
2014-11-03 16:15:30	link-bot	imgur: the simple image sharer (http://goo.gl/QU1FeQ)
2014-11-03 16:16:54	taron	http://i.imgur.com/ZR3C5NS.jpg this is also making me realize just how bad my procrastination is >_>
2014-11-03 16:19:20	relsqui	ooh
2014-11-03 16:19:26	relsqui	that++
2014-11-03 16:20:51	taron	also found in my imgur: pictures of a random cow statue in eastern oregon, severely deformed crescent rolls, and some really bad german jokes
2014-11-03 16:23:25	taron	ooh, and a jägermeister tree
2014-11-03 16:25:55	relsqui	haha
2014-11-03 16:27:23	taron	but yeah haven't done shit with it since that picture was taken >_> I'm totally on top of things I swear
2014-11-03 16:29:18	relsqui	you could hawk it. curly mohawks own.
2014-11-03 16:29:45	relsqui	oh, also -- mancat might has guards you can use. not offering on his behalf but he mentioned it
2014-11-03 16:29:48	relsqui	so worth investigating
2014-11-03 16:30:17	taron	it's tempting, miya keeps saying I could pull one off, and it'll piss my mother off
2014-11-03 16:30:25	relsqui	haha
2014-11-03 16:30:27	relsqui	all good reasons
2014-11-03 16:31:40	taron	and suddenly I realize I have neither the motivation to go to class nor the motivation to go to bishops
2014-11-03 16:31:43	taron	dammit
2014-11-03 16:32:11	relsqui	you should go to class. but if you don't go to class you should come down here >_>
2014-11-03 16:32:25	taron	it's critical thinking, if it were anything else I might actually care
2014-11-03 16:32:26	relsqui	actually I won't try to bait you down to the cat because I'm only going to be here another hour or so myself
2014-11-03 16:32:32	taron	lol
2014-11-03 16:32:37	relsqui	and that would be mean
2014-11-03 16:32:41	relsqui	although you're welcome to come to magic ofc
2014-11-03 16:33:11	taron	I'll keep trying to motivate myself to actually go do /something/ and with any luck when magic's over I'll show up at the cat with a shiny new haircut
2014-11-03 16:33:47	relsqui	:D
2014-11-03 16:34:13	tombat	I wish I weren't in this dumb public speaking class so I could come to mtg at the beginning

2014-11-03 16:41:00	relsqui	man, the oregon voter's guide is way different from the california one

2014-11-03 16:48:42	relsqui	I think it's really important to have a system whereby that's possible, but I don't personally want to do it
2014-11-03 16:48:51	tombat	muh stickers
2014-11-03 16:49:08	relsqui	right?
2014-11-03 16:49:10	taron	agreed, though I'm the opposite and prefer not wasting time standing in line
2014-11-03 16:49:10	relsqui	for that among other reasons
2014-11-03 16:49:23	relsqui	maybe I'm spoiled, have rarely had that problem

2014-11-03 16:49:53	taron	nah, the precinct on campus at OSU was always crowded as hell because the students all got funneled through there

2014-11-03 17:01:25	hylleddin	How does the mail-in thing work with the deadlines? Is it just if it's mailed by Tuesday? Or do they have to recieve it by Tuesday?
2014-11-03 17:01:37	tombat	relsqui: yeah that's pretty weird. I wonder if there's a screening process?
2014-11-03 17:02:00	tombat	hylleddin: you should go to a drop-off box
2014-11-03 17:02:31	tombat	hylleddin: they won't get it in time if you mail it
2014-11-03 17:02:45	taron	I feel like if they screened them someone'd call it a violation of the first amendment real fast.
2014-11-03 17:02:58	hylleddin	Thanks tombat++.
2014-11-03 17:03:00	relsqui	yeah, in practice, but there's gotta be a way to do it sanely
2014-11-03 17:03:01	 *	relsqui sighs
2014-11-03 17:04:19	hylleddin	Seems like they have to screen them somewhat, to avoid the booklet looking like internet comments.
2014-11-03 17:05:27	relsqui	yeah
2014-11-03 17:16:24	tombat	how much would I actually miss public speaking if I ditched? I mean really?
2014-11-03 17:17:18	hylleddin	Do they take attendance?
2014-11-03 17:17:52	tombat	yeah...
2014-11-03 17:18:09	tombat	maybe I could just sneak out partway through since it starts at 6:30
2014-11-03 17:18:36	tombat	not the class, the mtg stuff

2014-11-03 21:59:12	askore	I was missing like half the spices because I didn't write them down before I went to the store

2014-11-03 21:59:17	askore	but it was still good

2014-11-03 22:00:00	askore	taron: cs people that could possibly help over irc are awake now and are probably not awake in the morning?
2014-11-03 22:00:11	askore	wait that's an excuse for, not against
2014-11-03 22:00:14	askore	hmm
2014-11-03 22:00:19	tamgc	(oh...misparsed as looking for an excuse not to do homework tomorrow...not *for* tomorrow >.>)
2014-11-03 22:00:28	taron	lol yeah...
2014-11-03 22:00:54	taron	I went and thought "oh I can totally get a haircut today" and then came back and remembered I have an advising appointment and very little free time tomorrow
2014-11-03 22:00:59	tamgc	sleep will help you absorb the material in class better >.> <.<
2014-11-03 22:01:14	taron	midterm tomorrow x_x
2014-11-03 22:01:23	taron	but it's CS162, so I'm really not concerned
2014-11-03 22:01:45	tamgc	sleep will help you perform better on the midterm >.>
2014-11-03 22:02:26	taron	oh god, now I'm actually feeling somewhat convinced I should sleep instead
2014-11-03 22:02:56	tamgc	health is important <.< rest is good
2014-11-03 22:03:37	taron	;_;
2014-11-03 22:03:39	tamgc	the value of midterm is greater than value of homework (maybe...not sure)
2014-11-03 22:03:59	tamgc	ok, I'm done being a bad influence
2014-11-03 22:04:07	tamgc	(for now)
2014-11-03 22:05:05	taron	lol
2014-11-03 22:07:27	askore	otoh it's true? usually you can do late work/partial credit for homework but not exams
2014-11-03 22:08:30	taron	except it's already late, or else I wouldn't be worrying about it in the first place since it's only 5% off.
2014-11-03 22:08:57	askore	ahh yeah
2014-11-03 22:10:27	taron	man I really want to just use strtok for this but that's beyond the scope of the class so far
2014-11-03 22:11:02	askore	what class?
2014-11-03 22:11:06	taron	CS162
2014-11-03 22:11:30	askore	using strtok is definitely acceptable
2014-11-03 22:11:35	askore	I mean in general
2014-11-03 22:11:51	askore	karla usually does an assignment in 162 that requires you to use that or like, strstr or something
2014-11-03 22:12:14	taron	hrm, she keeps telling us not to google anything and to just go off the notes
2014-11-03 22:12:23	taron	but I suppose no one will be paying that much attention
2014-11-03 22:12:37	askore	mmmmmm
2014-11-03 22:22:45	taron	fuck it, making tea and playing games instead.
2014-11-03 22:22:45	relsqui	yeah, she says that and then she doesn't teach you all of the cstring library >_>
2014-11-03 22:22:53	taron	yeah pretty much
2014-11-03 22:23:15	taron	which I understand for everyone else, but for me coming from python which has fancier ways of doing all this it's just infuriating
2014-11-03 22:23:46	relsqui	yeah, actually a lot of people have that problem in 162
2014-11-03 22:23:54	relsqui	because 161 is sometimes taught in python
2014-11-03 22:24:05	relsqui	so people learn to code for the first time in python and then get dropped in karla's 162 and are like p____q
2014-11-03 22:24:08	relsqui	see e.g. Golem
2014-11-03 22:24:32	taron	I'm trying to be glad I'm not doing it in C or in x86 ASM instead, but it's not really working >_>
2014-11-03 22:24:59	 *	taron hates string manipulation in any language
2014-11-03 22:29:43	relsqui	XD
2014-11-03 22:29:55	relsqui	just ... just don't even think of it as strings
2014-11-03 22:30:03	relsqui	you're practicing array syntax and memory management'
2014-11-03 22:30:06	relsqui	that's what's important :P
2014-11-03 22:30:11	taron	pretty much x_x
2014-11-03 22:30:45	taron	anyway, fuck the whole thing, i'm going to sit and fuck around for an hour or so and enjoy the new haircut.

2014-11-03 22:38:33	@bajr	also, for the record, holy shit "The Man From Nowhere" is a trip of a movie
2014-11-03 22:38:39	relsqui	yeah?
2014-11-03 22:39:38	@bajr	The choreography and writing are really good, actors are pretty decent, but it's kinda the Game of Thrones of Korean film
2014-11-03 22:39:58	relsqui	I see.
2014-11-03 22:41:37	@bajr	I strongly recommend it if you're in the mood for some feels-heavy fucked up shit
2014-11-03 22:42:09	taron	http://i.imgur.com/9JefjxR.jpg as usual it is already attempting to flop in every possible direction except where intended

2014-11-03 22:45:29	relsqui	haha, cool
2014-11-03 22:45:32	relsqui	I think that still counts as helping
2014-11-03 22:45:49	taron	lol I probably wouldn't have had the motivation to get up and do something otherwise

2014-11-05 08:58:15	@bajr	the programmer jams his code into that socket roughly and angrily after preparing a package to send through it
2014-11-05 08:58:21	tamgc	heh mancat++ bajr++

2014-11-05 08:59:06	karmabot	Done, tamgc.
2014-11-05 08:59:10	tamgc	=P
2014-11-05 09:00:34	@bajr	if the programmer cares about the safety and usefulness of that socket, they'll protect themselves from accidental trojans and nasty virus by wrapping up with SSL
2014-11-05 09:01:05	@bajr	and nobody uses protection their first time
2014-11-05 09:02:18	@bajr	and that's how irc get pragnent
2014-11-05 09:02:21	 *	bajr nods sagely

2014-11-05 10:02:25	relsqui	iirc it's the most common color distinction for other languages not to have that english does

2014-11-05 12:05:13	hylleddin	relsqui: Do you know of any work done on the linguistics of mathematical notation?
2014-11-05 12:07:28	relsqui	not offhand. did you have a particular topic in mind?
2014-11-05 12:07:39	relsqui	it's kind of a very different animal when the encoding is invented by people out of whole cloth
2014-11-05 12:09:27	hylleddin	I was just doing some math and realized that the meanings of a lot of these symbols are heavily context dependent.
2014-11-05 12:09:42	relsqui	huh. what size of context? if you follow
2014-11-05 12:09:51	relsqui	like, position within the "phrase" or, like, what subject you're doing
2014-11-05 12:10:27	hylleddin	Both.
2014-11-05 12:10:51	hylleddin	(The particular example that got me thinking about it is more subject size)
2014-11-05 12:10:52	jesusaurus	hylleddin: example?
2014-11-05 12:11:33	relsqui	yeah, examples of the latter aren't too hard, see all of greek
2014-11-05 12:11:39	relsqui	also, x-bar

2014-11-05 12:11:45	relsqui	:P
2014-11-05 12:11:55	hylleddin	Well, I'm trying to figure out what calligraphic R means in a particular functional analysis text book.
2014-11-05 12:12:02	jesusaurus	(x-bar)+-
2014-11-05 12:12:13	relsqui	haha
2014-11-05 12:12:18	hylleddin	I don't know if it's a general functional analysis notation or just textbook local.
2014-11-05 12:12:28	jesusaurus	is it not just the set of real numbers?
2014-11-05 12:12:40	hylleddin	That's blackboard bold R.
2014-11-05 12:12:55	relsqui	(having names for symbols)++
2014-11-05 12:13:00	jesusaurus	ive seen it be both
2014-11-05 12:13:25	hylleddin	Huh, I've never seen calligraphic stuff used for sets.
2014-11-05 12:13:32	hylleddin	Though I have seen it used for collections.
2014-11-05 12:14:22	hylleddin	And I think some ways of defining the real numbers basically look at them as collections.
2014-11-05 12:15:37	hylleddin	(This is another linguistics of math thing I was thinking about. How symbol stylization helps define context)
2014-11-05 12:16:58	hylleddin	Attempting to google math and linguistics just comes up with mathematical linguistics.
2014-11-05 12:17:06	hylleddin	Which is the opposite of what I want.
2014-11-05 12:18:02	relsqui	haha
2014-11-05 12:21:26	hylleddin	OK, apparently calligraphic R means the range of a function in this book.
2014-11-05 12:21:45	hylleddin	Symbols are listed in the index, which is quite convienient.
2014-11-05 12:24:59	tamgc	that++

2014-11-05 13:19:57	tamgc	mgood has some fun stuff in his github, so still worth poking around his repos anyways

2014-11-05 15:19:31	Golem	dom: can I be a half elf?  The party seems to have no defender, and I like the idea of a half blood elf half human paladin whos faction loyalty is ambiguous
2014-11-05 15:23:44	jesusaurus	theres a new party starting up? when?
2014-11-05 15:24:09	 *	jesusaurus is tempted to start a shadowrun campaign once fully situated in pdx
2014-11-05 15:24:28	 *	Fox thinks whatever game this is needs more kobolds.

2014-11-05 15:25:17	jesusaurus	i played a kuo-toa cleric named gloolp once. that was fun :)

2014-11-05 15:38:55	hylleddin	(Time permitting, as always.)
2014-11-05 15:39:02	taron	I'll bring my full stack of rulebooks up from Corvallis and shit.
2014-11-05 15:39:19	hylleddin	5th Ed?
2014-11-05 15:39:51	Golem	jesusaurus: I would love to play shadowrun.  Although I still dont know why armor in that game makes you easier to kill
2014-11-05 15:39:59	 *	taron nearly got a special Origins edition one but kept getting to the convention center late
2014-11-05 15:40:18	taron	COTA--

2014-11-05 15:42:19	@bajr	jesusaurus: I'm in
2014-11-05 15:42:31	hylleddin	Cool. I'm only familiar with 4th Ed.
2014-11-05 15:42:31	@bajr	(if you're not full up already)
2014-11-05 15:50:03	tamgc	(so... kuo-toas are essentially murlocs?)
2014-11-05 15:50:48	tamgc	or vice versa to be more accurate
2014-11-05 15:51:48	jesusaurus	tamgc: ooh, that would be super useful, all i have are some pdfs, what ed?
2014-11-05 15:51:58	jesusaurus	oh, like all of them?
2014-11-05 15:52:21	tamgc	ta<tab><tab><tab> =P
2014-11-05 15:52:25	taron	lol
2014-11-05 15:52:29	taron	was wondering about that
2014-11-05 15:52:52	jesusaurus	oh lol
2014-11-05 15:53:02	taron	I've got physical copies of each core from 1-3 and the 20th anniversary edition, along with a bunch of 2/3/4ed supplements but I can't remember which off the top of my head
2014-11-05 15:53:12	tamgc	(heh, and all 3 "ta" names are 5 letters...)
2014-11-05 15:53:16	taron	my parents are coming up this weekend so I'll have my dad grab them
2014-11-05 15:54:23	 *	tamgc would be interested in joining and/or watching to at least see the system
2014-11-05 15:54:33	jesusaurus	i havent actually played a whole lot of shadowrun, but ive been told 3rd ed is the best
2014-11-05 15:55:06	tamgc	must be some RPG rule that 3.x versions are the 'best' heh
2014-11-05 15:55:13	taron	dunno how 5th compares to 3rd, but I know a lot of the people who've been playing for a while liked 3rd better than 4th
2014-11-05 15:55:21	taron	4th is supposed to be easier to learn though?
2014-11-05 15:55:41	taron	at least as long as you're playing the 20th anniversary edition instead of the clusterfuck that was the original 4e rulebook
2014-11-05 15:55:41	jesusaurus	so, similar to d&d
2014-11-05 15:55:44	taron	p much
2014-11-05 16:03:25	Golem	I liked 4th better than 3rd, or even 3.x for the most part.  Mind you, they ruined 4e pretty hard.  
2014-11-05 16:03:38	Golem	So you kinda have to pick your way through the dross of the later books
2014-11-05 16:03:58	Golem	but I dont think they are really compareable
2014-11-05 16:04:15	Golem	3.x is like a sandbox rpg, and 4th is like a sandbox action game
2014-11-05 16:04:52	Golem	with strategy elements
2014-11-05 16:07:14	 *	Takua shows up late to the party to perk ears
2014-11-05 16:07:52	askore	all the ears seem to be perked now
2014-11-05 16:07:55	Fox	I have no opinion on 4e D&D, since I never touched it.
2014-11-05 16:08:13	Fox	I was watching the 5th edition playtest at Guardian Games and I had my hands on my head whenever I looked at the character sheets.
2014-11-05 16:08:43	Golem	very well balanced, focused around teamwork and round by round strategy.  
2014-11-05 16:08:43	Takua	lol
2014-11-05 16:09:10	Golem	On the other hand, lost a bit of the sandboxing and in-class differances
2014-11-05 16:09:43	Fox	I was looking for a skill rank system, or for feats, and I saw multi-classing was handled by "hybrid" characters.
2014-11-05 16:09:47	Fox	It was like culture shock. :P
2014-11-05 16:10:12	Golem	its very strange
2014-11-05 16:10:29	Golem	but I like enough of what they did with 5e that I will likely give it a try if I have a chance
2014-11-05 16:10:57	Fox	I don't think I'd try it for another 2 years or so, just because I expect that's how long the game I'm running will continue going.
2014-11-05 16:11:07	Golem	ayup
2014-11-05 16:11:47	 *	Fox is busy congratulating one of his players on hitting monk 7 and another on reaching barbarian 2/oracle 6.
2014-11-05 16:12:02	Fox	heh
2014-11-05 16:12:25	Golem	wow, a monk survived to level 7!
2014-11-05 16:12:38	Golem	^_^
2014-11-05 16:13:08	Fox	It's a mythic game, so the full class breakdown is... monk 7/guardian 3, and barbarian 2/oracle 6/hierophant 3
2014-11-05 16:13:19	Golem	ahhh
2014-11-05 16:13:20	Fox	It's pretty hard to kill a mythic monk. ;x
2014-11-05 16:13:27	Golem	seems like it would be
2014-11-05 16:14:01	Fox	He has Display of Wisdom and I sometimes have to make up Perception DCs for him, because he has Skill Focus and Alertness, too, and can occasionally roll beyond +40 and pinpoint invisible creatures.
2014-11-05 16:14:05	Fox	^_^;
2014-11-05 16:14:29	Golem	nice
2014-11-05 16:15:00	Fox	He also has higher Spellcraft than anyone else...
2014-11-05 16:15:06	 *	Fox rubs temples.
2014-11-05 16:15:20	Golem	....why does he have spellcraft at all?
2014-11-05 16:15:49	Fox	The character is an ex-wizard who took up ascetism as an alternative route to enlightenment instead of the arcane.
2014-11-05 16:15:59	Golem	ahh
2014-11-05 16:16:00	Fox	And he tries to learn magic so he can better fight it.
2014-11-05 16:17:07	tamgc	oh hey...lunch is a thing...
2014-11-05 16:17:08	Golem	well at least there is a reason
2014-11-05 16:17:15	Fox	Go eat, tamgc.
2014-11-05 16:17:42	tamgc	yeah, just been caught up with things here and there...and just looked at clock -.-
2014-11-05 16:18:45	Fox	I have a human fighter 8/guardian 3, a dragonwrought kobold barbarian 2/oracle 6/hierophant 3, a human fighter 5/paladin 2/champion 2, a kitsune gunslinger 1/cleric 6/marshal 2, and then said monk.
2014-11-05 16:19:14	Fox	I think. I'd have to double check... I don't look at their character sheets often (I take an effort not to know what my players can do so it doesn't factor into encounters).
2014-11-05 16:49:50	relsqui	karmabot: join #wednesdaysession
2014-11-05 16:49:50	karmabot	Sure, relsqui.
2014-11-05 16:53:04	Pash	Fox that's so many classes I don't even
2014-11-05 16:53:17	Pash	I literally don't even
2014-11-05 17:14:14	hylleddin	Holy crap, we're actually talking about tabletop games in here.
2014-11-05 17:14:57	Pash	 it'd all lies, don't you even
2014-11-05 17:15:37	 *	Takua should probably play a tabletop game that lasts past two sessions again at some point
2014-11-05 17:16:04	Pash	nonsense
2014-11-05 17:20:48	dom	Golem: yes
2014-11-05 17:21:16	askore	hear hear takua
2014-11-05 17:22:54	Pash	hylleddin: we only gossip about tabletop games in here
2014-11-05 17:23:32	Pash	like this one time, a really pretty game liked me back, and now we're an item :3
2014-11-05 17:32:59	Pash	you should meet my 4e, she's the prettiest girl at the ball
2014-11-05 17:33:56	Takua	Sadly, I've spent more time worldbuilding for campaigns that never existed then I've ever spent actually playing
2014-11-05 17:34:12	Pash	Takua: "sadly"
2014-11-05 17:34:52	Takua	Well it's all well and good to run it through your head like a movie or something, and it's a completely different thing to make it a sandbox and turn your cohort lose in it
2014-11-05 17:35:09	Takua	One's a script, the other is living
2014-11-05 17:36:56	taron	I find worldbuilding more fun personally, but that might just be me.
2014-11-05 17:38:00	Takua	Oh it's a blast.  I mean, I write for fun, I know the value and joy of worldbuilding, and the glory of controlling the plot in your own two hands the fucking amazing things you can do with it
2014-11-05 17:38:28	Takua	But sometimes you need to mix up another mind or two...and watch as they come up with things you haven't considered
2014-11-05 17:38:42	Pash	.kek
2014-11-05 17:38:44	Takua	Or, you know, hopelessly fail and let the darkness wash over your world
2014-11-05 17:40:49	Pash	which I like to do every third year or so
2014-11-05 17:41:01	taron	Fair enough. Either way, I haven't had the time or energy to do anything in a while.
2014-11-05 17:41:49	Pash	every third week or so I bring up a world, and inflict darkness on it
2014-11-05 17:42:00	Pash	I'm maybe an ass
2014-11-05 17:42:05	wheezl	sounds tedious, you should make a bot for that
2014-11-05 17:42:12	Pash	good idea
2014-11-05 17:42:29	wheezl	take the effort out of inflicting darkness
2014-11-05 17:42:42	wheezl	i'm picturing full automation here
2014-11-05 17:42:54	Pash	bot: when happy = 1, execute Darkness()
2014-11-05 17:42:59	wheezl	pretty much
2014-11-05 17:43:44	wheezl	like someone could type 
2014-11-05 17:43:47	 *	wheezl is happy
2014-11-05 17:44:00	wheezl	and then darknessbot is there to inflict darkness
2014-11-05 17:44:20	wheezl	shut down the happy train before it goes to farr
2014-11-05 17:44:29	Golem	dom: sweet.  Now all I need is access to the charecter builder floating around somewhere
2014-11-05 17:44:46	Pash	Golem: stop being on mac
2014-11-05 17:45:10	Pash	it only makes a sad
2014-11-05 17:45:26	Golem	I refuse, for macs are good computer
2014-11-05 17:45:31	hylleddin	Bah, you need a need something with a soul to know how to inflict proper evil. :P
2014-11-05 17:45:58	taron	Welp, can't learn from me then.
2014-11-05 17:46:11	Pash	hylleddin: I refuse to get a soul.  That's the big, hip thing now, and I'm so underground
2014-11-05 17:46:32	hylleddin	(Actually, there was an interesting paper in Machine Learning class about trying to detect whether movie reviews are positive)
2014-11-05 17:47:00	hylleddin	Same principle could be applied to IRC chat and happiness.
2014-11-05 17:47:11	hylleddin	But getting training data would be hard.
2014-11-05 17:48:01	hylleddin	I doubt you want to spend $3000 on mechanical turk workers.
2014-11-05 17:48:07	Pash	anyway, I'm nominally supposed to be paying attention to kittens
2014-11-05 17:48:24	wheezl	don't forget to herd those kittents

2014-11-05 17:49:43	Pash	he's SO FAT
2014-11-05 17:49:47	wheezl	there should be an irl office cat

2014-11-05 17:50:47	hylleddin	I APPROVE of getting an IRL office cat.
2014-11-05 17:50:57	Golem	its not allowed, school regs
2014-11-05 17:51:01	hylleddin	I miss having cats around.

2014-11-05 17:51:27	Golem	yeah, I was sad too -_-
2014-11-05 17:51:38	wheezl	brb gotta walk home

2014-11-05 17:52:43	Pash	all are welcome to come bug my cat
2014-11-05 17:53:05	Pash	I mean, not tonight, because I'm not home, but anytime else
2014-11-05 17:53:54	taron	I may have to take you up on that at some point, I miss being around animals.
2014-11-05 17:54:16	Pash	do it! and bring everyone!
2014-11-05 17:54:47	taron	it'll be a cat party, figuratively and literally

2014-11-05 19:00:32	Fox	Pash: Not all of those were classes. In Pathfinder, there's a ruleset for playing "Mythic" games; it's just a higher power level of Pathfinder. Players gain the ability to do weird things like add 1d6 to the result of a roll and change its results after they happen. Automatically stabilize under 0 hit points. Regrow lost limbs with a night's sleep. etc.
2014-11-05 19:00:46	 *	Fox accidentally short expo
2014-11-05 19:18:07	Golem	I have heard that the 4e charecter builder is on the network somewhere.  Can somoene point me at it?
2014-11-05 19:18:36	dom	mmm there was a website tombat had last week
2014-11-05 19:18:43	dom	^ tombat show golem your link
2014-11-05 19:19:09	Golem	bleh, if its the linux one I dont want it.  It doesnt calculate powers right and it doesnt have the options I want
2014-11-05 19:19:17	dom	no, its online
2014-11-05 19:19:27	dom	its an online sheet
2014-11-05 19:19:40	Golem	not linux, java -_-
2014-11-05 19:19:45	Golem	sorry not sure where my brain was going
2014-11-05 19:19:50	dom	idk?
2014-11-05 19:19:53	dom	I didn't use it
2014-11-05 19:20:07	Golem	OK
2014-11-05 19:20:10	Golem	ill look it up then
2014-11-05 19:33:48	Golem	dom: did you give us any free feats?  I vaugely recall something about giving everyone expertise
2014-11-05 19:36:25	dom	have not mentioned anything of the sort
2014-11-05 19:36:38	dom	your race might have to be switched around on paper
2014-11-05 19:36:44	dom	to get a tauren
2014-11-05 19:36:54	Golem	Why a tauren?  are we all horde?
2014-11-05 19:37:31	dom	no, I re-read what you said
2014-11-05 19:37:40	dom	OK you wanted to be a half-elf instead
2014-11-05 19:37:45	dom	mmmmm
2014-11-05 19:37:53	dom	I'll check it tomorrow when you bring it in
2014-11-05 19:37:57	dom	probably will be fine
2014-11-05 19:38:10	dom	horde/alliance not a factor in this campaign
2014-11-05 19:38:18	dom	as none of the PCs are too attached
2014-11-05 19:38:37	Golem	kk
2014-11-05 19:38:57	Golem	yeah there was precedent in the lore for half-elves and it seems like we needed a tank so I thought I would play a proper paladin ^_^
2014-11-05 19:39:16	dom	sure
2014-11-05 19:39:21	Golem	any themes allowed?
2014-11-05 19:39:26	dom	themes?
2014-11-05 19:39:31	Golem	good, that would be a no
2014-11-05 19:39:36	dom	you have to have a reason for being left behind
2014-11-05 19:39:41	dom	in wpl/epl
2014-11-05 19:39:43	Golem	ahhh
2014-11-05 19:39:53	dom	argent crusade left to go fight in northrend
2014-11-05 19:39:58	dom	why are you not there
2014-11-05 19:40:00	dom	etc
2014-11-05 19:40:24	dom	thats more a personality thing though
2014-11-05 19:40:28	Golem	Just got back from outland, where I followed an adventurer who decided it would be better to return home.  That took a while.  Or something to that effect
2014-11-05 19:40:38	Golem	themes are actually like free abilities you can get from backgrounds
2014-11-05 19:40:54	Golem	the guardian theme lets you get a power where you take damage for someone else, for example
2014-11-05 19:41:03	Golem	they are fun, but only if everyone has them
2014-11-05 19:41:15	dom	no, no one has that
2014-11-05 19:41:20	Golem	yar
2014-11-05 19:41:24	wheezl	yarp
2014-11-05 19:41:25	Golem	wont worry about it then
2014-11-05 19:41:38	dom	just getting back to outland wouldn't cut it imo
2014-11-05 19:41:42	dom	back from
2014-11-05 19:42:22	dom	as a paladin in that area, you'd have to be at least tangentially with the argent crusade
2014-11-05 19:42:31	dom	you'd be sent there if they had reason to
2014-11-05 19:43:05	dom	for example, one of the npcs can
2014-11-05 19:43:11	Golem	Well, I could just be an adventuring paladin unrelated to the crusade
2014-11-05 19:43:13	dom	't go to northrend because he's a drunk
2014-11-05 19:43:22	dom	then why are you in wpl?
2014-11-05 19:43:25	Golem	or I could have gone there looking for them without realizing that they were not there anymore
2014-11-05 19:43:43	dom	k, make up some kind of story and run it by me
2014-11-05 19:43:50	Golem	I will think on it and get back to you
2014-11-05 19:44:04	dom	remember that the northrend war has been going on for like 2 years now
2014-11-05 19:44:14	Golem	Ahh
2014-11-05 19:44:16	dom	you would know where the argent crusade was
2014-11-05 19:44:21	Golem	kk
2014-11-05 19:44:27	dom	and if you were looking to fight the scourge, you'd have gone to northrend
2014-11-05 19:44:35	Golem	Has arthas been taken down yet?  I feel like you mentioned we were between the two
2014-11-05 19:44:46	Golem	Wrath and Cata
2014-11-05 19:44:58	dom	arthas is dead, none of the player characters or argent crusade members in wpl/epl know
2014-11-05 19:45:03	Golem	right then
2014-11-05 19:45:06	dom	kelthuzad and the crimson scourge know
2014-11-05 19:45:10	dom	but they aint talking to you
2014-11-05 19:45:27	Golem	he was probably living in silvermoon, and I wasnt a paladin until recently when my ability manifested in a ghoul attack
2014-11-05 19:45:48	dom	it'd be more likely an amani attack
2014-11-05 19:45:57	Golem	mm true
2014-11-05 19:46:03	dom	the scourge has shrunk down to only the plaguelands after kt left
2014-11-05 19:46:10	Golem	kk
2014-11-05 19:46:13	Golem	amani attack then
2014-11-05 19:46:19	dom	now that he has returned (like days before the story starts) the scourge would go for smc
2014-11-05 19:47:09	Golem	Wherein there were like, you are a paladin, and a half-elf, and therefore you will go scout these returning scourge for us because we dont entirely trust you
2014-11-05 19:47:33	dom	"you dont belong here cuz u r not elf kek:
2014-11-05 19:47:34	dom	"
2014-11-05 19:48:03	Golem	And he is a paladin to boot, which means he was likely shipped off to study with the former blood knights when he started throwing light around
2014-11-05 19:48:12	dom	yup

2014-11-06 10:39:09	relsqui	there's a hat of data structures
2014-11-06 10:39:15	relsqui	and a hat of themes/concepts for a program
2014-11-06 10:39:20	relsqui	...
2014-11-06 10:39:23	relsqui	I'll let you infer the rest
2014-11-06 10:40:00	jesusaurus	its kinda like data structures are a toolbelt of utilities to use in solving problems
2014-11-06 10:40:08	relsqui	jesusaurus: oh, sure
2014-11-06 10:40:15	relsqui	which is awesome, and nesting them weirdly is also awesome when it solves the problem
2014-11-06 10:40:19	jesusaurus	sometimes you need a circular linked list, and sometimes you need a hashmap
2014-11-06 10:40:27	relsqui	but I get a little :| when there's no relationship between the assigned structures and the assigned task
2014-11-06 10:51:17	taron	basically sounds like the last data structure class I took.
2014-11-06 10:51:56	taron	implement natural numbers using a stack, implement stacks using queues, etc.
2014-11-06 10:55:03	taron	oh man after this class I'm never going to forget the "segfault core dump bus error" thing
2014-11-06 10:55:36	relsqui	hahaha

2014-11-06 10:56:04	karmabot	Affirmative, relsqui.
2014-11-06 10:56:18	relsqui	like, I'm not sure I've even literally heard her say it, it's just sufficiently obviously something she would say
2014-11-06 10:56:24	taron	heh, beat me to it
2014-11-06 10:56:30	taron	and she's said it three times today at least
2014-11-06 10:56:36	relsqui	hahaha
2014-11-06 10:57:47	taron	more if you count the times she's said it in a different order

2014-11-06 13:08:47	relsqui	you could pull off historian
2014-11-06 13:08:51	taron	or unpronounceable

2014-11-06 13:43:25	tamgc	"hylleddin" seems more pokemon than historian, but that's prob because I have no idea what "hylleddin" is -.-
2014-11-06 13:46:32	relsqui	hylleddin is hylleddin 
2014-11-06 13:46:37	relsqui	and I can see the name being either, honestly
2014-11-06 13:46:46	relsqui	a little too fantastical for a pharmaceutical
2014-11-06 13:47:40	taron	forgot I hadn't finished my prelab >_> actually leaving now, but every time I see hylleddin I think of hydaelyn from FFXIV

2014-11-06 15:36:13	hylleddin	I dunno, for most games with a story, I'm there for the cutscenes.
2014-11-06 15:36:28	hylleddin	Cause the gameplay usually kind of sucks.
2014-11-06 15:36:51	taron	I watched them the first time around but not so much now.
2014-11-06 15:37:07	taron	I've also been playing since the 2nd or 3rd phase of closed beta, so... :/
2014-11-06 15:38:00	tamgc	that makes more sense heh
2014-11-06 15:38:37	hylleddin	Yeah, I guess watching them would get pretty old.
2014-11-06 15:38:51	hylleddin	(I don't repeat games often enough to run into that much.)
2014-11-06 15:44:24	taron	the main thing is that some of the cutscenes just have very strange dialogue which I don't enjoy listening to

2014-11-06 15:49:05	taron	and it's pretty much the same for limsa lominsa and ul'dah as well, carts or boats, get attacked, awkward speech from the narrator

2014-11-07 16:20:58	relsqui	if it makes you feel better it's not very good
2014-11-07 16:21:44	@dom	taron: show up to syndicat meeting 2 weeks from 21 minutes ago

2014-11-07 16:23:21	taron	relsqui: any caffeine > no caffeine
2014-11-07 16:23:39	relsqui	true.
2014-11-07 16:23:51	taron	also yay for finding out less than a week before I'm supposed to register for classes that none of the transcripts I had OSU send went through
2014-11-07 16:23:57	relsqui	>:|
2014-11-07 16:24:04	@dom	>:|
2014-11-07 16:24:18	taron	also immunization records mean I have two holds now, and I don't have access to those -_-
2014-11-07 16:24:35	nightfly	:(
2014-11-07 16:24:44	tamgc	-.-
2014-11-07 16:25:04	taron	going to be making so many angry phone calls on monday
2014-11-07 16:41:02	relsqui	taron: 1/4 done with neverclick wonder x_x
2014-11-07 16:41:51	taron	relsqui: serious respect for that.
2014-11-07 16:54:10	relsqui	trying to see if I can establish resource equilibrium with 2000 laborers @_@
2014-11-07 16:54:41	taron	I tried something like that but ended up giving up x_x but I tend not to like resource management so that's not really surprising
2014-11-07 16:54:58	taron	also someone remind me which floor of FAB that cafe is on
2014-11-07 16:55:08	@dom	1st

2014-11-07 16:55:38	taron	only way I'm staying awake through the dog meeting, let alone the braindump
2014-11-07 16:56:00	@dom	do you wanna shotgun some rockstars with me?
2014-11-07 16:56:31	taron	heh, wish I could handle that much caffeine
2014-11-07 16:56:37	taron	if I could I totally would
2014-11-07 16:56:55	tamgc	taron: first/plaza
2014-11-07 16:57:12	tamgc	I think there are monsters in the stash too
2014-11-07 16:57:27	@dom	nobody ever wants to shotgun rockstars with me

2014-11-07 16:59:01	relsqui	gonna be not at keys, but I'll stick a thing in the door
2014-11-07 16:59:40	tamgc	dom: the problem is, it's rockstars =P
2014-11-07 16:59:57	@dom	tamgc: the problem is that people drink nomral flavor rockstars
2014-11-07 17:00:05	@dom	theres only good flavor, and it isn't the main one
2014-11-07 17:00:08	 *	tamgc keeps a stash of 5 hr energy at his desk in UTS too if that's ever needed
2014-11-07 17:00:39	relsqui	haha good to know
2014-11-07 17:00:46	relsqui	tamgc: .... I don't think I knew you worked over there <_<
2014-11-07 17:01:38	tamgc	that's where most of the backend OITians are
2014-11-07 17:01:44	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-07 17:01:48	tamgc	ARC and IO is still in FAB90 though
2014-11-07 17:02:05	tamgc	but 83/84 used to be OIT space and moved to UTS
2014-11-07 17:42:47	taron	dom: acquire one and I shall attempt to consume it on the weekend, but not when I still have to function for the rest of the day >_>
2014-11-07 17:42:57	taron	hell just tell me which flavor
2014-11-07 18:02:26	taron	holy shit dhl isn't being terrible for once!
2014-11-07 18:03:20	nightfly	I've had good luck with them when getting stuff from Europe
2014-11-07 18:04:49	taron	last time my best friend mailed me something via deutsche post it never actually said it was in the US until I spontaneously got a postcard saying "hey come pick your shit up at the post office before we ship it back"
2014-11-07 18:05:05	taron	and that took nearly a month
2014-11-07 18:05:17	taron	this time I already have a USPS tracking number for a package shipped Monday though
2014-11-07 18:23:33	@dom	taron: punched flavor
2014-11-07 18:23:39	@dom	its fruit punch flavored energy drink
2014-11-07 18:24:08	taron	I shall attempt to procure some next time I go to the store
2014-11-07 18:35:28	@dom	dont bother trying at a grocery store
2014-11-07 18:35:38	@dom	go to a convenience store
2014-11-07 18:35:40	@dom	they sell that shit
2014-11-07 18:36:05	@dom	honest to god, its the energy drink I drink for the flavor
2014-11-07 18:41:00	relsqui	taron: halfway!!
2014-11-07 18:42:06	taron	relsqui: indeed! to be fair, it's still in Germany, but it's good enough for government work
2014-11-07 18:42:14	taron	now I just need to find somewhere to wear the skirts
2014-11-07 18:42:27	taron	granted this is all assuming they fit in the first place
2014-11-07 18:55:16	relsqui	I actually hadn't read scrollback yet but that's even better 8)
2014-11-07 18:55:18	 *	relsqui meant the wonder
2014-11-07 18:57:02	 *	taron facepalms
2014-11-07 18:57:27	 *	taron claps and attempts to pretend they actually knew what was going on
2014-11-07 18:59:44	 *	relsqui likewise if it makes you feel better
2014-11-07 19:04:49	taron	\o/
2014-11-07 19:08:13	 *	relsqui estimates they're getting 1%/10m right now, not counting trades
2014-11-07 19:08:57	taron	niiiiice
2014-11-07 19:09:32	relsqui	3k laborers, not quite reliably supplied though -_-
2014-11-07 19:09:56	taron	yeah that's the bit I had trouble with when working with wonders, and the reason I basically gave up aside from trades
2014-11-07 19:10:07	relsqui	yeah, is hard
2014-11-07 19:10:25	relsqui	gives me some guidance on where to put my workers though, heh
2014-11-07 19:10:36	taron	indeed
2014-11-07 19:12:31	 *	relsqui amuses self making all the population numbers even thousands
2014-11-07 19:16:48	relsqui	I should probably stop building or reduce army, it's not really important to me
2014-11-07 19:19:07	relsqui	2/3
2014-11-07 19:19:53	taron	I got too much entertainment value out of obliterating everyone around me.
2014-11-07 19:20:01	relsqui	yeah but you can't actually see the effect at all
2014-11-07 19:20:05	relsqui	there's infinite numbers of neighbors to smash
2014-11-07 19:20:16	taron	true
2014-11-07 19:20:37	hylleddin	OK, I have to know what you're playing.
2014-11-07 19:20:42	taron	I'd probably have been more motivated to kill people had it been more limited
2014-11-07 19:20:55	relsqui	yes
2014-11-07 19:20:57	relsqui	hahaha

2014-11-07 19:31:13	taron	sometimes I wonder how I manage to avoid being an odd sort of gothic caricature
2014-11-07 19:31:20	taron	or if I've even managed to avoid it in the first place >_>

2014-11-07 19:34:25	@dom	:DS<
2014-11-07 19:34:49	taron	listening to sopor aeternus is roughly like having your soul and any remaining happiness in it crushed in a vice
2014-11-07 19:34:54	tamgc	goth takes too much effort
2014-11-07 19:34:58	@dom	false
2014-11-07 19:35:03	@dom	my happiness cannot be crushed
2014-11-07 19:35:09	@dom	it is encased in my hatred
2014-11-07 19:35:20	taron	you'd probably like suicide commando then
2014-11-07 19:35:22	taron	:P
2014-11-07 19:35:25	@dom	doubt it
2014-11-07 19:35:29	@dom	suicide is for chumps
2014-11-07 19:35:56	taron	mm, I find them an adequate expression of hatred for most things.
2014-11-07 19:36:05	taron	hellraiser and cut_bleed_eviscerate come to mind
2014-11-07 19:36:51	taron	rotersand is another good band, especially the lullaby version of We Will Kill Them All
2014-11-07 19:37:16	@dom	is this for real?
2014-11-07 19:37:24	taron	lol, yes
2014-11-07 19:37:29	@dom	I mean I know goths are posers, but this sounds like they are trying way too hard
2014-11-07 19:37:35	@dom	like, cmon, stop overcompensating
2014-11-07 19:37:36	taron	hahahaha

2014-11-07 19:47:22	relsqui	and then rejected it
2014-11-07 19:47:25	relsqui	because that sounds boring

2014-11-07 19:50:32	tamgc	it's a good base, but then gotta keep yourself entertained
2014-11-07 19:51:05	@dom	gotta be bored sometime, why not get paid for it
2014-11-07 19:51:10	@dom	well, not gotta be bored
2014-11-07 19:51:14	@dom	but statistically will be
2014-11-07 19:51:20	tamgc	heh
2014-11-07 19:51:29	@dom	and money increases the likelihood of me being able to do fun things not at work
2014-11-07 19:51:38	relsqui	rather be bored when I'm relaxing :P then I'm not required to be there
2014-11-07 19:52:06	@dom	bored and relaxing are mutually exclusive imo
2014-11-07 19:53:45	relsqui	well, okay, but in my free time
2014-11-07 19:53:48	relsqui	'cause then I have more choices
2014-11-07 19:53:58	@dom	in *my* free time, im not bored
2014-11-07 19:54:49	relsqui	yah 'cause you can choose to stop doing boring things
2014-11-07 19:54:50	relsqui	that's my point
2014-11-07 19:55:03	@dom	yeah, cuz I have money to not have to do boring things
2014-11-07 19:55:17	@dom	maybe we have a different definition of boring :P
2014-11-07 19:56:30	tamgc	both are valid approaches, diff balance works for diff people...

2014-11-07 21:10:57	taron	literally doesn't matter at all as long as you have enough food to keep people going, I should think
2014-11-07 21:11:03	relsqui	I guess, yeah
2014-11-07 21:11:23	taron	well, actually, you do need to have people to generate faith or whatever it's called in that game
2014-11-07 21:11:29	taron	so you can raise the zombies in the first place
2014-11-07 21:11:42	taron	but I don't think those have to be humans once you get to that point?

2014-11-07 21:54:08	@dom	nah, its more like I don't know much about weechat since I don't use it
2014-11-07 21:54:15	@dom	I dont wanna talk it down, its not my place

2014-11-08 13:15:44	taron	Wish we were allowed to have slow cookers in the dorms or I'd make some of my own.
2014-11-08 13:17:56	taron	I'd share but I kinda ate most of it already ._.
2014-11-08 13:19:21	relsqui	hehehe I don't blame you
2014-11-08 13:20:00	relsqui	I make ... I don't know if it's Real Congee but something congeelike sometimes when I'm sick. rice porridge in broth, add veggies, eggs, whatever else. such comfort food.
2014-11-08 13:21:41	taron	nice :) my mom just makes it whenever she has extra meat or whatever lying around for flavoring
2014-11-08 13:21:51	relsqui	yeah. good for that.
2014-11-08 13:24:24	taron	Not gonna lie, it makes me really happy that people actually know what congee is around here.
2014-11-08 13:25:18	relsqui	hehe, thank my mom for that one
2014-11-08 13:25:32	relsqui	... I on the other hand was o_O when I mentioned making challah and had to explain to three people what it was
2014-11-08 13:25:48	taron	o_O seriously? 
2014-11-08 13:27:05	taron	granted my parents have introduced me to enough random foods that I can walk out of Safeway with chicken gizzards and sardines and think nothing of it, so I'm probably not a good gauge of what foods people normally know about lol
2014-11-08 13:27:30	relsqui	hehehe
2014-11-08 13:28:19	@bajr	hmm, having trouble finding out how to avoid a copy-paste regex
2014-11-08 13:28:54	@bajr	like if i wanted to match (regex) (+ (regex))
2014-11-08 13:29:01	relsqui	copy-paste?
2014-11-08 13:29:49	@bajr	I forget the right term for it
2014-11-08 13:30:42	@bajr	I tried (regex) (+ %1), but it's not working so now I'm wondering if the version of regex I'm using supports it
2014-11-08 13:31:05	relsqui	you might just be talking about something I've never heard of
2014-11-08 13:32:38	 *	bajr ponders
2014-11-08 13:33:07	relsqui	anyway, need to get ready to go mentor

2014-11-08 19:43:11	relsqui	at least I don't think anyone I was with spoke cantonese :P
2014-11-08 19:43:22	taron	it's so much more convenient though
2014-11-08 19:43:43	taron	but also has the unfortunate side effect of me not knowing any of the dish names because she never taught me any
2014-11-08 19:43:56	relsqui	I was like that with sushi for a long time
2014-11-08 19:43:59	relsqui	....
2014-11-08 19:44:00	relsqui	now I want sushi
2014-11-08 19:44:09	taron	there's a place by the park blocks, dunno if it's any good though
2014-11-08 19:44:15	relsqui	yeah, I've seen that
2014-11-08 19:44:18	relsqui	and I dunno either
2014-11-08 19:44:18	taron	also kaitenzushi on the 1st floor of broadway
2014-11-08 19:44:24	relsqui	oh yeah!
2014-11-08 19:44:26	relsqui	totally forgot about that
2014-11-08 19:44:27	relsqui	have you tried it?
2014-11-08 19:44:39	taron	yeah, went on move in day
2014-11-08 19:44:47	tamgc	hm, not sure if there's any sushi places around the SE 82nd/powell area
2014-11-08 19:45:03	relsqui	there's one down powell from me a little which I've heard is all right
2014-11-08 19:45:07	relsqui	50th-60th or so
2014-11-08 19:45:09	taron	was pretty good, lots of specialty stuff though and I tend to prefer more of the basics
2014-11-08 19:45:13	tamgc	taron: is that the one near mcmen's/SB3?

2014-11-08 19:45:34	taron	hell yes
2014-11-08 19:45:35	relsqui	so it's not that weird
2014-11-08 19:45:48	relsqui	but it was confusing when we went out for sushi in CA, lol
2014-11-08 19:45:50	taron	tamgc: roughly, I think?
2014-11-08 19:45:54	relsqui	we turned out to have different ideas of what that meant
2014-11-08 19:46:14	relsqui	tamgc: yeah, if taron and I are thinking of the same place it's on park like a block south from sb3's cross street
2014-11-08 19:46:20	 *	tamgc prefers blue fin over that park block one...
2014-11-08 19:46:45	tamgc	murata is good, if you're up for a walk from FAB
2014-11-08 19:46:50	tamgc	bit more restauranty
2014-11-08 19:46:52	relsqui	wheresat?

2014-11-08 19:47:41	relsqui	look, I'm bad at portland, okay <_<
2014-11-08 19:47:46	tamgc	so basically if you go to the streetcar stop, and just head north
2014-11-08 19:47:54	tamgc	until you're just out of the parks, that's where it is
2014-11-08 19:48:00	relsqui	which streetcar stop?
2014-11-08 19:48:22	tamgc	karmabot: taron is if you try hard and believe in yourself, everything is within walking distance
2014-11-08 19:48:22	karmabot	Affirmative, tamgc.

2014-11-08 19:51:52	 *	relsqui takes notes, where by takes notes they mean they log irc

2014-11-08 20:37:31	@bajr	relsqui: meaning you gave zuul all your ones or exchanged away the ones?
2014-11-08 20:41:30	relsqui	I put in $100 and took out smaller things than that.
2014-11-08 20:41:35	relsqui	(I put in $100 in one bill)

2014-11-08 20:42:19	@bajr	:D
2014-11-08 20:42:30	relsqui	... so I *mostly* took out 20s but it's still an improvement, lol
2014-11-08 20:42:38	relsqui	and I took out some smaller stuff because what I actually wanted was change for the vending machine
2014-11-08 20:42:43	relsqui	... which apparently takes cards now, lol

2014-11-08 21:51:36	relsqui	and I'm having a hard time deciding which.
2014-11-08 21:52:04	@dom	well its probably too late to quit
2014-11-08 21:52:11	@dom	like, drop the class
2014-11-08 21:52:12	relsqui	it's *never* too late to quit <_<
2014-11-08 21:52:13	relsqui	yeah
2014-11-08 21:52:18	relsqui	I think?
2014-11-08 21:52:24	relsqui	I mean, it's too late for a refund, dunno if for a W
2014-11-08 21:53:11	relsqui	ah, not quite.
2014-11-08 21:54:38	relsqui	maybe that's the way to go.

2014-11-08 22:00:44	@dom	hmmm
2014-11-08 22:00:51	@dom	can I pipe nmap to a loop like that?
2014-11-08 22:01:04	@dom	I know read takes input like that
2014-11-08 22:01:06	relsqui	yah. while is just a command.
2014-11-08 22:01:12	relsqui	I mean, it's in practice a builtin
2014-11-08 22:01:15	relsqui	but historically it's a command.
2014-11-08 22:01:39	@dom	no man entry for while

2014-11-08 22:33:28	@dom	where is your hearthstone bound
2014-11-08 22:33:38	taron	it probably would be if there was a bed or a couch
2014-11-08 22:34:14	relsqui	and that's why we're not allowed to have one
2014-11-08 22:34:24	taron	lol
2014-11-08 22:34:56	relsqui	I'm pretty sure that's actually the reason <_<
2014-11-08 22:35:09	taron	I"m not doubting that, but it's still funny to me

2014-11-09 13:10:07	taron	I believe you mean always.

2014-11-09 13:13:19	@dom	sure
2014-11-09 13:13:29	taron	the original was much better imo, reversed just didn't match up quite as well. either that or it's the lyrics that made it
2014-11-09 13:13:49	relsqui	yeah, I don't like it better either, but I like both a lot

2014-11-09 13:16:33	@dom	then fucking dont
2014-11-09 13:16:34	relsqui	and I can't think of a good enough reason not to
2014-11-09 13:16:43	@dom	you dont want to go
2014-11-09 13:16:47	Golem	its too late to get money back right

2014-11-09 13:16:52	Golem	HMM
2014-11-09 13:17:05	@dom	you can still get a W though
2014-11-09 13:17:06	relsqui	basically the question is "can anyone tell me a reason it's worse to have a W on transcript than F"
2014-11-09 13:17:07	@dom	right?
2014-11-09 13:17:09	relsqui	yeah
2014-11-09 13:17:16	taron	I got nothing.

2014-11-09 13:18:51	relsqui	okay, is done.
2014-11-09 13:18:55	relsqui	fuck that class. :|
2014-11-09 13:18:57	Golem	You might need to ask your prof about withdrawing, as some can be jerkholes about it after a certain point
2014-11-09 13:19:07	relsqui	how so?
2014-11-09 13:19:08	Golem	dont know psu's stance on this though
2014-11-09 13:19:11	relsqui	(like, what is he able to do)
2014-11-09 13:19:30	Golem	in some universities, they can just assume that you didnt withdraw and just stopped coming to classes
2014-11-09 13:19:39	taron	o_O
2014-11-09 13:19:45	Golem	they can choose to not let you withdraw
2014-11-09 13:19:50	Golem	basically
2014-11-09 13:19:59	Golem	then again I dont think thats PSU's policy
2014-11-09 13:20:11	Golem	seems a bit of a jerk policy
2014-11-09 13:20:33	relsqui	that seems kinda weird given that I can fill out the form that says "okay you withdrew" :p
2014-11-09 13:20:52	Golem	yar
2014-11-09 13:21:03	relsqui	haha I just realized I don't have any classes west of fifth

2014-11-09 13:22:32	Golem	so if you can afford to sign of the tuition, W might be the way to go if you dont think its  going to end well
2014-11-09 13:23:38	Golem	if you are recieving financial aid, they might get uppity about it, acording to advising
2014-11-09 13:23:46	Golem	so that might be a consideration
2014-11-09 13:23:52	relsqui	I mean, that's what I asked about it

2014-11-09 13:57:47	taron	just raids I think? I didn't really use them tbh
2014-11-09 13:57:58	relsqui	it doesn't seem like they're participating in outgoing raids
2014-11-09 13:58:02	relsqui	can't really tell though

2014-11-09 21:17:37	@bajr	hmm, I need a second opinion on a thing if someone's up and willing to listen
2014-11-09 21:18:31	@bajr	(it's about parsing dice notation)
2014-11-09 21:19:50	taron	I'm terrible at parsing or else I'd attempt to help
2014-11-09 21:21:04	 *	nightfly is willing to offer uninformed opinions on the matter :)
2014-11-09 21:22:17	@bajr	so, two methods of parsing valid dice rolls and then interpretting them
2014-11-09 21:23:15	@bajr	method one is to build a iterative/recursive (not sure yet) function that reads the notation character by character to determine a valid roll
2014-11-09 21:25:07	@bajr	method two is to use a rather ugly looking regular expression to identify if the expression is valid, and then find a way to get the substrings out of the regex and parse those potentially more easily than method one
2014-11-09 21:25:52	@bajr	and when I say it's ugly i mean it looks like this:
2014-11-09 21:25:54	@bajr	^[0-9]{0,2}dbajr$|(^[0-9]{0,6}d([0-9]{1,6}|[Ff])? *([-+*x/] *(([0-9]{0,6}d([0-9]{1,6}|[Ff])?)|(([0-9]{0,6}([LlHh]))|([0-9]{1,6}))))*$)
2014-11-09 21:29:52	nightfly	if you never plan on extending it method two might work, otherwise something like method one makes more sense

2014-11-10 08:30:18	relsqui	I totally believe it's true but find it weird
2014-11-10 08:30:21	relsqui	I don't like boilerplate, in general
2014-11-10 08:30:22	relsqui	heh
2014-11-10 08:30:47	@bajr	i mean, you have to make the boilerplate first to make sure it suits your needs, but once it's made, it's consistent
2014-11-10 08:30:54	@bajr	and yeah, i totally agree with that

2014-11-10 12:54:34	hylleddin	(But not right now.)
2014-11-10 12:55:01	taron	i just put it in a separate tab in tmux until I got things relatively figured out and could actually switch over

2014-11-11 17:26:55	Golem	why do online applications ask you to upload your resume, AND THEN MAKE YOU ENTER THE ENTIRE DAMN THING AGIAN IN THIER BADLY DESIGNED SHITTY WEB INTERFACE
2014-11-11 17:27:01	Golem	arghhhhh
2014-11-11 17:27:09	@dom	cuz you will do it\
2014-11-11 17:27:15	@dom	its the desperation factor
2014-11-11 17:27:26	Golem	2 bored cats could build a better system on a lunch break with wordpress.  
2014-11-11 17:27:40	@dom	why do they need wordpress
2014-11-11 17:27:48	Golem	they dont 
2014-11-11 17:27:59	Golem	its just what they brought with them to lunch.  mostly as a curiosity
2014-11-11 17:31:38	Golem	Why do they want an address for previous jobs.  They are not going to go there.  They dont give a shit about the location.  Why ask >.<
2014-11-11 17:31:42	Golem	argggghhh
2014-11-11 17:31:49	Golem	So very sick of this

2014-11-11 17:32:27	Golem	I would say so, except there is NO REASON FOR THEM TO HAVE THAT FORMAILITY
2014-11-11 17:32:38	@dom	what if they have to check to see if thats a real address
2014-11-11 17:32:42	@dom	or that you actually worked there
2014-11-11 17:32:56	Golem	they cant use that information, many jobs cant reveal their location if you are in healthcare, and they wont travel there or check that addresss
2014-11-11 17:33:00	@dom	I could put "former employer: Dr. Evil address: 7437 The Moon"
2014-11-11 17:33:19	@dom	they can check to see if it even exists
2014-11-11 17:33:30	Golem	they can
2014-11-11 17:33:31	Golem	they wont
2014-11-11 17:33:38	@dom	but they need to be able to
2014-11-11 17:33:38	Golem	they never do.  I have seen the paperwork
2014-11-11 17:33:40	@dom	thats the thing
2014-11-11 17:33:50	@dom	its a holdover from before email

2014-11-11 17:34:05	Golem	sigh
2014-11-11 17:34:09	@dom	if you really think the job industry will change in 40 years
2014-11-11 17:34:16	@dom	I mean, it should
2014-11-11 17:34:18	@dom	but it wont
2014-11-11 17:34:21	@dom	because why would it?
2014-11-11 17:34:27	Golem	they built a WEB interface.  You think they could at least try

2014-11-11 17:47:34	askore	I suggest a metal water bottle filled with very hot water and then put in a sock or a towel or something
2014-11-11 17:48:21	Golem	a sock?
2014-11-11 17:48:22	@dom	taron: use handwarmers

2014-11-11 17:48:33	Golem	oh I see

2014-11-11 17:48:45	askore	and if the water bottle is poorly insulated you'd burn your hands on it
2014-11-11 17:49:09	@dom	taron: which is why I suggest hand warmers, they are super handy and usually pretty cheap
2014-11-11 17:49:19	tamgc	and then use as weapon?
2014-11-11 17:49:26	taron	also you know you went to OSU when you read what askore said and immediately think "oh, a flask full of whiskey"
2014-11-11 17:49:27	@dom	I used to keep 30 or so in my backpack, but I got out of the habit when I moved here

2014-11-11 17:50:57	Golem	train cat to sleep on feet
2014-11-11 17:50:58	askore	tamgc: only if the cat is overheating. Otherwise they would welcome the shared warmth

2014-11-11 19:44:11	tamgc	lenovo something
2014-11-11 19:44:24	taron	thus far is the extent of my planning
2014-11-11 19:44:31	askore	mmm, I have a lenovo T series something
2014-11-11 19:44:49	askore	its a pretty good little ultrabook looking thing
2014-11-11 19:44:56	askore	the trackpad is kinda weird

2014-11-11 19:46:38	tamgc	so like 15 years...and the battery still had like 1.5 hrs...was slightly amused by that...
2014-11-11 19:46:51	taron	I have an ideapad y560 which ran like a tank until I accidentally kicked it off my bed one day >_> also horrible battery life
2014-11-11 19:47:02	tamgc	I like the thinkpad yoga, the x200 series stuff, prefer the older style keyboards
2014-11-11 19:47:25	tamgc	my x220 has like 12 hrs battery life with the 9-cell
2014-11-11 19:47:35	tamgc	and can get a slice for like 24 hr battery life >.>
2014-11-11 19:47:45	askore	mine has like 6 hours? and that's with linux, which has terrible power management
2014-11-11 19:48:10	tamgc	I get about 6 when doing video playback

2014-11-11 19:50:31	askore	I've finished less than half of it and it's due tomorrow...
2014-11-11 19:51:48	taron	other criterion is currently needs to be less than $500

2014-11-11 19:53:23	askore	it's 'half' indefinitely
2014-11-11 19:53:34	askore	but 50% max on a homework is never a good sign
2014-11-11 19:53:48	askore	oh well, better than nothing
2014-11-11 19:54:24	tamgc	yeah...and overall weight of it may not be much

2014-11-11 19:58:59	tamgc	not seeing anything that jumps out for me as a must have sort of deal
2014-11-11 19:59:18	tamgc	for the <500 ones
2014-11-11 20:03:18	tamgc	also, lenovos tend to be pretty servicable, so depending on what's b0rked, an option may be to do a repair and save up for a better one
2014-11-11 20:10:51	taron	thing is, the hinge got worse after the last time it was sericed, so I'm not optimistic. this is also unfortunately the exception to the "lenovos are serviceable" rule
2014-11-11 20:11:28	tamgc	hm yeah
2014-11-11 20:11:46	tamgc	most of the models that I'd say "go for it" are actually in th 5-800 bracket of the outlet
2014-11-11 20:11:46	taron	I have a heavy duty gaming desktop so performance isn't something I'm overly worried about beyond being able to do system administration tasks and maybe a few basic games here and there
2014-11-11 20:11:53	tamgc	(~700 mostly)
2014-11-11 20:12:00	taron	yeah that makes sense
2014-11-11 20:12:23	taron	I'm making a decent amount right now so I'm thinking I might hold off for a bit and see how long this thing holds out for first
2014-11-11 20:12:28	tamgc	not saying the <500 ones are bad, just not familiar with them
2014-11-11 20:12:46	taron	lenovo's the only brand where I'd trust anything <500 personally
2014-11-11 20:12:53	taron	but it's still a question of whether it's worth it
2014-11-11 20:13:15	tamgc	heard decent things about chromebooks for minimalistic stuff, depending on what you want to do with it
2014-11-11 20:14:55	taron	first thing I'm doing with it regardless is ripping the OS off in favor of arch

2014-11-11 20:19:56	hylleddin	Yeah, I was just wondering whether I missed them last time I checked, or if they were recently surplused.
2014-11-11 20:21:15	tamgc	hm, newegg has recertified  lenovos...
2014-11-11 20:21:30	hylleddin	They aren't listed under "computers" or "electronics", oddly enough.
2014-11-11 20:21:52	tamgc	hylleddin: ah, possibly...although being a quant 1 situation, I'd be kind of wary as to why it was surplused in the first place
2014-11-11 20:22:38	tamgc	erm...that was a general thought, didn't mean to direct to you -.-
2014-11-11 20:27:07	hylleddin	Those LCD monitors are really cheap.

2014-11-11 20:32:29	tamgc	3x3 of 17" monitors >.>
2014-11-11 20:34:29	calemmer	yeah that is a pretty good deal, but you have to think about rigging if you are going to stack monitors
2014-11-11 20:35:32	taron	I wanna buy more so bad but I only have room for the two I already have on my desk.
2014-11-11 20:36:18	calemmer	I have 1 monitor that i hook up to my laptop because I dont have a desktop :/
2014-11-11 20:36:34	hylleddin	I would need to buy an actual desk first.
2014-11-11 20:37:06	tamgc	just get those steel rack rails and jury rig something >.>
2014-11-11 20:37:15	hylleddin	(Or stick them in my office. Hmm...)
2014-11-11 20:37:55	tamgc	calemmer: you can pick up an Optiplex 745 for like $30 at surplus heh
2014-11-11 20:37:55	hylleddin	That would mean I would have to go to my office to play computer games or watch netflix. Maybe not then.
2014-11-11 20:45:12	calemmer	am I the only one that is hoping for snow this week?
2014-11-11 20:45:49	hylleddin	Nope!
2014-11-11 20:46:46	hylleddin	I am sufficiently happy with just the below freezing temperatures, though.
2014-11-11 20:47:06	calemmer	I hate the cold, but I want snow :D
2014-11-11 20:49:41	calemmer	does anyone have experience with the max being shut down because of ice?
2014-11-11 20:49:51	calemmer	Im curious how often it happens
2014-11-11 20:50:09	hylleddin	It happened last year.
2014-11-11 20:50:19	hylleddin	People told me that was unusual.
2014-11-11 20:50:49	calemmer	ok thanks
2014-11-11 20:54:21	tamgc	it generally happens in ice storms
2014-11-11 20:54:42	tamgc	snow/ice storms are kind of rare though
2014-11-11 20:54:59	calemmer	yeah that is what i hear
2014-11-11 20:56:13	tamgc	usually it's a couple of inches at most if we're lucky
2014-11-11 20:56:39	tamgc	but also keep in mind people suck at driving in any amount of snow and be prepped accordingly -.-
2014-11-11 20:58:18	taron	thank god, I hate walking to class in deep snow
2014-11-11 20:58:30	taron	you know there's a problem when you fall on your ass more in combat boots than in regular footwear
2014-11-11 20:59:24	taron	which reminds me I need to rescue those from corvallis >_>
2014-11-11 20:59:46	relsqui	XD
2014-11-11 20:59:54	relsqui	man I want boots
2014-11-11 20:59:55	relsqui	I should buy shoes
2014-11-11 21:03:20	tamgc	shoes++ they're useful things to have
2014-11-11 21:16:10	calemmer	shoes++
2014-11-11 21:17:20	calemmer	I used to hate shoes, but I have been converted

2014-11-11 21:46:40	relsqui	I bet you could get dom in on pizza though >_>
2014-11-11 21:47:01	tamgc	speaking of which, don't remember if the Frying Scotsman were mentioned, but they do some good stuff (battered, not breaded though)
2014-11-11 21:47:10	taron	I was contemplating going out and grabbing something, just effort figuring out what's actually open >_>
2014-11-11 21:47:22	relsqui	yell at dom about how we don't have a bot for it any more
2014-11-11 21:47:25	relsqui	because it's his fault

2014-11-11 22:02:16	calemmer	it is REALLY windy
2014-11-11 22:05:50	tamgc	ayep -.-
2014-11-11 22:05:59	 *	tamgc just hoping limited damage at this point
2014-11-11 22:06:09	taron	on second thought sweaters++ not even how itchy it is is enough to make me angry at it with how warm I am right now
2014-11-11 22:06:31	 *	taron is also amused by all the people complaining about the wind
2014-11-11 22:06:41	tamgc	fleece++ flanel++ too
2014-11-11 22:06:56	taron	indeed
2014-11-11 22:07:23	tamgc	it's not bad, until a tree takes out an area's power
2014-11-11 22:07:33	tamgc	or damages house/car/causes traffic jam/etc
2014-11-11 22:08:40	calemmer	it has already caused trees to fall onto the max train tracks
2014-11-11 22:08:45	taron	see, I just got used to that shit in ohio
2014-11-11 22:08:59	tamgc	there's trees in ohio? =)
2014-11-11 22:09:38	tamgc	I think it's one of those snow things, where since it's rare here, people aren't prepared to react properly
2014-11-11 22:09:45	taron	there's a few, but you have to look really hard and if you scare them they'll run away and hide between all the cornfields
2014-11-11 22:09:48	tamgc	or have the resources
2014-11-11 22:09:54	taron	yeah, probably
2014-11-11 22:10:16	tamgc	karmabot: ohio is has shy Ents
2014-11-11 22:10:16	karmabot	K, tamgc.
2014-11-11 22:10:19	taron	unfortunately ohio people did the same thing with snow and ice even though it wasn't rare -_-
2014-11-11 22:10:33	 *	relsqui giggles
2014-11-11 22:10:55	tamgc	that sounds like how we deal with rain -.-
2014-11-11 22:12:44	taron	ohio people are a hell of a lot worse with rain than oregonians x_x
2014-11-11 22:13:20	calemmer	Im excited for the possible snow :D
2014-11-11 22:17:18	taron	I'm excited for having to walk 5mins instead of 30mins to class in the snow this time =_=
2014-11-11 22:17:39	tamgc	>.<
2014-11-11 22:25:37	taron	I could make a joke about having to go uphill in the snow to school and shit but it's less fun when it's accurate >_>
2014-11-11 22:26:21	relsqui	aha
2014-11-11 22:26:23	relsqui	haha
2014-11-11 22:26:28	tamgc	taron++ heh
2014-11-11 22:26:45	tamgc	karmabot: taron is walked uphill both ways in snow to school
2014-11-11 22:26:45	karmabot	Done, tamgc.
2014-11-11 22:42:05	taron	my dorm freshman year was actually at the top of a hill, but campus was at the top of another hill, so it was /literally/ uphill both ways. still a significantly shorter walk than living off campus last year though

2014-11-12 12:54:11	@dom	"I am too incompetent to deal with you, please talk to someone else"
2014-11-12 12:54:22	relsqui	right 
2014-11-12 12:54:34	relsqui	and now I have to kill an hour on main campus 
2014-11-12 12:54:54	relsqui	since that's not enough time to come back or do anything useful 
2014-11-12 12:54:56	@dom	I narrowly finished my take home midterm
2014-11-12 12:54:58	@dom	yeah
2014-11-12 12:55:10	relsqui	hence slow typing, I'm on my phone 
2014-11-12 12:55:29	relsqui	although iirc there's a lab in NH or something? 
2014-11-12 12:55:41	@dom	some in kramer, some in the library
2014-11-12 12:55:43	relsqui	I don't know oit labs, lol 
2014-11-12 12:55:44	@dom	art labs in NH
2014-11-12 12:55:49	relsqui	aw
2014-11-12 12:55:55	@dom	the art lab in NH is the one I work at :P
2014-11-12 12:56:10	@dom	you could pretend to be an art student, you just couldn't print iirc
2014-11-12 12:56:16	@dom	its on second floor
2014-11-12 12:56:16	relsqui	yeah I thought there also used to be a general one 
2014-11-12 12:56:23	@dom	its general login
2014-11-12 12:56:53	nightfly	The one in the basement used to be general access, now I think the former math one is the general access one
2014-11-12 12:57:13	relsqui	wheresat
2014-11-12 12:59:23	tamgc	NH461 is the general use lab now
2014-11-12 12:59:46	tamgc	they traded space with the math lab up there
2014-11-12 12:59:52	relsqui	aha
2014-11-12 13:00:01	relsqui	thanks tamgc++
2014-11-12 13:00:45	tamgc	(Disclaimer: Room numbers may have changed...iirc there was another room being combined with it...math didn't have the money...so they traded space...)
2014-11-12 13:02:39	@dom	that must be all the moving and bumping up there on the weekends
2014-11-12 13:02:46	@dom	I thought the building was only 3 stories tall, kek
2014-11-12 13:09:24	relsqui	dom: it was, then they did the remodel, see
2014-11-12 13:10:27	relsqui	typing my cat username and my oit password to log into something is weird XD
2014-11-12 13:10:47	@dom	I know, right
2014-11-12 13:13:49	taron	every time I have to log into an OIT box I start typing my cat username, every time I try to log into a cat box I end up typing taron. pretty sure the only reason I don't fuck up logging into my own boxes is because I have keys for that shit and zsh completes it for me =_=
2014-11-12 13:13:57	relsqui	lol
2014-11-12 13:14:03	relsqui	yeah I've tried to log into rawr as relsqui once or twice
2014-11-12 13:14:40	relsqui	taron: the confusing thing for me is that my oit login and my cat login are actually the same
2014-11-12 13:15:01	taron	I am jealous.
2014-11-12 13:15:05	relsqui	taron: although I guess maybe you have the thing where sometimes you're logging into oitland boxes while physically in fab
2014-11-12 13:15:11	relsqui	which is a different kind of confusign
2014-11-12 13:15:22	taron	yep
2014-11-12 13:16:35	taron	every mentor session I stop and think "fuck, am i logging in with my mcecs stuff or my cat login"
2014-11-12 13:16:53	relsqui	haha
2014-11-12 13:17:00	relsqui	I'd say "you get used to it" but honestly I wouldn't know
2014-11-12 13:17:11	relsqui	I log into a PSU-owned computer with something other than my cat account at *most* once a month
2014-11-12 13:17:13	taron	and then my github is a different name entirely from everything else I have except my twitter
2014-11-12 13:17:14	relsqui	probably less
2014-11-12 13:17:37	relsqui	haha I wondered about that
2014-11-12 13:17:48	taron	I could probably say the same outside of labs except I keep accidentally killing my session on rita
2014-11-12 13:18:03	relsqui	lol
2014-11-12 13:18:19	taron	and yeah necrobuffalo was what I went by more often on the internet until eve happened and I realized taron was much shorter
2014-11-12 13:18:55	relsqui	haha
2014-11-12 13:19:00	relsqui	"previously, I thought they were the same length"
2014-11-12 13:19:09	relsqui	"necrobuffalo" makes me think of don't starve
2014-11-12 13:19:29	taron	I really need to play that game one of these days.
2014-11-12 13:19:42	taron	and to be fair I didn't go by taron at all prior to eve :P
2014-11-12 13:19:51	@dom	^ same although with wow
2014-11-12 13:19:59	@dom	I had a different, worse nick before that
2014-11-12 13:20:14	relsqui	I should play it again, I liked it a lot but haven't touched it in a while
2014-11-12 13:20:23	relsqui	it's one of those games that's fun enough that you don't mind dying over and over
2014-11-12 13:20:29	relsqui	like a good roguelike
2014-11-12 13:20:33	@dom	its a roguelite
2014-11-12 13:20:37	stormcrow	relsqui: eve or wow?
2014-11-12 13:20:43	relsqui	don't starve

2014-11-12 13:20:56	@dom	nobody wants to pay for wow
2014-11-12 13:20:59	relsqui	lol
2014-11-12 13:21:05	relsqui	yeah the difference is I'm also not gonna
2014-11-12 13:21:07	@dom	its mancat's subway analogy, only for video games

2014-11-12 13:23:18	relsqui	it's squishier than I'd like but the weight is just right that I can go like a motherfucker on it

2014-11-12 13:25:41	calemmer	you should use a mechanical relsqui
2014-11-12 13:25:44	relsqui	which puts it *right* in the sweet spot for some really vicious nerdsniping

2014-11-12 14:42:41	relsqui	>_> y'know
2014-11-12 14:42:49	relsqui	mancat was talking about picking up another language and iirc german is on his list
2014-11-12 14:42:55	relsqui	and I am basically generically in favor of learning more langauges
2014-11-12 14:43:22	taron	if I could get paid to learn languages I totally would
2014-11-12 14:43:39	taron	as it stands I just don't have enough time though :/
2014-11-12 14:43:40	relsqui	I KNOW, RIGHT
2014-11-12 14:43:42	relsqui	@_@
2014-11-12 14:45:21	taron	reminds me, I have not spent nearly enough time in the foreign language aisles of powells since moving up here
2014-11-12 14:46:47	relsqui	anyway I would be totally into a few of us learning german in an extracurricular fashion >_> but you have a head start on us I think
2014-11-12 14:51:00	taron	Nur ein bisschen :) but yeah I'm completely in favor of this.
2014-11-12 14:51:43	taron	also if people are willing to get up early enough to talk to her I can try and get miya to answer questions and stuff
2014-11-12 14:52:21	relsqui	define get up early enough <_< >_>
2014-11-12 14:52:48	taron	she goes to bed at 11PM her time nearly every day, sometimes earlier
2014-11-12 14:53:37	taron	not sure what 11PM in Hamburg works out to here currently
2014-11-12 14:54:30	taron	her gf's usually up a hell of a lot later but she's not half as comfortable with english
2014-11-12 14:54:57	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-12 14:55:59	taron	anyway point being I know plenty of germans I can probably nag with questions :P
2014-11-12 14:56:13	relsqui	\o/
2014-11-12 14:56:18	relsqui	much like I bug zigdon with all my hebrew questions ^_^
2014-11-12 15:06:02	taron	neat, lasted until 3PM before feeling like I really desperately need caffeine for once
2014-11-12 15:06:06	relsqui	haha
2014-11-12 15:06:55	taron	hitting a new low in the laziness department though, I keep thinking I should get some and then thinking, "but... but... but... the convenience store is in the other building!"
2014-11-12 15:07:23	tamgc	taron: if you're in ARC or CATspace, technically, it's the same building =P
2014-11-12 15:07:35	taron	this is fair.
2014-11-12 15:07:50	taron	I still kind of think of this half as being EB though.
2014-11-12 15:08:12	tamgc	heh
2014-11-12 15:10:01	 *	taron sighs and gets up
2014-11-12 15:10:32	taron	if I'm not back in 10 minutes I got eaten by the fabyrinth
2014-11-12 15:11:33	Takua	Oh right...can someone tell Krua Bangkok that I won't be back until the 21st >_>
2014-11-12 15:11:46	Takua	(I couldn't talk to them on Saturday)
2014-11-12 15:12:52	tamgc	do they know you by irc name or meatspace name or by visual?
2014-11-12 15:13:01	Takua	Meatspace name
2014-11-12 15:13:25	tamgc	cool, /me will try to remember to stop by after workish

2014-11-12 15:17:39	 *	taron has mountain dew, is pacified.
2014-11-12 15:18:25	tamgc	karmabot: taron is pacified by mountain dew
2014-11-12 15:18:25	karmabot	Okay, tamgc.
2014-11-12 15:18:45	 *	tamgc imagining taron being super wired on mt dew as "pacified"
2014-11-12 15:18:47	@bajr	wait... does this mean the zuul could potentially have another consumer of mt ew?
2014-11-12 15:19:03	tamgc	mt ewe is the field variety
2014-11-12 15:19:16	@bajr	tamgc++
2014-11-12 15:19:28	@bajr	mt ewe could also be pasteurized
2014-11-12 15:19:44	taron	I believe the word you were looking for is "definitely."

2014-11-12 15:31:08	tamgc	caching?
2014-11-12 15:32:38	taron	possibly
2014-11-12 15:59:24	calemmer	it is even worse to me when things start working and i dont know why
2014-11-12 16:01:17	tamgc	inconsistancy-- when trying to troubleshoot -.-
2014-11-12 16:06:37	taron	agreed =_=
2014-11-12 16:07:03	taron	fixed a whole ton of bugs today though and got the acm bot up and running again so at least I can say I've been productive
2014-11-12 16:13:10	taron	small reasons why I love tmux: hitting backspace past the beginning of a line on my laptop, watching the number on the badge on my work mac attached to the same session tick up

2014-11-12 16:45:20	taron	I'm quite fond of a python one I found elsewhere, "you try to shoot yourself in the foot but keep hitting the whitespace between your toes"
2014-11-12 16:50:19	calemmer	lol that is a pretty good one
