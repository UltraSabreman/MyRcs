2013-01-19 13:02:42	cdaringe	hi tutors, anyone in today?
2013-01-19 13:05:15	@krinkle	cdaringe: what can we help you with?
2013-01-19 13:05:40	@krinkle	(It's best to ask your question and if someone is around who is qualified to help, they will)
2013-01-19 13:07:38	cdaringe	hey krinkle:  thanks for the tip.  an elementary issue i'm sure.  i've created a struct w/ various char arrays. char x[], char y[], etc etc.  when i instantiate an instance of that struct in my main and strcpy() local char arrays into that struct, it seems to be copying the new char array into both x[] & y[]
2013-01-19 13:09:06	@krinkle	Can you give a snippet of how you are copying the char arrays into the struct?
2013-01-19 13:14:08	cdaringe	krinkle: http://pastebin.com/k1Dteusc
2013-01-19 13:14:22	cdaringe	please disregard the comments!
2013-01-19 13:15:49	cdaringe	cleaned it up a little: http://pastebin.com/7Q9ELHeN
2013-01-19 13:23:17	@krinkle	The char arrays in your struct need to be either statically allocated by giving a size inside the [] or dynamically allocated using the syntax char * x; and then using the new operator before your string copy.
2013-01-19 13:24:16	@krinkle	I'm not quite sure why this caused all the members to get the same value, but in my tests fixing that fixed the problem.
2013-01-19 13:24:36	+rueckerc	(gdb) print dat1.x
2013-01-19 13:24:37	+rueckerc	$4 = 0x7fffffffe64f "function"
2013-01-19 13:24:37	+rueckerc	(gdb) print dat1.y
2013-01-19 13:24:37	+rueckerc	$5 = 0x7fffffffe64f "function"
2013-01-19 13:24:37	+rueckerc	(gdb) print dat1.z
2013-01-19 13:24:39	+rueckerc	$6 = 0x7fffffffe64f "function"
2013-01-19 13:24:44	+rueckerc	pretty weird
2013-01-19 13:25:03	+rueckerc	they all get the same address
2013-01-19 13:25:52	@krinkle	Yeah, I'd be interested if someone had an explanation for that.
2013-01-19 13:25:54	cdaringe	yea.  OK, thanks rueckerc.  i'll just define char*s
2013-01-19 13:46:55	nibalizer	arstu/win 65
2013-01-19 15:09:49	phat-pat	so ive never used 'this' before
2013-01-19 15:10:29	phat-pat	if i use 'this' in a regular function inside of a class
2013-01-19 15:10:53	phat-pat	its a pointer to the class object correct?
2013-01-19 15:11:39	phat-pat	c++
2013-01-19 15:14:50	@krinkle	yes, if 'this' is used inside a class member function
2013-01-19 15:15:55	phat-pat	thanks
2013-01-19 15:25:39	phat-pat	weird question: if i pass 'this' to myself my reference can i delete myself or is that really bad?
2013-01-19 15:30:16	@krinkle	what is "myself"? A class?
2013-01-19 15:30:37	@krinkle	I don't think you can delete a class using this, nor would I think you would want to

2013-01-19 15:32:05	@krinkle	actually I'm wrong: http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/delete-this.html
2013-01-19 15:35:56	jesusaurus	you can 'delete this'?
2013-01-19 15:36:04	phat-pat	aparently
2013-01-19 15:37:16	jesusaurus	that just seems so wrong
2013-01-19 15:37:29	jesusaurus	im going to say that its legal but not moral
2013-01-19 15:39:12	phat-pat	it seems like it could have practical applications
2013-01-19 15:39:28	phat-pat	but it could definitly be confusing

2013-01-20 22:28:53	blkperl	User326: Hi, are you stuck on a particular part?
2013-01-20 22:29:22	blkperl	I'm not sure I understand the question either.
2013-01-20 22:33:55	User326	yes I am. By any chance have you looked at cs 161 assignment 2? Just curious so I know how fully I need to explain.
2013-01-20 22:36:14	User326	If you haven't heres a link https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5e4feegg5b0M19RNXUzVElpSGs/edit
2013-01-20 22:42:44	blkperl	User326: looking
2013-01-20 22:43:56	blkperl	User326: alright have you written a program that grabs input from a user yet?
2013-01-20 22:45:08	User326	not really.  Heres what I got so far for the program Milage=10000 TMilage=0 Gallon=0 CityCount=0 TGallon=0 CityName=input ("Enter City Name ") while(CityCount <2 ):     TMilage= int(input("Enter Milage"))     TMilage=TMilage-Milage     Gallon=int(input("Enter Gallon"))     TGallon=TGallon+Gallon     print("MPG: ", TMilage/Gallon)     CityCount = CityCount+1     CityName = input("Enter City Name") AvgMPG= TMilage/TGallon print("Overall MPG:",AvgMPG)
2013-01-20 22:46:01	blkperl	User326: ummm, you probably shouldn't have done that, Academic Integrity and that
2013-01-20 22:46:21	blkperl	also we use services like pastebin instead of pastebin for errors and such
2013-01-20 22:46:38	blkperl	err services like pastebin instead of pasting in the channel
2013-01-20 22:46:46	User326	ooo sorry I never used this before.
2013-01-20 22:47:29	blkperl	alright,  so you have a program, which part are you stuck on?
2013-01-20 22:47:50	blkperl	also Welcome to IRC
2013-01-20 22:48:15	User326	Thanks. :] I'm stuck on 5 and 6
2013-01-20 22:52:49	blkperl	User326: um so your loop needs to keep going until the user enters all done according to the assignment
2013-01-20 22:54:41	blkperl	User326: you might want to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop
2013-01-20 22:54:51	blkperl	should make more sense after that on what you need to do
2013-01-20 22:55:32	User326	what about #5?
2013-01-20 22:56:44	User326	for the mpg for two fill ups?
2013-01-20 22:58:33	blkperl	right, so each time you loop calculate that
2013-01-20 22:59:31	User326	thats what I tried to do, but I didn't get how too. I could only do it for each
2013-01-20 23:00:46	blkperl	User326: I think you need to read up on loops some more then, I don't know how to explain more without giving away the answer
2013-01-20 23:01:29	blkperl	have you tried trying to figure it out with english sentences first?
2013-01-20 23:01:48	blkperl	then progressing to pseudo code
2013-01-20 23:02:15	User326	hmm no idea what that means?
2013-01-20 23:03:25	User326	you mean write each step on the chart and then make code for it?
2013-01-20 23:03:33	blkperl	for example while( not done with user input) do; calculations done;
2013-01-20 23:04:52	blkperl	well in this case : while (not done) { ask for input ; print things; add up the input and calculate MPG with value from last time;
2013-01-20 23:05:13	blkperl	now turn that into some python code ^
2013-01-20 23:05:51	User326	hmmm thats different. I can try.
2013-01-20 23:07:39	blkperl	let me know if you get stuck
2013-01-20 23:07:57	blkperl	and I'll try to think of more creative ways to explain this :)
2013-01-20 23:10:53	User326	awww thanks :] I think with me I understand the concept, but like the details of it. Like for the loop I understand it's telling what to while true until false, but I don't know specifics. Do you think you can ask me questions so I come to the answer? That way you don't tell me the answer.
2013-01-20 23:13:12	User326	I know my loop is only set for 2 cities
2013-01-20 23:13:21	User326	which means I need to set it to an all done
2013-01-20 23:16:40	User326	and I know if I set it the loop the !="quit" it goes on for ever never ending it
2013-01-20 23:17:19	User326	so I need an in between something that will make the statement false to end it
2013-01-20 23:19:25	User326	oh wait i got it! :D
2013-01-20 23:19:34	User326	well at least the first part of it
2013-01-20 23:20:06	User326	I set the city name to to all done and it worked, but I didn't get the mpg for 2 cities
2013-01-20 23:21:36	User326	So now I need to do the MPG for every second one  after the first one which means it need to be looped
2013-01-20 23:21:45	User326	can you have a loop within a loop?
2013-01-20 23:26:04	dondon	there's actaully no limit to how many loops are in a loop
2013-01-20 23:26:12	dondon	so yes
2013-01-20 23:28:12	User326	hmmm I'm still stuck on how you would say it's every other to tell the MPG after the first one
2013-01-20 23:28:32	blkperl	User326: so your entering cities like this right "(1) portland: mpg is 5", "(2) seattle: mpg is 2", "(3) LA: mpg is 3" and you need you calculate the difference between 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 right?
2013-01-20 23:30:31	blkperl	so you have 2 cases
2013-01-20 23:30:44	blkperl	1 city, or more than one city
2013-01-20 23:31:04	dondon	but never the difference between 1 & 3 right?
2013-01-20 23:31:15	User326	Kind of your way is more simple. we have to enter the milage, then subtract the milage, then /the gallons to get the mpg. I know I'm almost there, because I can do it for each. After the mpg is calculated for the first one then every other one.
2013-01-20 23:31:53	User326	After the first mpg is calculated then it's every other one. So the first destination, the 3rd, the 5th etc.
2013-01-20 23:32:48	blkperl	are you sure? I don't think it specifies every other city
2013-01-20 23:33:19	blkperl	city a -> city b -> city c -> city d, I think you just need to calculate the difference as you move between them
2013-01-20 23:34:00	User326	not really sure. it says "display the mpg between two fill ups until the user enters all done"
2013-01-20 23:34:20	User326	oh man you may be right
2013-01-20 23:34:30	blkperl	yeah I think it means the mpg between the current fill up and the previous fill up :D
2013-01-20 23:34:38	User326	THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
2013-01-20 23:35:39	blkperl	:)
2013-01-20 23:35:42	User326	You have no idea. I was wondering what were they talking about, but now it makes sense! Again Thank you! I really appreciate it! :D
2013-01-20 23:36:12	blkperl	this is why IRC is awesome
2013-01-20 23:37:32	User326	Yes I agree! I didn't think I had any hope since school is closed, but I wanted to try. Have an AMAZING rest of the week! Goodnight. :]

2013-01-21 19:42:59	phat-pat	so if im creating an object of a derived class, do i have to explicitly call the parent's constructor in the init list or is that done automatically?
2013-01-21 19:45:45	@krinkle	I believe it is automatic.
2013-01-21 19:47:42	phat-pat	thanks
2013-01-21 19:47:59	phat-pat	is the same true for copy constructors?

2013-01-21 19:52:02	@krinkle	copy constructors don't automatically call their parent's copy constructor. see karla's notes on it: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS202_Slides/Topic3.pdf (slides 39 and 40)

2013-01-21 21:15:22	bowzr	hi im trying some new things with object oriented programming and im having a little issue. Im trying to create a class whos data members include an array of objects of another class. I need to send a default value into the constructer of the class of which there will be six of, but i cant seem to find the right syntax. After a little testing, i have found (with a dynamically allocated array) when i run the command "person * group; group = new person[6];
2013-01-21 21:20:10	bowzr	this is the code im trying http://pastie.org/5803676
2013-01-21 21:21:01	bowzr	im trying to send in a value for p
2013-01-21 21:33:20	@krinkle	Interesting question. A little googling tells me that there's no good way to call a non-default destructor when dynamically allocating an array of objects. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2409819/c-constructor-initializer-for-arrays
2013-01-21 21:33:47	@krinkle	So you could make person::person() set a default value of, say 0, but you couldn't pass in an argument to the constructor.
2013-01-21 21:42:22	bowzr	i see. i came up with an alternative while i was waiting for an answer. If interested here is the code : http://pastie.org/5804683
2013-01-21 21:42:28	bowzr	and thanks

2013-01-21 22:45:55	MaddHatter	that c++0x syntax is confusing.. what happens if you want to invoke a constructor with 2 args instead of 1?

2013-01-24 22:52:51	Aziz	Hello, is anyone here willing to help me in some homework troubles?
2013-01-24 22:53:50	haus	what class is it for?
2013-01-24 22:54:07	Aziz	CS 161, basic stuff for most people here I guess.
2013-01-24 22:54:20	haus	what's the assignment and what are you having trouble with?
2013-01-24 22:55:03	Aziz	Well, we are supposed to write a program that calculates miles per gallon, here is the assignment for more info
2013-01-24 22:55:03	Aziz	http://moodle.svcs.cs.pdx.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=366
2013-01-24 22:55:54	jesusaurus	what problem are you running in to?
2013-01-24 22:56:18	Aziz	when I calculate the mpg of the first city, everything goes well, but once I get to another city, the program calculates the total mpg instead of the mpg for that leg only for some reason
2013-01-24 22:57:11	haus	so to get the mpg for the second leg what information do you need?
2013-01-24 22:58:02	Aziz	Well, as the assignment stated, the start mileage is 10000
2013-01-24 22:58:29	haus	Aziz: if you were calculating it using pen and paper, what would you do?
2013-01-24 22:58:34	Aziz	oh,
2013-01-24 22:59:19	Aziz	I'd subtract the mileage shown in the odometer from the previous mileage then divide it by the amount of gallons required to fill up the tank
2013-01-24 23:00:48	haus	okay, so is that what your program is doing?
2013-01-24 23:01:28	haus	(i mean obviously not if you aren't seeing that behavior)
2013-01-24 23:02:19	haus	so your program needs to have the prev mileage and the current mileage and the gallons used to fill up to get the correct mpg, right?
2013-01-24 23:05:43	Aziz	correct, I am now able to tell that the program is subtracting the mileage I enter by 10000, it works in the first leg but doesn't in the second leg since I think it's not using the previous mileage but subtracting by 10000 each time
2013-01-24 23:06:00	Aziz	but I am not really sure how to make it use the previous mileage each time
2013-01-24 23:07:26	haus	well in the second leg, the previous mileage should still be stored in a variable (from the previous leg), so you should be able to assign it to another variable to use alongside the new mileage
2013-01-24 23:09:20	Aziz	yes but I can't really figure out how to do that, so in the first leg I can just subtract it by 10000, it's easy doing it manually but I can't really think of a way of setting a variable that can take care of that in every loop sequence  :|
2013-01-24 23:11:40	haus	in the scope of the problem, what does 10000 represent?
2013-01-24 23:12:38	Aziz	10000 represents the mileage shown on their car before going on the road trip.
2013-01-24 23:12:56	haus	okay, what does it represent in the first leg of the trip
2013-01-24 23:13:46	Aziz	the previous mileage
2013-01-24 23:13:55	haus	right
2013-01-24 23:14:32	haus	so in any leg, you have the previous mileage, the current mileage, and the gallons filled up
2013-01-24 23:14:42	Aziz	Yes.
2013-01-24 23:15:21	haus	the first leg, previous mileage is 10000
2013-01-24 23:15:39	Aziz	Yes
2013-01-24 23:15:51	haus	the second leg, the previous mileage is the current milegage of the first leg
2013-01-24 23:18:51	haus	are you using variables in your mpg calculation or hard coded to 10000?
2013-01-24 23:19:22	Aziz	I am using a variable but within it is 10000
2013-01-24 23:19:37	haus	you don't ever set it to anything else?
2013-01-24 23:21:24	Aziz	not really, no, I am using variable to do the operation but within that variable is a variable that is represents 10000
2013-01-24 23:21:57	haus	so at the beginning of your loop (i assume you're looping) if there isn't a current mileage from a previous loop, then the prev mileage is 10000, otherwise the previous mileage is the current mileage of the previous loop
2013-01-24 23:23:02	Aziz	I understand that what the program is doing, is using the 10000 every time, but I don't know how to make it use the previous mileage everytime
2013-01-24 23:24:17	haus	did the last thing i said help at all?
2013-01-24 23:24:39	Aziz	it did, but can I give you an idea on what am I supposed to do?
2013-01-24 23:24:45	Aziz	can I set it to
2013-01-24 23:25:10	Aziz	after the first loop I initiate another loop that will keep using the mileage calculated
2013-01-24 23:26:18	Aziz	and can you please clarify what you said in the last line, starting from "otherwise…."
2013-01-24 23:27:07	haus	in the second time through your loop, the mileage entered by the user the first time is still stored in a variable and can be reassigned
2013-01-24 23:27:14	haus	that's what i meant
2013-01-24 23:28:29	Aziz	that's what my program is supposed to do, but it isn't doing that due to me not knowing how to assign a variable that keeps track of the mileage of every loop and using it as it goes on
2013-01-24 23:30:11	haus	okay, so here's an example...first run, i drive 1200 miles and buy 30 gallons of gas
2013-01-24 23:30:54	haus	so i've entered 11200 as the odometer reading, right?
2013-01-24 23:31:52	haus	so if there's a variable, call it starting_mileage, then it is 10000 for this loop, and another variable, ending_mileage is 11200 for this loop
2013-01-24 23:32:13	haus	next loop, first thing that happens is starting_mileage = ending_mileage
2013-01-24 23:32:24	haus	now starting_mileage is set to 11200
2013-01-24 23:32:44	haus	if i enter 13000 as the new odometer reading, ending_mileage gets set to 11200
2013-01-24 23:32:48	haus	er
2013-01-24 23:32:57	haus	sorry, ending_mileage gets set to 13000
2013-01-24 23:33:45	Aziz	Oh, I think I am starting to get it now
2013-01-24 23:35:02	haus	the tricky part is the first loop when you don't have an ending mileage to set it to. you could initialize ending_mileage to 10000 right before the loop so that the first time around starting_mileage = ending_mileage = 10000
2013-01-24 23:36:52	haus	and now i'm gonna head to bed. good night
2013-01-24 23:39:03	Aziz	Thank you very much hans!
2013-01-24 23:39:06	Aziz	haus*
2013-01-24 23:39:28	Aziz	Good night, I am very grateful for your help, and sorry for my stupidity lol.
2013-01-24 23:39:57	haus	Aziz: everyone starts somewhere. better to ask for help and figure it out then not.
2013-01-24 23:40:01	haus	and happy to help
2013-01-24 23:40:34	Aziz	That's true, and again, thank you very much, I have 20 minutes till deadline I am hoping I can finish it in time!

2013-01-26 16:05:57	phat-pat	does anybody know whats going on here?
2013-01-26 16:06:14	phat-pat	http://i.imgur.com/XGJL69c.jpg
2013-01-26 16:06:36	phat-pat	im really confused
2013-01-26 16:10:15	phat-pat	o nvm i was redeclaring i
2013-01-26 18:25:14	phat-pat	so
2013-01-26 18:25:33	phat-pat	 this very simple function is segfaulting
2013-01-26 18:25:37	phat-pat	http://pastebin.com/cNn9VuAc
2013-01-26 18:25:55	phat-pat	and i cant figure out why
2013-01-26 18:26:01	phat-pat	any ideas?
2013-01-26 18:31:42	@krinkle	Are you setting left and right to be null in your bst_node constructor?
2013-01-26 18:38:48	phat-pat	yea. its weird cuz i double checked everything i normally mess
2013-01-26 18:38:50	phat-pat	up
2013-01-26 18:39:29	phat-pat	the only thing i can think of is if the memory is getting corrupted by an error somewhere else
2013-01-26 18:40:55	phat-pat	when i print the variable in question its not 0
2013-01-26 18:41:05	phat-pat	but still inaccessable
2013-01-26 18:41:19	phat-pat	so maybe im deleting it somehow?
2013-01-26 18:43:16	@krinkle	Possibly? If you delete a node you should set its parent's left or right pointer to be null
2013-01-26 18:44:37	phat-pat	i dont think thats it cuz i dont even have a delete function
2013-01-26 18:47:16	@krinkle	Hmm, I don't have much else to offer. Somehow your left or right pointer either wasn't set to null to begin with or got unset.
2013-01-26 18:47:38	@krinkle	Walking through it with gdb might help.
2013-01-26 18:47:43	phat-pat	yea its a weird thing
2013-01-26 18:47:55	phat-pat	i will try that and see what happens
2013-01-26 18:47:58	phat-pat	thanks
2013-01-26 19:53:29	kini	phat-pat: how have you declared left and right?

2013-01-29 23:38:48	blkperl	loon: hello
2013-01-29 23:39:42	loon	can anyone help me understand a bitwise issue in c?
2013-01-29 23:40:26	blkperl	loon: we can try, whats the problem
2013-01-29 23:41:16	loon	well i am in cs201 we have an assignment that requires finding Tmin
2013-01-29 23:41:35	loon	it has to be done in under 10 operations
2013-01-29 23:41:42	loon	i did it in 11
2013-01-29 23:42:06	loon	i can't wrap my head around how it could do it in less
2013-01-29 23:49:47	kini	what is Tmin?
2013-01-29 23:51:04	loon	its the smallest two complement number the hardware can show in a 32 bit register
2013-01-29 23:52:17	kini	so, all 1s?
2013-01-29 23:53:28	kini	er, sorry :P I mean, 1 followed by 31 0s
2013-01-29 23:54:05	loon	yeah
2013-01-29 23:55:28	kini	so... what stops you from just doing the following:
2013-01-29 23:55:38	kini	uint32_t x = 0x80000000;
2013-01-29 23:55:56	loon	the rules
2013-01-29 23:56:03	kini	so what are all the rules
2013-01-29 23:56:36	loon	i can't set any value larger than 0xFF
2013-01-29 23:56:59	kini	and you can only use 10 "operations", what are operations defined as
2013-01-29 23:58:38	MaddHatter	would reinterpret_cast be cheating?
2013-01-29 23:59:02	kini	loon says in PM:
2013-01-29 23:59:02	kini	<loon>  * isTmin - returns 1 if x is the minimum, two's complement number,
2013-01-29 23:59:02	kini	<loon>  *     and 0 otherwise
2013-01-29 23:59:02	kini	<loon>  *   Legal ops: ! ~ & ^ | +
2013-01-29 23:59:02	kini	<loon>  *   Max ops: 10
2013-01-29 23:59:04	kini	<loon>  *   Rating: 1
2013-01-29 23:59:07	kini	dunno what "rating" is
2013-01-29 23:59:38	loon	rating is the weight the problem is
2013-01-29 23:59:52	loon	its a lower valued puzzle
2013-01-29 23:59:58	MaddHatter	so = isn't allowed? Nor "if"?
2013-01-30 00:00:07	kini	meaning it's easy, or it's difficult?
2013-01-30 00:00:10	MaddHatter	nor any sequence points, apparently
2013-01-30 00:00:32	loon	the ratings are 1 or 2 points
2013-01-30 00:00:44	 *	nameless wanted <<
2013-01-30 00:01:12	loon	the one worth 2 i beat within 10 minutes of starting the assignment
2013-01-30 00:01:14	 *	kini wanted -
2013-01-30 00:01:17	MaddHatter	I was going to return ((input+1)<input) || ((input-1)<input)
2013-01-30 00:01:26	MaddHatter	or inverse of that or whatever
2013-01-30 00:01:37	kini	MaddHatter: that returns true for the max value as well
2013-01-30 00:01:40	MaddHatter	but if || and < and > and ( and ) aren't allowed... :-(
2013-01-30 00:01:47	blkperl	bzr-- is so slow....
2013-01-30 00:01:59	kini	the function is only supposed to check for the minimum, so "return input - 1 > input;" would be correct
2013-01-30 00:02:03	MaddHatter	kini: check for sign change then or something. I didn't really think about it much.
2013-01-30 00:02:12	kini	blkperl: but it's the *official* GNU VCS!
2013-01-30 00:02:27	MaddHatter	what does GNU have against git?
2013-01-30 00:02:33	kini	who knows
2013-01-30 00:02:42	MaddHatter	although to be fair, if you're used to git, _everything_ is slow
2013-01-30 00:02:51	kini	the *official* GNU scripting language is Guile Scheme
2013-01-30 00:03:01	kini	so I don't think their choices have much to do with popularity
2013-01-30 00:03:03	nameless	Because git comes from linus, and RMS doesn't like the linus.
2013-01-30 00:03:04	MaddHatter	naturally. It (also) starts with G
2013-01-30 00:03:46	blkperl	too bad the launchpad intergration with bzr is really intergrated.....
2013-01-30 00:03:52	blkperl	i would much prefer git
2013-01-30 00:03:53	loon	the operators -, >, are not allowed
2013-01-30 00:04:06	blkperl	like 31k/s is unacceptable
2013-01-30 00:04:10	 *	nameless doesn't really think you need -
2013-01-30 00:04:23	nameless	Well, you might if you don't have <<
2013-01-30 00:04:49	loon	i don't have -, <,>,>>,<<
2013-01-30 00:05:07	loon	just ! ~ & ^ | +
2013-01-30 00:05:33	loon	and a limit of 10 operators
2013-01-30 00:05:38	kini	no if statements?
2013-01-30 00:05:41	kini	no == ?
2013-01-30 00:05:43	loon	nope
2013-01-30 00:05:54	MaddHatter	and no ()s?
2013-01-30 00:05:56	loon	i did it in 11
2013-01-30 00:05:56	kini	oh
2013-01-30 00:06:17	loon	you can use ()
2013-01-30 00:06:26	loon	that are not considered operators
2013-01-30 00:12:56	MaddHatter	what is the canonical result of ~0 + 1?

2013-01-30 01:08:40	MaddHatter	how can you avoid literals (at least 0 or 1)?
2013-01-30 01:09:10	kini	!!x for non-negative x; formula happens to still work for x = 0 for other reasons
2013-01-30 01:09:32	MaddHatter	yeah, getting it to return false on 0 took up 3 operations all on its own
2013-01-30 01:13:57	kini	false alarm, my solution was broken
2013-01-30 01:16:02	kini	double false alarm, avoiding literals actually fixes my solution. So I guess I have it in 6 lol

2013-01-31 15:20:28	phat-pat	if i return a pointer by reference can i change where its pointing to?
2013-01-31 15:21:52	phat-pat	say i hav data * ptr = c.f(); where c.f returns a pointer by ref
2013-01-31 15:22:42	phat-pat	will saying ptr = some_other_pointer; change where the original pointer stored in c is pointing?
2013-01-31 15:42:34	+lpl	your pointer that is getting the return from the function should actually be of type ** (Pointer to a pointer). When you return &x where x was a pointer type, what you are actually returning is the memory location of that pointer.

2013-01-31 16:29:43	+rueckerc	correct

2013-01-31 18:02:26	phat-pat	assignment2.cpp:298:16: error: cannot call constructor ‘m_node::m_node’ directly [-fpermissive]
2013-01-31 18:02:38	phat-pat	anybody know what this means?
2013-01-31 18:03:18	phat-pat	here is my constructor:

2013-01-31 18:03:50	phat-pat	i have the same issue on one other constructor ass well
2013-01-31 18:18:05	phat-pat	its complaining about where i define the function
2013-01-31 18:18:14	phat-pat	but the code seems fine...
2013-01-31 18:22:43	phat-pat	seems...
2013-01-31 18:24:13	phat-pat	ok weird, turns out i was missing a paren in some random spot
2013-01-31 18:24:46	phat-pat	wait that didnt fix it

2013-02-02 23:01:33	User111	hello, anyone there?
2013-02-02 23:01:37	User111	i have a python question
2013-02-02 23:01:57	User111	here's my question:
2013-02-02 23:01:58	User111	it's probably really easy
2013-02-02 23:02:27	User111	hello?
2013-02-02 23:03:50	haus	python
2013-02-02 23:05:39	kini	User111: don't ask to ask, just ask
2013-02-02 23:12:52	haus	also. python
2013-02-02 23:13:09	User111	okay, i'm trying to make this code work:
2013-02-02 23:13:11	User111	 x=("What color is your hair?") j=(input(x))  print (Sandra's hair is)\n  y=("Sandra has brown hair") print (y[0:10], y[17:21])
2013-02-02 23:14:24	User111	wait, actually, i want to say
2013-02-02 23:14:33	User111	after prompting user for sandra's hair color
2013-02-02 23:14:46	kini	1) what's with all the parentheses
2013-02-02 23:14:53	kini	2) don't forget to put all literal strings inside quotation marks
2013-02-02 23:15:21	User111	what's a literal string?
2013-02-02 23:15:42	User111	i'm using paren like i would in math
2013-02-02 23:15:43	User111	whops
2013-02-02 23:16:38	kini	usually it's fine to do that, but you're going to run into trouble if you enclose things with commas in parentheses because that refers to a different kind of thing, a tuple
2013-02-02 23:16:50	User111	okay, i'm working on tuples now
2013-02-02 23:17:07	User111	i thought the difference between tuples and lists is that tuples use square brackets
2013-02-02 23:17:09	kini	a literal string is when you have some text in your program that's not part of the program but is a value, which you want to do something with
2013-02-02 23:17:09	User111	right?
2013-02-02 23:17:17	kini	no, tuples use () and lists use []
2013-02-02 23:17:25	User111	oh wow i had it backwards
2013-02-02 23:17:28	User111	thanks!
2013-02-02 23:17:49	kini	for example in your program, the text "What color is your hair?" is not part of the program because the python interpreter doesn't try to interpret it
2013-02-02 23:17:56	kini	it is just one packaged up value, i.e. a string
2013-02-02 23:18:01	kini	and you set the variable x to that value
2013-02-02 23:18:08	User111	so back to problem with my "sandra's hair" prompt
2013-02-02 23:18:09	User111	okay
2013-02-02 23:18:19	kini	whereas you don't have "Sandra's hair is" in quotation marks
2013-02-02 23:18:25	kini	so the interpreter will try to run it as python code
2013-02-02 23:20:04	User111	 x=("What color is your hair?") j=(input(x))  print "Sandra's hair is" "j"
2013-02-02 23:20:22	User111	and i still get a syntax error
2013-02-02 23:21:29	kini	first of all I hope those statements are all on separate lines?
2013-02-02 23:21:40	User111	yes
2013-02-02 23:21:59	kini	which line is the syntax error on?
2013-02-02 23:22:28	User111	oh wow i fixed it
2013-02-02 23:22:53	User111	but now i need to make sure that the printed line is on one line
2013-02-02 23:22:57	User111	What color is your hair?green Sandra's hair is green
2013-02-02 23:23:18	User111	the last word "green" is on a different line than "Sandra's hair"
2013-02-02 23:24:15	kini	well, if you fixed it, I assume that means you changed your code
2013-02-02 23:24:24	kini	so until you tell me what your code looks like now, I can't offer an opinion :)
2013-02-02 23:24:44	User111	x=("What color is your hair?")
2013-02-02 23:24:54	User111	j=(input(x))
2013-02-02 23:25:03	User111	print ("Sandra's hair is:")
2013-02-02 23:25:17	User111	print(j)
2013-02-02 23:25:32	kini	ok, how I would do it is this
2013-02-02 23:25:35	kini	replace the last two lines with:
2013-02-02 23:25:46	kini	print("Sandra's hair is:" + j)
2013-02-02 23:25:54	kini	you can concatenate strings together with +
2013-02-02 23:26:01	kini	and that avoids adding line breaks
2013-02-02 23:26:01	User111	how could i improve this code syntax?
2013-02-02 23:26:19	kini	are you writing for Python 2 or Python 3?
2013-02-02 23:27:14	User111	3.2
2013-02-02 23:27:17	User111	3.2
2013-02-02 23:28:45	kini	here's what I would write: http://bpaste.net/show/3O7PEc6TnZTSeYmiowHw/
2013-02-02 23:29:47	kini	wait, that might not work
2013-02-02 23:29:48	 *	kini sighs
2013-02-02 23:29:53	kini	let me get out my actual computer...
2013-02-02 23:32:17	kini	ah
2013-02-02 23:32:35	kini	you probably want to use raw_input() instead of input()
2013-02-02 23:32:49	kini	input() expects you to type in python code more or less
2013-02-02 23:32:57	kini	whereas raw_input() expects you to type in a string literal
2013-02-02 23:33:43	User111	hmmm
2013-02-02 23:33:56	kini	so, this is what I would write: http://bpaste.net/show/AqOnsesIFgwWWQBDpJYw/
2013-02-02 23:34:01	User111	we haven't learned about the difference in raw_input and input in class
2013-02-02 23:34:10	kini	hmm
2013-02-02 23:34:12	User111	okay i'll read what's on this link - thanks
2013-02-02 23:34:23	kini	oops
2013-02-02 23:34:28	kini	you're using python3
2013-02-02 23:34:29	kini	they changed it
2013-02-02 23:34:37	kini	what I said first should work fine then
2013-02-02 23:35:02	kini	sorry about that haha
2013-02-02 23:35:14	kini	so just print("Sandra's hair is: " + input("What color is your hair?"))
2013-02-02 23:35:48	User111	so that eliminates the need for all of my variables
2013-02-02 23:35:48	User111	:)
2013-02-02 23:35:50	User111	yay
2013-02-02 23:36:05	kini	or, print("Sandra's hair is: " + input("What color is your hair?\n")) if you want the cursor to be on a new line when asking you to type the hair color
2013-02-02 23:40:43	User111	cool
2013-02-02 23:43:18	User111	okay i'm on another problem now
2013-02-02 23:43:23	User111	it's chapter 4 question 1
2013-02-02 23:43:45	User111	i'm trying to use the range module to write a program that counts for the user
2013-02-02 23:44:01	User111	the user enters a starting number, ending number, and an interval to count by
2013-02-02 23:45:17	User111	and i get this error at the end: str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
2013-02-02 23:45:33	User111	i'm confused about when i have to specify string or integer
2013-02-02 23:46:24	User111	okay here's the code
2013-02-02 23:46:38	User111	i=input(int("Enter starting number"))
2013-02-02 23:46:45	User111	j=input(int("Enter ending number"))
2013-02-02 23:46:56	User111	k=input(int("Enter interval"))
2013-02-02 23:47:05	User111	for w in range(i,j,k):
2013-02-02 23:47:12	User111	    print(int(x[w]))
2013-02-02 23:47:58	kini	int() reinterprets an object as an integer
2013-02-02 23:48:10	kini	in your code you're using int() a few times to try to convert strings like "Enter starting number" into integers
2013-02-02 23:48:13	kini	of course, this doesn't make sense
2013-02-02 23:48:23	User111	:(
2013-02-02 23:48:52	User111	hm
2013-02-02 23:49:27	User111	oh! the "int" needs to go tot he left of "input"!!
2013-02-02 23:49:31	User111	i'll try that now
2013-02-02 23:50:30	User111	yay that worked!
2013-02-02 23:50:33	User111	wow thanks a lot
2013-02-02 23:51:06	kini	rather than "to the left", you should think about it as "outside" or "after".
2013-02-02 23:51:14	User111	yes, gotcha
2013-02-02 23:51:16	kini	you're welcome :) though you figured it out by yourself
2013-02-02 23:51:21	User111	:)
2013-02-02 23:51:32	User111	okay now i get this error Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/untitled", line 8, in <module>     print(int(x[w])) NameError: name 'x' is not defined
2013-02-02 23:51:42	User111	this is a problem i get a lot
2013-02-02 23:51:54	User111	i feel like in comp sci, you guys create variables all over the place
2013-02-02 23:52:10	User111	like there are dependent variables that remain dormant all over the place
2013-02-02 23:52:12	kini	are you coming from a mathematics background?
2013-02-02 23:52:13	User111	it's tricky
2013-02-02 23:52:18	User111	yes
2013-02-02 23:52:36	kini	ok, so first of all, this is not really a general computer science thing, it's a particular property of imperative languages
2013-02-02 23:53:04	kini	there are some languages where variables are more similar to mathematical variables (check out Haskell for example)
2013-02-02 23:53:42	kini	rather than thinking of Python variables as variables in the mathematics sense, think of them as names that are temporarily bound to values along the timeline of execution of a program
2013-02-02 23:54:32	User111	oooo
2013-02-02 23:54:34	User111	k
2013-02-02 23:55:15	kini	(I'm from a mathematics background too, sometimes this CS stuff takes a little getting used to :) )
2013-02-02 23:55:24	User111	yeah, for sure
2013-02-02 23:55:40	User111	it's kind of like
2013-02-02 23:55:50	User111	variables "empty out" and can be "refilled" in python
2013-02-02 23:56:00	kini	kind of
2013-02-02 23:56:35	kini	actually in python it's more like there's this big pool of "values" (or "objects" if you want to call them that), and as the program executes, you sometimes attach names to some of them as you go along for convenience
2013-02-02 23:56:56	kini	and of course as the program goes along it may create more objects
2013-02-02 23:57:09	User111	ok
2013-02-02 23:57:14	kini	in Python you typically don't manually delete any of the objects, they just magically get cleaned up when they're not needed anymore
2013-02-02 23:57:29	kini	this is called "garbage collection" and is why Python is referred to as a "garbage-collected language"
2013-02-02 23:57:40	kini	in some languages like C++ you need to manually delete objects
2013-02-03 00:01:10	User111	ok
2013-02-03 00:01:33	User111	so now i'm going back to my "counting for the user" program
2013-02-03 00:03:26	User111	ugh
2013-02-03 00:04:33	User111	i have it all right, but can't get it to print
2013-02-03 00:06:04	User111	this is the last one, i promise
2013-02-03 00:06:07	User111	and then i'll leave you alone
2013-02-03 00:06:26	User111	these are the last two lines of code of the counting program
2013-02-03 00:06:30	User111	for w in range(i,j,k):
2013-02-03 00:06:55	User111	﻿﻿    print(int[w])
2013-02-03 00:07:56	kini	remember that foo[bar] is used to get the bar-th entry of the list foo
2013-02-03 00:08:16	User111	what's foo
2013-02-03 00:08:18	User111	?
2013-02-03 00:08:44	kini	I'm just using that as a placeholder
2013-02-03 00:08:51	kini	foo, bar, and baz are very common placeholder names in CS for some reason
2013-02-03 00:08:57	User111	ok i get it
2013-02-03 00:09:15	User111	u guys love yr lingo
2013-02-03 00:09:55	kini	there's even a wikipedia article about it lol http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable
2013-02-03 00:10:16	User111	lol wow
2013-02-03 00:10:18	User111	that's cool
2013-02-03 00:11:33	User111	k i don't konw why this isn't working for me
2013-02-03 00:12:26	User111	TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable
2013-02-03 00:13:28	kini	yup
2013-02-03 00:13:44	User111	oh maybe i'm using brackets when i need to use paren.
2013-02-03 00:13:45	kini	remember that when you write a[b], you are getting the b-th element of the list a
2013-02-03 00:13:54	kini	so int[w] will get the w-th entry of the list int
2013-02-03 00:14:07	kini	but int is a function that converts things to integers (actually it's the name of the int type)
2013-02-03 00:14:15	kini	hence the error message, 'type' object is not subscriptable
2013-02-03 00:14:24	User111	hmmm
2013-02-03 00:14:28	User111	okay let me see here
2013-02-03 00:14:36	kini	(the [w] part is a subscript, much like how in math you'd write a_i where i is the subscript to refer to the i-th entry in a sequence)
2013-02-03 00:16:00	User111	i got it to work!
2013-02-03 00:17:25	User111	what is w a subscript of?
2013-02-03 00:18:28	kini	int, in your original code
2013-02-03 00:18:29	kini	int[w]
2013-02-03 00:18:41	kini	but int is not a list, hence the error
2013-02-03 00:19:07	User111	and why wouldn't print(x[w]) work but print([w]) would?
2013-02-03 00:19:39	kini	print(x[w]) would work if x were a list and w were an integer so that the interpreter could find the w-th element of the list x
2013-02-03 00:19:48	kini	print([w]) prints a list, [w], which contains a single element, w
2013-02-03 00:20:41	kini	perhaps you are confused by the fact that [] when put next to a value are used to find an element of that value, whereas [] by themselves are used to create a list by listing elements inside them
2013-02-03 00:20:49	kini	a[3] is the third element of the list a
2013-02-03 00:20:54	kini	[3] is a list containing one element, the number 3
2013-02-03 00:21:10	kini	["Hello", "world"] is a list containing two elements, namely the string "Hello" and the string "world"
2013-02-03 00:21:25	kini	a["Hello"] is an error because it doesn't make sense to find the "Hello"-th element of the list a
2013-02-03 00:23:13	User111	okay, that makes a lot of sense
2013-02-03 00:24:13	User111	and the list is wrapped up inside the module "list()" so long as you provide the start, end, and interval values
2013-02-03 00:24:42	kini	I'm not sure what you mean by 'the module "list()"'
2013-02-03 00:25:06	User111	oh, i mean the list function
2013-02-03 00:25:58	User111	lists use [ ] not ( )
2013-02-03 00:26:42	User111	okay, so if i want my list to print out horizontally, not ina  collumn, is that possible?
2013-02-03 00:33:12	User111	okay, i can't get the ".join" thing to work now
2013-02-03 00:33:16	User111	but gtg sleep now
2013-02-03 00:33:21	User111	thanks a TON you've been super helpful
2013-02-03 00:33:41	User111	have a great weekend

2013-02-03 16:04:22	bpostman	I'm not really sure, it's just a C library
2013-02-03 16:04:28	bpostman	and it's QtCreator, not just Qt?

2013-02-03 21:07:49	User048	can you tell me how to ask the computer to determine if the ord of a letter is even or odd?
2013-02-03 21:07:54	User048	i'm in CS161 python
2013-02-03 21:10:17	User048	hello?
2013-02-03 21:10:33	@krinkle	what is the ord of a letter?
2013-02-03 21:11:01	User048	for example, A=1
2013-02-03 21:11:04	User048	B=2
2013-02-03 21:11:48	User048	#  Can find out the code of a character with ord(): ord('h') == 104, ord('⁋') == 8267 #
2013-02-03 21:13:08	User048	i want to say "For each number divisible by 2, replace with "."
2013-02-03 21:13:14	User048	but i don't know how to translate that into python
2013-02-03 21:13:25	User048	then i can make a loop and get my program to start looping
2013-02-03 21:15:06	User048	i'm getting really frustrated with this class - i go to all the lectures, read all of the book, search online for python codes, and still i don't know how to do anything
2013-02-03 21:15:21	User048	it's obviously a very slow learning process (for me)
2013-02-03 21:17:13	@krinkle	What I think you are looking for is the mod operator, or the '%'
2013-02-03 21:17:20	@krinkle	have you learned about that in class?
2013-02-03 21:17:52	User048	no
2013-02-03 21:18:37	Racoon	I also have to ask, are you doing this for characters (such as letters and symbols) or just integers?
2013-02-03 21:18:45	User048	for characters
2013-02-03 21:19:11	Racoon	and at this point you can succesfully attin the character code for ech letter?
2013-02-03 21:19:45	Racoon	cause I agree with krinkle that the mod operator is probably your best bet
2013-02-03 21:20:27	User048	#input a string, then print that string with every character with an even #character code change to '.'.
2013-02-03 21:21:29	User048	okay, i'm working on learning out to attach character codes for each number
2013-02-03 21:21:33	User048	i mean for each letter
2013-02-03 21:21:39	User048	:P
2013-02-03 21:22:18	Racoon	there are two major steps to solving the problem before you
2013-02-03 21:22:25	User048	yes
2013-02-03 21:22:31	User048	okay, here's what i have now
2013-02-03 21:22:32	Racoon	1: identify the ascii value ascociated with the character
2013-02-03 21:22:52	Racoon	2: using modulus to identify whether that cose id even
2013-02-03 21:23:17	User048	i=input("Enter a string")
2013-02-03 21:23:26	User048	number = ord(input)
2013-02-03 21:23:35	Racoon	awesome
2013-02-03 21:23:35	User048	For number %2:
2013-02-03 21:23:43	User048	 print(".")
2013-02-03 21:24:01	User048	python doesn't like my "number" label
2013-02-03 21:26:55	Racoon	would you mind making a link on pastbin so we can see how you have it all arranged? http://pastebin.com/
2013-02-03 21:27:04	User048	okay
2013-02-03 21:27:54	User048	did you get it?
2013-02-03 21:27:58	Racoon	maybe I'll see why it doesn't compile (python isn't my primary language)
2013-02-03 21:28:08	User048	cool cool
2013-02-03 21:28:31	Racoon	heh, no, you have to paste it in there and then it should make you a link that you can paste here
2013-02-03 21:30:01	Racoon	as in once you paste your code, and hit submit, you can copy the contents of the address bar for others to see what you have posted

2013-02-03 21:34:47	Racoon	mkay, so right off the bat I get the feeling that your for loop is a little bare, check out this site: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_for_loop.htm
2013-02-03 21:35:43	User048	k i'm reading that
2013-02-03 21:35:56	Racoon	what you are trying to do is analyze each letter of the input
2013-02-03 21:36:33	Racoon	so you canuse a for loop like (for letter in input) to apply commands to each letter
2013-02-03 21:36:48	Racoon	1: get the input
2013-02-03 21:36:57	Racoon	2: enter for loop looking at each letter
2013-02-03 21:37:10	Racoon	3: in the for loop get the ord(letter)
2013-02-03 21:37:34	Racoon	4: if (mod 2) then print '.'
2013-02-03 21:37:44	Racoon	   else print letter
2013-02-03 21:38:46	User048	oh, i have to go letter by letter?
2013-02-03 21:39:07	Racoon	you see you get s string right? then you ord the string when what you sound like you really want to do is ord each letter
2013-02-03 21:39:14	Racoon	right
2013-02-03 21:39:19	Racoon	i assume
2013-02-03 21:39:31	User048	yeah, each letter needs its own ord
2013-02-03 21:39:38	User048	but i thought i could just apply that to the whole string
2013-02-03 21:39:40	User048	okay
2013-02-03 21:40:27	Racoon	if only it were that easy.
2013-02-03 21:40:42	User048	lol
2013-02-03 21:41:13	Racoon	you may be able to do something like (map ord input) and get a list of orders but a move like that may be out of the scope of 161
2013-02-03 21:42:43	Racoon	so approach the for loop as a tool to analyze -> interpret -> and act on each letter in the string
2013-02-03 21:43:36	Racoon	thus: 'for letter in input' <- is about how the for loop should start
2013-02-03 21:43:49	Racoon	yeah?
2013-02-03 21:43:54	User048	okay yeah
2013-02-03 21:43:58	User048	i'll try that thanks
2013-02-03 21:45:56	Racoon	sure. I'll be here all night
2013-02-03 21:46:20	User048	ugh the cafe i'm working in is now closing
2013-02-03 21:49:22	Racoon	:(
2013-02-03 21:50:48	User048	syntax error
2013-02-03 21:51:00	User048	it doesn't like "For letter in input:"
2013-02-03 21:51:12	User048	the word letter is apparently not okay
2013-02-03 21:51:15	User048	"letter"
2013-02-03 21:52:23	Racoon	also, from your code you save the input into a variable called 'i'
2013-02-03 21:52:45	Racoon	is that still the case? (for letter in i)
2013-02-03 21:53:00	User048	yeah

2013-02-03 21:55:09	Racoon	for a in b: says that a will describe each element of b in the for loop
2013-02-03 21:55:32	Racoon	if input is save in i you should: for letter in i
2013-02-03 21:55:51	User048	yeah i did that
2013-02-03 21:55:52	User048	hm
2013-02-03 21:56:08	User048	I have
2013-02-03 21:56:11	User048	For letter in i:
2013-02-03 21:56:25	User048	          number = ord(letter)

2013-02-03 21:56:48	User048	and python has an issue with my use of the word "letter"
2013-02-03 21:58:10	Racoon	what happens if you give it an alternat label say c
2013-02-03 22:00:31	hapa	anyone there?
2013-02-03 22:01:01	Racoon	yiup
2013-02-03 22:01:02	hapa	i have a question about calling the destructor of a class..
2013-02-03 22:01:35	hapa	i thought that the syntax was similar to the way you would call a class member function
2013-02-03 22:01:57	<--	User048 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has quit (Quit: CGI:IRC (Ping timeout))
2013-02-03 22:02:04	hapa	so like classType.memFunction();
2013-02-03 22:02:21	hapa	so i thought to call the destructor it would be...
2013-02-03 22:02:39	hapa	classType.~classType();
2013-02-03 22:03:09	Racoon	User048, you need to use for as opposed to F... awe he/she left
2013-02-03 22:03:10	hapa	but when i compile i get the error: expected primary-expression before '.' token
2013-02-03 22:03:15	Racoon	mkay
2013-02-03 22:03:38	hapa	hopefully they will come back
2013-02-03 22:03:56	Racoon	till then lets focus on you thought
2013-02-03 22:05:04	hapa	what's the proper way to call a destructor
2013-02-03 22:05:20	hapa	or...can you even call the manually call the destructor?
2013-02-03 22:05:32	Racoon	OH!
2013-02-03 22:05:59	Racoon	yeah! i think the destructer gets called once you use the 'delete' function.
2013-02-03 22:06:29	hapa	oh so you cant just call the destructor on your own
2013-02-03 22:06:49	Racoon	:\ im pretty sure
2013-02-03 22:06:50	hapa	idk if im being clear about what i mean
2013-02-03 22:07:08	Racoon	I'll look on the webs, but i have to change my load of clothes real quick
2013-02-03 22:07:14	pfaffle	yes
2013-02-03 22:07:14	@krinkle	the destructor is kind of like the constructor. you don't call it directly by it's name, you call it using the new/delete operators when you dynamically allocate the object
2013-02-03 22:07:27	Racoon	^^^
2013-02-03 22:07:31	Racoon	just in time
2013-02-03 22:07:38	@krinkle	(if you don't use 'new' then you don't have to use the destructor)
2013-02-03 22:07:47	@krinkle	not explicitly, anyways
2013-02-03 22:07:55	hapa	oh hmmm..
2013-02-03 22:08:14	hapa	that helps a lot..
2013-02-03 22:11:33	hapa	so..im working with a flexable array, and in the code that i wrote for my destructor i have a local temp pointer to a node. and then in a while loop i use that temp to point around the first node that head is pointing to, and delete an array that was created dynamically using the delete with [] then i delete what head is pointing to, then have head point to temp.
2013-02-03 22:12:05	hapa	(sorry if that was a wall of text just then)
2013-02-03 22:13:17	hapa	so in a class remove function....i feel like the code is the same..?
2013-02-03 22:13:56	@krinkle	a remove all or a remove one?
2013-02-03 22:14:04	hapa	remove all
2013-02-03 22:14:33	@krinkle	yep the destructor will be pretty much the same as a remove all
2013-02-03 22:14:51	@krinkle	except removeall can be called directly, not with delete
2013-02-03 22:15:20	-->	User048 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-02-03 22:15:25	User048	hi i'm back
2013-02-03 22:15:31	User048	is racoon there?
2013-02-03 22:18:40	hapa	hm. so if the destructor can not be explicitly..then in remove all, is it correct that i could just say delete head ..and would call the destructor which would delete the whole flexable array
2013-02-03 22:21:01	@krinkle	hapa: delete head shouldn't delete the whole flexible array, sorry if I misunderstood you before. It should just delete one node.
2013-02-03 22:22:26	hapa	oh okay. i always get so confused about the destructor
2013-02-03 22:23:22	@krinkle	User048: do you have another question we can help with?
2013-02-03 22:25:53	User048	i'm trying to do my homework and i have a glitch
2013-02-03 22:26:31	User048	I want to say "for every letter in the inputted string, assign a unicode number to each letter, and print that number, then determine if this unicode is even or odd"
2013-02-03 22:26:53	User048	and when i write "for letter in i" (i is the input)
2013-02-03 22:27:05	User048	i get the error that python doesn't like "letter"
2013-02-03 22:27:08	User048	i don't get it
2013-02-03 22:27:20	kini	"doesn't like"?
2013-02-03 22:27:24	kini	please give the full error message :)
2013-02-03 22:27:27	User048	i get a syntax error
2013-02-03 22:27:43	kini	does it point at "letter"?
2013-02-03 22:27:52	User048	it highlights "letter" in red
2013-02-03 22:27:56	User048	and says "syntax error"
2013-02-03 22:27:59	kini	hmm
2013-02-03 22:28:14	kini	can you post your full code somewhere so I can take a look? For example, http://gist.github.com/
2013-02-03 22:28:45	User048	https://gist.github.com/
2013-02-03 22:29:04	kini	I think you copied the wrong link
2013-02-03 22:30:01	User048	http://pastebin.com/R7M6q0zu
2013-02-03 22:30:04	User048	this should work
2013-02-03 22:30:43	kini	ok, so I don't see "for letter in i" anywhere in there
2013-02-03 22:30:47	kini	is that an old version of your code?
2013-02-03 22:32:07	Racoon	User048: try using a lowercase 'F' in your 'For'
2013-02-03 22:32:33	User048	http://pastebin.com/Ta11rW5d
2013-02-03 22:32:48	User048	still invalid syntax
2013-02-03 22:32:48	kini	yup, try a lowercase F
2013-02-03 22:32:54	kini	Python is case-sensitive
2013-02-03 22:33:02	kini	so "For" is different from "for" in Python
2013-02-03 22:33:26	kini	while "for" is a language keyword which you can use to make for-loops, "For" is just a generic name that you could use as a variable or for other purposes
2013-02-03 22:33:44	kini	so the syntax error is because Python doesn't realize you're trying to make a for loop, and wonders why you have put two variable names next to each other
2013-02-03 22:33:56	User048	also i is undefined
2013-02-03 22:33:57	Racoon	^^ this
2013-02-03 22:34:12	User048	i changed it to a lower-case f and it still doesn't work
2013-02-03 22:34:24	kini	is it a different error now?
2013-02-03 22:34:33	User048	just a general syntax error
2013-02-03 22:34:35	kini	if so, you have made progress :)
2013-02-03 22:34:41	kini	hmm
2013-02-03 22:34:54	kini	still pointing to that same line?
2013-02-03 22:34:59	kini	oh
2013-02-03 22:35:06	kini	by the way, you have the same problem with your "If" and "Else" later on
2013-02-03 22:35:15	User048	okay, i just got it to work
2013-02-03 22:35:16	User048	yay
2013-02-03 22:35:21	kini	how?
2013-02-03 22:35:32	User048	lower-case else and if and for
2013-02-03 22:35:35	User048	you were right
2013-02-03 22:35:37	kini	hurrah :)
2013-02-03 22:35:55	Racoon	run it and test it out -> does it work exactly right?
2013-02-03 22:36:30	User048	python just crashed
2013-02-03 22:36:33	User048	hang on plz
2013-02-03 22:36:57	User048	but it printed out a number for every letter of the string
2013-02-03 22:36:57	Racoon	*(check the indentation of your if-else statements)*
2013-02-03 22:37:32	Racoon	python uses indentation to understand what statements ar part of any 'block'
2013-02-03 22:37:59	Racoon	according to your last pastebin the If-Else statements are outside of your for loop

2013-02-03 22:46:05	User899	that was probs just cuz i was working on 3 programs at once
2013-02-03 22:46:05	hapa	krinkle: if your still there could you take a look at what i came up with... http://pastebin.com/2cWgJ3eY
2013-02-03 22:46:19	hapa	or whoever else can help..could you look at it
2013-02-03 22:46:24	hapa	please and thanks :)
2013-02-03 22:48:50	Racoon	User899: you should also save some kind of data to number, you try to access it but you have no line in your program that assignes it a value
2013-02-03 22:59:34	User899	okay, my problem is that i don't have a way of checking each unicode to see if it's odd or even
2013-02-03 22:59:42	User899	anything is divisible by 2, but with a remainder
2013-02-03 23:03:58	kini	User899: can you learn anything from what the remainder is?
2013-02-03 23:10:01	User899	if it's zero, then it would be even
2013-02-03 23:10:10	User899	the unicode would be an even number
2013-02-03 23:10:48	User899	is there a compute funciton?
2013-02-03 23:11:20	User899	so compute: unicode %2 -> if remainer==0 --> print(".")
2013-02-03 23:11:38	User899	how would i say that in python?
2013-02-03 23:11:44	User899	i wish there were a dictionary for python
2013-02-03 23:17:49	@krinkle	hapa: your symbolList destructor and your removeAll functions look good to me, except that you'll still need to delete [] the itemInfo in each node
2013-02-03 23:18:27	@krinkle	in removeAll
2013-02-03 23:18:43	@krinkle	you could even call removeAll from your destructor and it would accomplish the same thing
2013-02-03 23:19:25	@krinkle	you're right that delete head; calls the destructor for the node (not the destructor for the symbolList)

2013-02-03 23:38:09	Racoon	User899: you are almost there. use the if statement to check whether a particular letter is even, if it is print '.' else print the letter.
2013-02-03 23:38:33	Racoon	if (letter % 2 == 0) then ... else ...
2013-02-03 23:52:06	User899	okay everything is working but now i have to make it print horizontally not vertically
2013-02-03 23:52:14	User899	so i foundthis on the internet:
2013-02-03 23:52:22	User899	.join(text.split())
2013-02-03 23:52:30	User899	and it doesn't work

2013-02-03 23:52:34	User899	big surprise?
2013-02-03 23:52:37	User899	:)
2013-02-03 23:54:51	Racoon	oh
2013-02-03 23:55:00	Racoon	easy actually i just learned this
2013-02-03 23:55:16	User899	i would love to know if you could please share :)
2013-02-03 23:55:23	Racoon	so by defualt the print() funtion adds a \n to every statement
2013-02-03 23:55:28	User899	oooooo
2013-02-03 23:55:44	Racoon	you can 'overload' this so to speak by giving it an alternative
2013-02-03 23:56:27	Racoon	I'll verify in a sec but you specify something like print(blah, end="")
2013-02-03 23:56:41	User899	so i would just add "+" after every line
2013-02-03 23:57:05	User899	that's not it

2013-02-04 10:40:28	Lawrence	ok, I've not needed help until now.  But I need help... how does this work?
2013-02-04 10:41:31	dondon	just ask your question; there are people here waiting to help
2013-02-04 10:41:48	Lawrence	I know a dondon...
2013-02-04 10:41:50	dondon	if you've got code to show us, use pastebin.org etc
2013-02-04 10:42:18	Lawrence	Is that Superman?
2013-02-04 10:44:56	Lawrence	ok, I am trying to deallocate memory on the pop of a stack...
2013-02-04 10:46:40	Lawrence	It errors on attempting to delete a LLL node
2013-02-04 10:47:41	Lawrence	Do I just copy and past code into this chat at the bottom?
2013-02-04 10:48:32	dondon	use pastebin.org and put the link in here
2013-02-04 10:48:49	Lawrence	http://pastebin.com/bRckKm54#
2013-02-04 10:49:05	Lawrence	I see... done.
2013-02-04 10:51:06	dondon	so you're deleting the first node in the LLL?
2013-02-04 10:51:50	Lawrence	It's a circular linked list
2013-02-04 10:53:10	Racoon	is ptr a global variable?
2013-02-04 10:53:45	Lawrence	No
2013-02-04 10:54:00	Lawrence	Private var for the class
2013-02-04 10:54:28	Lawrence	when I get to line 15... delete ptr;  I get the error.
2013-02-04 10:56:51	Lawrence	Question... when I delete a pointer to a node, do I need to delete dynam arrays inside the node as well?
2013-02-04 10:57:21	Lawrence	sword.delete_weapon() simply deletes a char * name; in a sub_class
2013-02-04 10:57:56	Racoon	I believe so yes, have you made a destructor?
2013-02-04 10:58:49	Lawrence	Yes, but it calls this function
2013-02-04 11:00:17	Lawrence	does deleting a pointer to a node also delete any dynam arrays in the ptr node?
2013-02-04 11:00:40	Lawrence	If so, maybe I am trying to delete that dynam array twice
2013-02-04 11:03:42	Racoon	try looking into that.. I'll need a little more context before i can make any confident assumptions
2013-02-04 11:24:25	+alevar	temp is never assigned to after the first assignment.
2013-02-04 11:24:30	+alevar	Lawrence: ^
2013-02-04 11:25:08	Lawrence	just saw your message, let me look
2013-02-04 11:25:28	+alevar	while(temp) { } needs to have a line that is effectively temp = temp->next;
2013-02-04 11:31:03	Lawrence	OMG I swapped ptr and temp in my code lines 15 & 16
2013-02-04 11:31:37	+alevar	That'll do it.
2013-02-04 11:32:49	+alevar	hmmm
2013-02-04 11:33:22	+alevar	Make absolutely sure your algorithm is correct there.
2013-02-04 11:33:47	Lawrence	re-writing some things
2013-02-04 11:33:54	+alevar	yup
2013-02-04 11:35:12	Lawrence	Here's my code... http://pastebin.com/2PasEYXH
2013-02-04 11:35:50	Lawrence	is that second func to delete the dynam array necessary or redundant?
2013-02-04 11:39:38	Lawrence	http://pastebin.com/htZ3tCni ... revised
2013-02-04 11:40:11	+alevar	delete_weapon() should be a destructor.
2013-02-04 11:40:45	+alevar	~weapon::delete_weapon() { delete[] label; }
2013-02-04 11:43:13	+alevar	Is node something like: struct node { node *next; weapon sword; }; ?
2013-02-04 11:43:30	zaalatta	alevar: destructors don't take arguments...
2013-02-04 11:43:53	zaalatta	You can use the destructor as a kind of wrapper function for the delete_weapon function
2013-02-04 11:44:01	Lawrence	delete_weapon is a destructor essentially
2013-02-04 11:44:06	+alevar	yeah
2013-02-04 11:44:21	Lawrence	the actual destructor calls this func
2013-02-04 11:44:58	Lawrence	yes that is my node
2013-02-04 11:46:10	+alevar	Ah, because you have to have a weapon struct in main() {} or wherever you're implementing prompting.
2013-02-04 11:47:36	Lawrence	the weapon struct is a private member of one_guy
2013-02-04 11:49:01	+alevar	I think you'll get a double free if the destructor calls delete_weapon()
2013-02-04 11:49:26	+alevar	Once in delete_guy() and once when the node is deallocated.
2013-02-04 11:51:34	+alevar	delete_guy() explicitly calls delete_weapon(), then the node's destructor implicitly calls weapon::~weapon, which in turn calls delete_weapon()
2013-02-04 11:53:10	Lawrence	so I am doubly deallocating
2013-02-04 11:53:13	Lawrence	?
2013-02-04 11:53:22	+alevar	Yeah
2013-02-04 11:53:25	Lawrence	hmm
2013-02-04 11:53:50	+alevar	I assume. It's a little hard to tell from just one piece of code.
2013-02-04 11:54:06	Lawrence	YOu may have me in the right direction... thats what matters
2013-02-04 12:01:25	Lawrence	That little change may have straightened out some other parts....

2013-02-06 10:31:33	snarfel	By chance, anyone use the Git client for Windows? I'm working on a personal project and trying to commit to an org's private repo I'm an owner of, but I get a 'commit failed, please open the options menu from the dashboard and update your name and email settings'
2013-02-06 10:32:39	snarfel	I'm kind of tempted to go back to using SVN. Only used the client because I thought the native client would be 'easier' to use.
2013-02-06 10:32:58	snarfel	s/Git/Github
2013-02-06 10:36:39	pfaffle	snarfel: sounds like you need to set your name/email in your git config
2013-02-06 10:37:06	pfaffle	ohwait, you're using the github client?
2013-02-06 10:37:23	snarfel	Yeah, I am
2013-02-06 10:38:19	 *	pfaffle hasn't used that much
2013-02-06 10:38:25	pfaffle	i use tortoisegit
2013-02-06 10:38:42	pfaffle	but the error still sounds like what i said
2013-02-06 10:38:48	pfaffle	just not sure where to get there in the github client
2013-02-06 10:39:15	snarfel	I opened up the config via notepad, not sure what I'm supposed to save into it though...
2013-02-06 10:39:31	retrov	snarfel: do you know if the repo requires an SSH key?
2013-02-06 10:39:47	retrov	does it use ssh:// to access it or is it using https://
2013-02-06 10:39:53	retrov	s/it/the github client
2013-02-06 10:40:44	 *	pfaffle wonders what would make retrov jump to the conclusion that that was the problem
2013-02-06 10:40:56	snarfel	The browser shows it setup as HTTPS
2013-02-06 10:41:03	pfaffle	snarfel: it doesn't haev some way to configure it in the client itself?
2013-02-06 10:41:40	retrov	pfaffle: would a private repo really only need the right name/email address for access? i thought access was usually done via SSH keys
2013-02-06 10:42:37	snarfel	pfaffle: Not to my knowledge: 'Tools' only brings up the option to edit origin, .gitignore, and .gitattributes
2013-02-06 10:42:57	pfaffle	retrov: not *only* but it's still a requirement
2013-02-06 10:43:08	 *	retrov didn't know that
2013-02-06 10:43:10	pfaffle	i feel like the error would be more clear if an ssh key was actually a problem
2013-02-06 10:43:31	pfaffle	i mean, you have to have *a* name and email address set before you can commit
2013-02-06 10:43:33	pfaffle	i'm pretty sure
2013-02-06 10:43:38	pfaffle	not *a correct* one
2013-02-06 10:43:58	snarfel	Yeah, hence why you can publish under something else, even if it's false
2013-02-06 10:49:58	pfaffle	snarfel: let's see if it works the same as tortoisegit
2013-02-06 10:50:12	pfaffle	try making a file in C:\users\$yourusername called .gitconfig
2013-02-06 10:50:23	pfaffle	and put:
2013-02-06 10:50:26	pfaffle	[user]
2013-02-06 10:50:35	pfaffle	   name = yournamehere
2013-02-06 10:50:42	pfaffle	    email = youremailhere
2013-02-06 10:50:50	pfaffle	(oops, those should be indented the same)
2013-02-06 10:55:11	snarfel	Well, I'll be, problem solved.
2013-02-06 10:55:54	snarfel	Although it's listed under 'Unsynced Commits' now and I'm curious as to what that means...
2013-02-06 10:59:13	snarfel	I'm guessing I have to click 'Publish' to actually push it to the server's repo then
2013-02-06 11:01:48	snarfel	Yep yep, officially commited, thanks a bunch. pfaffle++

2013-02-06 14:58:04	bowzr	quick question about copy constructers. The code for the constructer of an object of a class derived from another class goes like this "child::child() : parent()". When i create copy constructers, do i need to use that same syntax? e.g. "child::child(const child&) : parent(const parent&)" or do i simply use "child::child(const child&)"?
2013-02-06 14:59:50	bowzr	in c++ that is
2013-02-06 15:05:38	@krinkle	bowzr: I believe the parent copy constructor will be called implicitly, so you don't need to put it in the initialization list
2013-02-06 15:05:57	bowzr	cool, thanks

2013-02-06 18:21:46	phat-pat	im using crittertest.cpp as the main
2013-02-06 18:24:53	fas	gist is very good
2013-02-06 18:24:58	fas	for multiple files
2013-02-06 18:28:15	phat-pat	the issue is that only the functions from the base class are being called even though i would like the functions defined in the derived class to be called
2013-02-06 18:28:42	phat-pat	the functions have the same name but the ones in the base are declared virteual
2013-02-06 18:29:35	phat-pat	there are two base classes but only focus on the creature class  becuase once i get it i will be able to fix the other one
2013-02-06 18:29:54	phat-pat	i think it is something very simple
2013-02-06 18:32:27	phat-pat	the program can be tested by adding a spider and then retrieve/testing a spider
2013-02-06 18:33:04	phat-pat	o shit i gave you guys the wrong main

2013-02-06 18:36:12	phat-pat	but as i was saying
2013-02-06 18:37:08	phat-pat	the retrive option in main (case 11) tests a few of the functions, and it only calls the ones from the base
2013-02-06 18:40:54	phat-pat	when i would like it to be calling them dynamically
2013-02-06 18:58:40	fas	Calling *what* dynamically?
2013-02-06 18:59:50	fas	Are you saying that instead of calling a function that overwrites the base class function, it's just calling the base class function?
2013-02-06 19:00:36	phat-pat	correct
2013-02-06 19:01:45	fas	I remember having that problem

2013-02-06 19:03:05	fas	Im trying to remember... lol
2013-02-06 19:03:33	phat-pat	haha, i don have to put virtual in the actual implementations right?

2013-02-06 19:23:02	phat-pat	yea, everything ive found seems constistant with my code
2013-02-06 19:25:38	phat-pat	ill stop by tomorrow and see if anyone can figure it out
2013-02-06 19:25:46	phat-pat	fas++ thanks for the help
2013-02-06 19:30:03	bowzr	check karlas slides and make sure you are following the four rules
2013-02-06 19:30:39	bowzr	i used it in mine and they overwrite it, you only need the virtual in the base class
2013-02-06 19:30:55	bowzr	overwrite the function in the base class, that is
2013-02-06 19:31:01	phat-pat	think it could be this line?
2013-02-06 19:31:05	phat-pat	data = new creature(to_add);
2013-02-06 19:31:56	phat-pat	this is in my node constructor, since creature is a base class and to_add is a derived am i losing all my derived traits here?
2013-02-06 19:37:16	bowzr	here are the 4 rules, double check if you have all of these in place
2013-02-06 19:37:38	bowzr	1: there must be an inheritance heirarchy using public derivation
2013-02-06 19:38:20	bowzr	2:There must be a declared public member function to virtual in either a direct or inderect base class
2013-02-06 19:39:31	bowzr	2:An overriden member function implemented in a derived class must have exactly the same signature and return type as the virtual function declaration
2013-02-06 19:40:16	bowzr	4: (i think this one might be your problem) the overridden function must be accessed through a direct or indirect base class pointer or reference
2013-02-06 19:40:42	phat-pat	none of the above :(
2013-02-06 19:41:07	phat-pat	i think it could be something to do with my copy constructor but i really dont know
2013-02-06 19:41:20	phat-pat	thanks though
2013-02-06 19:41:34	bowzr	no, that cant be it, the copy constructer is only for when you are copying classes
2013-02-06 19:42:02	phat-pat	i guess i meant regular constructor
2013-02-06 19:42:17	bowzr	look at the topic 4 slides in karlas course content, slide 27 has some coding examples
2013-02-06 19:42:31	phat-pat	ok, i will check it out
2013-02-06 19:43:10	bowzr	slide 24 has more examples
2013-02-06 19:47:23	phat-pat	testmain3.cpp:4:5: warning: extended initializer lists only available with -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x [enabled by default]
2013-02-06 19:47:32	phat-pat	hmm, what does this mean?
2013-02-06 19:47:53	phat-pat	o wait
2013-02-06 19:48:04	phat-pat	got that part
2013-02-06 19:49:03	phat-pat	ok, so i got it working in a small instance, i think i may be able to hunt this one down
2013-02-06 19:50:14	bowzr	good luck. id look at my code to give you more examples, but i cant into cs account for some reason...
2013-02-06 19:50:24	bowzr	*into my cs
2013-02-06 19:50:29	phat-pat	weird
2013-02-06 19:50:49	phat-pat	i think i was passing a child to the parent's copy constructor
2013-02-06 19:51:07	phat-pat	and so i was losing my child attributes
2013-02-06 19:52:34	bowzr	that shouldnt be happening, parents dont know anything about their children
2013-02-06 19:52:42	bowzr	in C++, that is

2013-02-06 22:45:17	User899	or is it the order computation occurs?
2013-02-06 22:45:48	User899	cuz it could mean both
2013-02-06 22:46:06	drbop	It's the order computation occurs.  It's pretty much the same concept as the order you perform operations with in arithmetic.
2013-02-06 22:46:23	User899	thank you!
2013-02-06 22:46:59	drbop	An identifier is pretty much the name for an object such as a variable or function.
2013-02-06 22:47:45	User899	so in the expression 5X, the idetifier would be 5, and the variable being identified is X?
2013-02-06 22:48:24	drbop	I'm not sure what you mean by the expression 5X.  Do you mean 5 times X?
2013-02-06 22:49:42	User899	yes
2013-02-06 22:50:05	drbop	In that case 5 is a constant.  The identifier here would be X.
2013-02-06 22:50:30	User899	so then what's the diff btwen a variable and an identifier?
2013-02-06 22:52:34	drbop	For the most part nothing much.  You could think of the identifier simply being the name of the variable.  But there can be ways to access variables without using its identifier.  For instance in C you could have a pointer point to a variable and access the variable through dereferencing the pointer.  You would have then just accessed the variable without using its identifier.
2013-02-06 22:56:42	User899	so then i have this test question - 'which of the following is a valid identifier?'
2013-02-06 22:57:08	User899	$323
2013-02-06 22:57:09	User899	mile
2013-02-06 22:57:11	User899	9X
2013-02-06 22:57:14	User899	or print
2013-02-06 22:57:41	drbop	The answer to that question would largely depend on the language being discussed.
2013-02-06 22:57:46	User899	python
2013-02-06 22:57:49	User899	i'm in CS161
2013-02-06 22:57:55	User899	i think the answer is 9X
2013-02-06 22:58:19	drbop	Okay.  Each programming language has their own requirements for identifiers.
2013-02-06 22:59:30	drbop	Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with Python to know what requirements it has with valid identifier names.
2013-02-06 23:01:49	drbop	Just try and think of which one could you use for a variable name.
2013-02-06 23:02:17	User899	okay i think it's 9x
2013-02-06 23:02:27	Wren	User899: no
2013-02-06 23:02:31	User899	but it could also be mile
2013-02-06 23:02:35	Wren	yes
2013-02-06 23:02:39	User899	not print cuz it's a statement
2013-02-06 23:02:44	Wren	Think of which ones you could use as a variable name
2013-02-06 23:03:02	Wren	Most programming languages do not allow variables to start with a number
2013-02-06 23:03:05	User899	and not $343 cuz it could be confused for a value
2013-02-06 23:03:13	User899	so it has to be "mile"
2013-02-06 23:03:23	User899	but X could be a valid identifier, right?
2013-02-06 23:03:26	Wren	yes
2013-02-06 23:03:30	Wren	I'm pretty sure $varname is just illegal syntax in python altogether
2013-02-06 23:03:40	User899	??
2013-02-06 23:03:45	Wren	Perl, PHP, and some other languages use it to indicate variables
2013-02-06 23:03:51	User899	??
2013-02-06 23:03:56	User899	$varname?
2013-02-06 23:03:59	User899	what is that?
2013-02-06 23:04:07	Wren	A placeholder name I just made up
2013-02-06 23:04:16	User899	ooooo
2013-02-06 23:04:18	User899	hm
2013-02-06 23:04:24	Wren	One of the answers you provided was $323
2013-02-06 23:04:32	User899	so a valid identifier must not have any special characters?
2013-02-06 23:04:37	Wren	Pretty much.
2013-02-06 23:04:47	Wren	Underscore's are allowed
2013-02-06 23:04:53	Wren	Not sure what specifically python permits
2013-02-06 23:05:37	drbop	I just looked it up.  Python allows lower and uppercase letters, the underscore, and numbers that are not the first character in the identifier.
2013-02-06 23:07:36	User899	is it true that tuples are usually heterogenous collections?
2013-02-06 23:07:54	User899	and what does it mean that tuples are "hashable"??
2013-02-06 23:12:10	User899	hello?
2013-02-06 23:12:37	Wren	Stick around. Somebody will come along if they know the answer.
2013-02-06 23:12:43	drbop	Sorry, I'm not that familiar with python and was doing a little web searching.
2013-02-06 23:12:56	Wren	If you have to go to bed just leave your browser window open
2013-02-06 23:12:57	User899	cool, thanks so much
2013-02-06 23:13:24	drbop	If by "heterogenous collection" you mean it can have different data types as parts of the collection, then yeah, that's what tuples are for.
2013-02-06 23:15:21	drbop	Hashable means that the hash value never changes, that is the value returned by the __hash__() function.
2013-02-06 23:15:38	drbop	This means you can use tuples as a dictionary key or a set member.
2013-02-06 23:32:58	User899	okay i have a question
2013-02-06 23:33:04	User899	how do i truncate a float?
2013-02-06 23:38:56	User899	?
2013-02-06 23:51:03	User899	hello?
2013-02-06 23:52:33	Wren	It's almost midnight, be patient.
2013-02-07 00:00:07	pfaffle	User899: that usually has to do with formatting your output
2013-02-07 00:00:28	pfaffle	i'm not sure what functions you'd typically use in python for that
2013-02-07 00:01:02	pfaffle	http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html

2013-02-07 00:05:59	User899	sooooo
2013-02-07 00:06:04	User899	say i'm trying to print this statement
2013-02-07 00:06:08	User899	print(bill,": ", tip1, "/", tip2)
2013-02-07 00:06:21	User899	and i want to truncate it to the hundreths place
2013-02-07 00:07:10	User899	would i write def trunc ((print (bill,": ", tip1, "/", tip2)), 2)
2013-02-07 00:07:29	User899	or would i put the def trunc (f,n) somewhere else to make it work properaly?

2013-02-07 00:49:34	User899	hi i have one last question
2013-02-07 00:49:41	User899	on my mac using python IDLE
2013-02-07 00:49:56	User899	when i type bill = bill+1
2013-02-07 00:50:07	User899	it yeilds the same result as when i type
2013-02-07 00:50:21	User899	bill = bill + 1
2013-02-07 00:50:25	User899	is that normal?
2013-02-07 00:50:32	User899	idon't think so
2013-02-07 00:50:45	Wren	That looks right. Languages generally ignore whitespace
2013-02-07 00:50:45	User899	one of them is supposed to be wrong
2013-02-07 00:50:56	User899	hm
2013-02-07 00:51:03	Wren	Are you sure you typed it correctly?
2013-02-07 00:51:16	Wren	'=' vs '==', for instance?
2013-02-07 00:52:57	User899	hmmmm
2013-02-07 00:58:44	User899	okay so say i want my program to work for 5 amounts
2013-02-07 00:58:53	User899	the starting number would be 0, and the ending would be 4?
2013-02-07 00:59:48	User899	and in a while loop, does the count = count + 1 statement always have to go at the very end of the loop?
2013-02-07 00:59:57	User899	i guess it does, now that i think about it
2013-02-07 00:59:59	User899	okay
2013-02-07 01:57:23	fas	When you "think about it" a lot of stuff starts to make sense.

2013-02-07 12:52:05	MaddHatter	doesn't python have for loops?
2013-02-07 12:52:11	Wren	yeah
2013-02-07 12:52:39	MaddHatter	seems an odd choice to use while, then.
2013-02-07 12:53:58	Wren	Maybe the assignment required it.
2013-02-07 12:54:59	Wren	Also, python doesn't have traditional for loops, where you have a variable and increment/decrement it. It has for loop where you itereate through every single element in a collection
2013-02-07 12:55:24	Wren	If you want to loop from 1 to 10, you do `for varname in range(1,10):`
2013-02-07 12:59:41	lewisrjc	it basically only has foreach loops which is...interesting
2013-02-07 13:21:50	MaddHatter	it's sometimes argued that Perl has no need of -- and should drop -- the traditional C-style for loop, relying only on foreach instead.
2013-02-07 13:24:50	MaddHatter	for the most-common case of foreach my $loopvar (1..10), it is redundant, but having to refactor for ($loopvar=start(); $loopvar!=end(); $loopvar=increment()) into a while loop befogs some use cases, I think
2013-02-07 21:49:00	-->	bhunt2 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-02-07 21:50:54	bhunt2	good even everyone. does anyone here know about the CS201 homework assignment where you have to defuse a bomb.  I can't get the thing to compile because it keeps saying it is missing a support.h header file
2013-02-07 21:52:22	jesusaurus	are you including the header file?
2013-02-07 21:53:10	bhunt2	we get the bomb in a tar file and we are just suppose to extract the tar file through one of the unix boxes and everything is suppose to be there
2013-02-07 21:53:56	bhunt2	then it is like a big puzzle to decode the assembly and such to figure out what needs to be entered at the prompts inorder to "difuse" the bomb
2013-02-07 21:55:37	jesusaurus	is that a yes or a no about the include?
2013-02-07 21:55:48	bhunt2	It says it can only be done on the linux systems at the school but I was thinking that it would still work if I doing it if I was SSH'ing in
2013-02-07 21:55:56	jesusaurus	have you worked with c/c++ before?
2013-02-07 21:56:18	bhunt2	the bomb.c file includes the header file
2013-02-07 21:56:37	jesusaurus	okay, and the header file exists in the directory?
2013-02-07 21:57:52	bhunt2	that is the thing we don't get to see all the program does or all the files it is connected to.  all we can see is the bomb.c (just has a basic main function in it to call necessary functions) and a README file that tells us a little about what to do
2013-02-07 21:58:33	jesusaurus	are you supposed to write support.h?
2013-02-07 21:58:51	jesusaurus	i have zero knowledge of the assignment, i just know compiler errors
2013-02-07 21:59:01	bhunt2	nope everything is suppose to be there
2013-02-07 21:59:28	jesusaurus	im confused, you do or dont have all of the source code?
2013-02-07 22:00:15	bhunt2	all the source code is there but hidden, we have to compile and decode the assembly to learn what it does so that we can enter the correct things at the prompts when we run the program
2013-02-07 22:00:36	bhunt2	when I go to compile it doesn't find the support header
2013-02-07 22:00:49	jesusaurus	so you have a compiled executable?
2013-02-07 22:01:14	bhunt2	nope, it won't compile because it says there isn't a support.h file
2013-02-07 22:01:34	jesusaurus	is that because there was no support.h in the tarball?
2013-02-07 22:01:37	bhunt2	that is why I was hoping someone here might know something about it
2013-02-07 22:02:05	bhunt2	I am not sure because everything is hidden
2013-02-07 22:02:19	bhunt2	I can send you the tar file if you would like to try it
2013-02-07 22:02:47	jesusaurus	if you need to decode some assembly, it sounds like you dont have all of the source, so you wont be able to compile
2013-02-07 22:02:59	jesusaurus	perhaps you only need to link, and not compile
2013-02-07 22:03:38	bhunt2	maybe you would be able to tell if you saw it
2013-02-07 22:04:00	jesusaurus	how many files are in the tar?
2013-02-07 22:04:19	bhunt2	if you go here http://rita.cat.pdx.edu:15213 you can download your own "bomb"
2013-02-07 22:05:07	bhunt2	there are three, one is a jumbled up file that doesn't resemble any real code.  it does have some info it but totally not able to read any of it
2013-02-07 22:06:51	jesusaurus	what are the extensions on the files?
2013-02-07 22:07:47	bhunt2	bomb.c bomb(no ext) README(no ext)
2013-02-07 22:08:11	bhunt2	bomb.c has the main function that calls other functions but doesn't have them in the file
2013-02-07 22:08:22	bhunt2	bomb(no ext) has a bunch of nonsense
2013-02-07 22:08:35	bhunt2	README(no ext) has a little info about the assignment
2013-02-07 22:10:47	jesusaurus	so bomb.c is some of the source code, and bomb is the compiled executable
2013-02-07 22:11:15	bhunt2	possibly
2013-02-07 22:11:17	jesusaurus	because you don't have support.h you cant compile it, but you dont need to, its already compiled into 'bomb'
2013-02-07 22:11:34	jesusaurus	the command 'file' will tell you
2013-02-07 22:11:58	jesusaurus	so 'file bomb' will likely say something about an ELF executable
2013-02-07 22:12:13	bhunt2	yep you are right
2013-02-07 22:12:50	jesusaurus	so, im guessing the assignment is to figure out what was in support.h without having access to the source
2013-02-07 22:13:07	jesusaurus	or enough of it to be able to give correct input
2013-02-07 22:13:25	bhunt2	how do you disassemble to executable then
2013-02-07 22:14:18	bhunt2	the executable, sorry
2013-02-07 22:14:32	jesusaurus	i dont know off the top of my head
2013-02-07 22:17:16	bhunt2	well that at least gives me something to look into
2013-02-07 22:19:19	bhunt2	tks
2013-02-07 22:20:32	jesusaurus	youre welcome
2013-02-07 23:04:41	bhunt2	fyi, the command is objdump -<whatever option you want> <filename>

2013-02-09 17:40:00	hapa	hi can anyone clearify for me real quick...im working wiht a LLL and i was thinking to not use any structs and have just a class. SO then if the class name was classType then  in the private section i could have classType * next;
2013-02-09 17:40:40	hapa	and that would be the same concept as putting node * next; in a struct, yeah?
2013-02-09 17:42:01	hapa	as in by putting classType * next; i would then have the ability to point to another instance of that class
2013-02-09 18:02:03	pfaffle	hapa: not quite the same thing
2013-02-09 18:02:20	pfaffle	things in the private aren't accessible fromthe outside of the class
2013-02-09 18:02:26	pfaffle	private section*
2013-02-09 18:02:46	pfaffle	in a struct by default everything is public so you can manipulate it at will
2013-02-09 18:04:40	hapa	ohh..so then if i wanted my class to act in the same way a struct does when used to implement nodes of a LLL
2013-02-09 18:04:54	hapa	then i should have the classType * next in the public
2013-02-09 18:05:18	pfaffle	if you put that in the public section then yeah, it will be exactly the same as if it were public
2013-02-09 18:05:23	hapa	and in the private will be the data members..so like a char * name would live there
2013-02-09 18:05:24	pfaffle	err, a struct
2013-02-09 18:06:04	pfaffle	the only difference between classes and structs in C++ is that by default members of a struct are public, and members of a class are private.
2013-02-09 18:06:26	pfaffle	well, what is the goal of your assignment exactly?
2013-02-09 18:07:15	pfaffle	i remember an assignment where karla forced us to implement a LLL while keeping the next pointer and data private
2013-02-09 18:07:40	hapa	karla is always saying that but i guess i never really paid attention to what that was really meaning till now
2013-02-09 18:07:56	hapa	oh so the assignment is to have a stack that keeps character information
2013-02-09 18:08:17	hapa	and a queue that keeps weapon information
2013-02-09 18:08:33	hapa	and with in the stack there needs to be an instance of the weapons queue
2013-02-09 18:08:55	hapa	she has not made it a requirement that we work with only classes yet
2013-02-09 18:08:59	pfaffle	ok
2013-02-09 18:09:17	hapa	but i think she will in 202 or something liek that
2013-02-09 18:09:33	pfaffle	yah sounds right
2013-02-09 18:09:35	hapa	so i thought maybe for this assignemnt i would try it out.
2013-02-09 18:09:38	pfaffle	it makes things ... quite a bit different hehe
2013-02-09 18:10:01	pfaffle	if you wanna try it you have to approach designing the class a little differently
2013-02-09 18:10:04	hapa	oh really like a lot different?
2013-02-09 18:10:17	hapa	hmm..
2013-02-09 18:10:26	pfaffle	so you'll need a class to manage the data structure
2013-02-09 18:10:48	pfaffle	basically something that you can call an 'insert' function, give it some piece of data
2013-02-09 18:10:59	pfaffle	and then *it* does the work of creating the node and sticking the data in it
2013-02-09 18:11:10	pfaffle	you can't manipulate it directly
2013-02-09 18:11:27	pfaffle	likewise with 'delete's
2013-02-09 18:12:46	hapa	ohh..hmm..
2013-02-09 18:13:08	pfaffle	does that make any sense?
2013-02-09 18:13:26	hapa	kind of
2013-02-09 18:13:32	pfaffle	by 'not manipulating it directly' i mean that you kinda have to have a separation between what your data structure's doing and what your main program is
2013-02-09 18:14:10	hapa	but suddenly i think i should stick to the approach i know how to do. -only because im playing catch up in the class still-
2013-02-09 18:14:54	pfaffle	hehe, yes it might be best to not take on too much too quickly
2013-02-09 18:14:56	hapa	so that last thing you just said. that part i get.
2013-02-09 18:15:49	hapa	but so i was thinking that i would have one class that would have the methods that deal with the data in the public section. also in the public section would be that next pointer.
2013-02-09 18:16:02	hapa	and then in the private secion of that same class would be the data members
2013-02-09 18:17:19	hapa	so the methods that are in the public section are not the ones actually manipulating the LLL
2013-02-09 18:17:56	pfaffle	hmm
2013-02-09 18:18:00	hapa	there would need to be an additional class to do that?--am i understanding correctly?
2013-02-09 18:18:33	pfaffle	well, with that design i could see just one class
2013-02-09 18:19:07	pfaffle	but if practicing object oriented program is the goal it doesn't really get you there
2013-02-09 18:19:29	pfaffle	karla always stresses that a class should have more than just 'set' and 'get' functions for data
2013-02-09 18:19:39	pfaffle	otherwise all you'r ereally doing is creating more work for yourself
2013-02-09 18:20:16	hapa	so my ideal situation was that that same class would push, pop, display, and peek.
2013-02-09 18:20:32	pfaffle	right
2013-02-09 18:20:40	pfaffle	and the pointers and data would all be private
2013-02-09 18:21:11	pfaffle	then all your main program would do is call those four functions and the class would do all the dirty work
2013-02-09 18:21:36	hapa	which for an ADT is what i want, yeah?
2013-02-09 18:21:54	hapa	(the next pointer would still be public though yeah?)
2013-02-09 18:22:09	pfaffle	nope it'd be private too
2013-02-09 18:22:23	hapa	oh
2013-02-09 18:22:27	hapa	lol hm.
2013-02-09 18:22:30	pfaffle	you'd call 'push' and the class would set the next pointer and insert the data there
2013-02-09 18:22:50	pfaffle	no need for it to be public in that case
2013-02-09 18:23:04	pfaffle	you want your classes like that to be insulated against outside influences
2013-02-09 18:23:13	pfaffle	a client program shouldn't be able to break the data structure
2013-02-09 18:24:04	pfaffle	and when you pop, it woiuld return the data to you, destroy the next thing in the list and set the pointer to null, etc.
2013-02-09 18:24:18	pfaffle	you never touch the next pointers directly from the client program
2013-02-09 18:24:50	hapa	okay so - if the design was to have one class with methods that manipulated the data stucture as well as containing the data members, the next pointer would live in the private section.
2013-02-09 18:25:07	pfaffle	yeah
2013-02-09 18:25:26	hapa	but if the design was to have a class that contained the data members, the next pointer would be public. and an additional class would be needed to manipulate the data structure
2013-02-09 18:25:49	pfaffle	yep that could work too
2013-02-09 18:26:28	hapa	okay. can i ask one more question?
2013-02-09 18:26:34	pfaffle	sure
2013-02-09 18:27:15	hapa	so im going with the one class design. where does the head pointer live.
2013-02-09 18:27:34	hapa	it living in the client program seems wrong. so i was thinking it should live in the private section
2013-02-09 18:30:02	hapa	in my previous assignment i used a struct to represent the informational data we were storing..like names, comments, blahblah. and then in the class that had the methods to manipulate the data structure the only private member i needed was the head pointer.
2013-02-09 18:30:34	hapa	i think im over thinking it..i feel like this time around it would still be a private data member
2013-02-09 18:32:31	pfaffle	mmh
2013-02-09 18:32:41	pfaffle	sorry, my brain is fuzzy today
2013-02-09 18:33:07	pfaffle	yah, your head pointer should be in the private section in the class in that case
2013-02-09 18:35:34	hapa	hehe it cool.
2013-02-09 18:36:02	 *	pfaffle is not sure if he is giving good advice
2013-02-09 18:36:57	pfaffle	i'm not sure if it's better to have one class do all those things or to have a separate node class/struct to be the individual data members.

2013-02-11 13:04:42	locl	can anyone help me? what is the worst case of run time efficiency in ADT and data structure
2013-02-11 13:05:56	locl	ADT is absolute order list, relative order list, stack, and queue
2013-02-11 13:06:57	locl	data structure is linear linked list, circular linked list, doubly linked list, and array
2013-02-11 13:09:09	@krinkle	locl: are you asking about the worst-case efficiency of searching these structures is?
2013-02-11 13:09:53	@krinkle	or adding, removing, or something else?
2013-02-11 13:12:27	locl	krinkle: I'm not sure, cause Karla does not mention accuracy
2013-02-11 13:13:23	locl	she ask the worst run time efficiency this term in ADT and data structure
2013-02-11 13:19:13	@krinkle	your worst-case efficiency is going to be different depending on what you are doing with your data structure. If you are searching for a particular element in an unordered linear linked list, the worst case will be that the element is not there and the algorithm will to N comparisons (where N is the size of the list). But if you are adding an element to the beginning of the linked list, the worst case will
2013-02-11 13:19:15	@krinkle	be the same as the best case, and won't be related to the size of the list.
2013-02-11 13:20:58	@krinkle	locl: could you copy and paste her instructions here? (assuming it's not more than a few sentences)
2013-02-11 13:22:44	locl	a) When have we seen the worst RUN TIME efficiency this  term… ADT:     Data Structure:
2013-02-11 13:25:06	locl	We have talked a lot this term about efficiency as we have  discussed different data structures and Abstract Data  Types…keep this in mind as you answer the following  questions ADT choices:  Absolute Ordered Lists, Relative  Ordered Lists, Stacks, QueuesData Structure Choices: Linear Linked List, Circular  Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Array a) When have we seen the worst RUN TIME efficiency this  term… ADT: Data Structure:
2013-02-11 13:25:21	locl	this is original question
2013-02-11 13:32:57	@krinkle	hmmm
2013-02-11 13:33:28	@krinkle	so you still have different possible operations that can be done on these adts/data structures
2013-02-11 13:35:11	@krinkle	so you will want to consider what kinds of operations (insert, search, remove, etc) can be done on each adt or data structure, how efficient it is
2013-02-11 13:35:45	@krinkle	karla's slides are a helpful reference for what kinds of operations you can do and a discussion of efficiency: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/cs163_winter2013_002.htm
2013-02-11 13:36:37	@krinkle	keeping in mind the difference between run-time efficiency and memory efficiency

2013-02-12 18:53:12	bowzr	say i have a function that takes in pointers to class objects as arguements. (func(obj *&);). I want to pass in NULL as that arguement, how would i do so?
2013-02-12 19:01:57	@krinkle	func(NULL) ?
2013-02-12 21:39:33	bowzr	yea i tried that before it says no matching functions, candidates are (obj*&)
2013-02-12 21:46:56	-->	tfr (~Adium@71-222-110-136.ptld.qwest.net) has joined #cshelp
2013-02-12 21:49:49	dondon	c++? so func((obj*)NULL) (c-style cast)?
2013-02-12 21:55:21	bowzr	apperantly it just thinks im trying to call a nonexistent object
2013-02-12 21:56:23	dondon	so what is it supposed to do with a NULL?
2013-02-12 22:00:21	@krinkle	bowzr: what is the error you get?
2013-02-12 22:00:46	@krinkle	does it change if you pass the pointer directly (obj *) instead of by reference (obj *&)?
2013-02-12 22:02:01	bowzr	the actual function has 4 different node types in the arguement, but only two will be used at the same time. im trying to pass in NULL by default to the ones that will not be used at the particular instance
2013-02-12 22:03:07	@krinkle	hmm, it works for me if I make an obj pointer with a value of null and pass that in
2013-02-12 22:03:14	@krinkle	rather than passing NULL in directly
2013-02-12 22:04:27	bowzr	i found thta too, but i was hoping for a method that wouldnt require me to make dummy objects everytime this is used
2013-02-12 22:04:49	bowzr	and changing the *& to * didnt do anything
2013-02-12 22:07:00	@krinkle	funny, changing the *& makes it work for me
2013-02-12 22:07:16	@krinkle	I don't know the technical reason why, but it seems like making the dummy null object is the way to go
2013-02-12 22:09:17	bowzr	ok new question, i just realized my current design has a flaw. How can a make a Linearly linked list with objects of different classes but are all derived from one base class?
2013-02-12 22:11:55	bowzr	or is that a topic better explained in person if i came to the cs lounge tomorrow?
2013-02-12 22:14:07	pfaffle	did what dondon suggested not work?
2013-02-12 22:14:14	dondon	you linearly link the base/parent class?
2013-02-12 22:14:14	pfaffle	casting the null as a null of type obj?
2013-02-12 22:15:41	bowzr	no, maybe i typed it in wrong but it thought i was trying to call some nonexistent function
2013-02-12 22:17:09	bowzr	dondon:the base class will not be a node itself, the three classes derived from it will be
2013-02-12 22:17:35	dondon	yes, but all nodes havve to be declared the same type, right?
2013-02-12 22:18:38	dondon	maybe try C++ type-y implicit_cast(). is it (type, thing) or (thing, type)?
2013-02-12 22:20:00	bowzr	i dont follow
2013-02-12 22:20:21	dondon	sorry: #1 is about nodes, #2 is about func(NULL)
2013-02-12 22:20:48	dondon	#2: func( implicit_cast( obj*&, NULL) )
2013-02-12 22:21:10	dondon	it's always best to never cast but...
2013-02-12 22:21:29	dondon	actually, you can make anonymous objects, right?
2013-02-12 22:21:59	dondon	func(new myObj(NULL))?
2013-02-12 22:23:58	 *	dondon has been in C and Java lately, so i'm not much help
2013-02-12 22:25:32	bowzr	yea i cant get that to work, but it turns out that the function is useless because of the way i tried to setup my LLL. so now im trying to figure out how im supposed to make an LLL the has obj's from 3 different classes, all of which are derived from a single base (they each have a dynamically bound functions that do different things inside)
2013-02-12 22:26:02	bowzr	im making a quick test program right now, ill see what i can come up with
2013-02-12 22:27:53	dondon	when I did something similar, the LLL was in the parent (empty-ish) class, and when navigating, it checked the type of the node object with some built-in (this.type?) so it knew what special functions to call

2013-02-19 21:45:04	User391	cuz i have lots of questions
2013-02-19 21:45:33	lewisrjc	yeah, there will be people
2013-02-19 21:45:53	jesusaurus	they may or may not know python though
2013-02-19 21:46:17	lewisrjc	they will, all the tutors are familiar with 161 (which is I believe what class this is?)
2013-02-19 21:46:37	jesusaurus	oh, is 161 python now?
2013-02-19 21:46:49	User391	yeah it is python in 161
2013-02-19 21:47:12	lewisrjc	oh wow
2013-02-19 21:47:15	lewisrjc	nevermind
2013-02-19 21:47:24	User391	lol
2013-02-19 21:47:24	lewisrjc	there is no way to do line numbers in IDLE, how bizarre
2013-02-19 21:47:38	lewisrjc	so, may I reccomend notepad++
2013-02-19 21:47:39	lewisrjc	?
2013-02-19 21:47:51	lewisrjc	http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
2013-02-19 21:47:59	lewisrjc	because you are going to want line numbers
2013-02-19 21:48:05	lewisrjc	but anyways
2013-02-19 21:49:03	lewisrjc	so first off, I want to insure I am not being too disparaging, because I am basically going to list off what's wrong with this code in broad strokes
2013-02-19 21:49:11	lewisrjc	and what's right about it is that it is mostly correct
2013-02-19 21:49:55	User391	excellent please do
2013-02-19 21:49:57	lewisrjc	secondly, for future reference when dealin with a mostly whole program please email the tutor list or pm one of them
2013-02-19 21:50:08	User391	okay, what is your email?
2013-02-19 21:50:10	lewisrjc	there are potential issues of plagarism
2013-02-19 21:50:20	User391	?
2013-02-19 21:50:26	User391	how?
2013-02-19 21:50:35	lewisrjc	tutors@cs.pdx.edu is the email that you would email
2013-02-19 21:50:49	User391	oooo like you could be plaugerized by me?
2013-02-19 21:50:58	lewisrjc	if you post your code in a pastie anyone in this channel can read that pastie, not just me
2013-02-19 21:51:05	User391	ooooo
2013-02-19 21:51:13	lewisrjc	and some of them may or may not be your peers
2013-02-19 21:51:22	User391	well, funny that the tutor chat intro leads up to that pastie portal!!
2013-02-19 21:51:29	lewisrjc	it's actually on them to not cheat, but we try to keep it down to a minimum
2013-02-19 21:51:38	lewisrjc	if you type /topic you will see the full thing
2013-02-19 21:51:46	User391	okay
2013-02-19 21:51:48	lewisrjc	it's more complex when your program is a snippet
2013-02-19 21:51:58	User391	cool cool
2013-02-19 21:52:10	User391	okay so what's wrong with my code in broad strokes?
2013-02-19 21:52:24	lewisrjc	just a FYI/future reference thing (and because krinkle would digitally stab me if didn't mention it)
2013-02-19 21:52:27	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 21:52:35	lewisrjc	well let's start off with the scope issues
2013-02-19 21:52:42	User391	what is scope?
2013-02-19 21:52:51	lewisrjc	actaully
2013-02-19 21:52:51	lewisrjc	no
2013-02-19 21:52:59	lewisrjc	let's start from the top
2013-02-19 21:53:11	lewisrjc	the syntax to import random is import random
2013-02-19 21:53:23	lewisrjc	and that should be the first thing you do, before any variable declarations
2013-02-19 21:53:45	lewisrjc	again, case sensitive, so import random, not Import random
2013-02-19 21:54:25	lewisrjc	programming languages are the ultimate grammar nazi's, if you aren't perfectly correct they won't do anything, and even if you are perfectly correct, they may not do what you want
2013-02-19 21:55:18	lewisrjc	so so are you allowed to use while loops in this program?
2013-02-19 21:55:29	User391	i don't see why not
2013-02-19 21:55:38	User391	but they just want us to use the randrange function
2013-02-19 21:56:10	User391	they said that while loops are not as good as For loops
2013-02-19 21:56:17	User391	so i'm using a for loop
2013-02-19 21:56:22	lewisrjc	because for loops are actually "foreach loops" and so they take an iterable (a fancy word for list)
2013-02-19 21:56:25	lewisrjc	?
2013-02-19 21:56:28	lewisrjc	can I see the assignment?
2013-02-19 21:56:37	lewisrjc	the syntax for for loops is
2013-02-19 21:56:53	lewisrjc	for variablename in range:
2013-02-19 21:57:02	lewisrjc	note the colon at the end, that's important
2013-02-19 21:57:37	lewisrjc	while loops are based on a statement being true (boolean expression)
2013-02-19 21:57:52	lewisrjc	their syntax is while booleanexpression:
2013-02-19 21:58:10	lewisrjc	note the colon, it's important (I am going to harp on that since you are missing some colons)
2013-02-19 21:58:32	User391	http://moodle.svcs.cs.pdx.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=374
2013-02-19 21:58:35	lewisrjc	foreach loops do what ever the contents on the loop has on each element in the list
2013-02-19 21:58:36	User391	let me know if you can't open it
2013-02-19 21:59:28	User391	that is the assignment
2013-02-19 22:01:08	lewisrjc	hrmm
2013-02-19 22:01:12	lewisrjc	bart is back at it I see
2013-02-19 22:01:14	lewisrjc	allright
2013-02-19 22:01:17	User391	lol
2013-02-19 22:01:20	User391	what do you mean?
2013-02-19 22:01:20	lewisrjc	so the boolean thing is important
2013-02-19 22:01:42	User391	i don't see why i should use a while loop as opposed to a for loop
2013-02-19 22:01:46	User391	both use boolian expressions
2013-02-19 22:01:50	lewisrjc	just I like him a lot, but there's more to this assignment then I suspect you realize (there's a game theoretic background)
2013-02-19 22:01:53	lewisrjc	no
2013-02-19 22:01:53	lewisrjc	nonononon
2013-02-19 22:01:55	lewisrjc	they do not
2013-02-19 22:02:01	lewisrjc	for i in list:
2013-02-19 22:02:07	User391	oooo right
2013-02-19 22:02:09	lewisrjc	as opposed to while boolean:
2013-02-19 22:02:10	User391	I get it!!!
2013-02-19 22:02:12	User391	never mind
2013-02-19 22:02:14	lewisrjc	list and boolean are different
2013-02-19 22:02:19	lewisrjc	this works in C
2013-02-19 22:02:24	User391	for loops  can be more than true or false
2013-02-19 22:02:28	lewisrjc	just, as why I am confused
2013-02-19 22:02:37	lewisrjc	so let's go with an example
2013-02-19 22:02:47	lewisrjc	l = [1,2,3,4]
2013-02-19 22:03:09	lewisrjc	l is now a variable, it's contents are the list [1,2,3,4]
2013-02-19 22:03:32	lewisrjc	now let's say I want to add 1 to each element of that list
2013-02-19 22:03:37	lewisrjc	for i in l:
2013-02-19 22:03:51	lewisrjc	    i++
2013-02-19 22:04:18	User391	i++
2013-02-19 22:04:18	User391	?
2013-02-19 22:04:29	lewisrjc	actually that won't work, but ignore that fact for the time being because it's based on a kind of subtle fact
2013-02-19 22:04:46	lewisrjc	let's print out every element of the list + 1, that makes a little more sense
2013-02-19 22:04:52	lewisrjc	so it would be for i in l:
2013-02-19 22:05:01	lewisrjc	  print(i+1)
2013-02-19 22:05:30	lewisrjc	(++ stands for increment by one, don't use it, I forgot python got rid of that stuff)
2013-02-19 22:05:36	lewisrjc	now this loop
2013-02-19 22:05:39	lewisrjc	for i in l:
2013-02-19 22:05:45	lewisrjc	    print(i+1)
2013-02-19 22:06:27	lewisrjc	what happens is every element of l is, item by item, assigned to i, and then the block of code below the for statement get's executed with the new value in i
2013-02-19 22:06:43	lewisrjc	so first i is assigned to 1, then to 2, 3, 4 and then the loop terminates
2013-02-19 22:06:50	lewisrjc	following so far?
2013-02-19 22:06:53	User391	yes
2013-02-19 22:08:32	lewisrjc	so then all a while loop does is test a boolean expression, if the boolean expression returns true, the block of code executes, and this continues until the expression terminates
2013-02-19 22:08:38	lewisrjc	returns false that is
2013-02-19 22:08:42	User391	yes
2013-02-19 22:08:43	User391	got it
2013-02-19 22:08:43	lewisrjc	so consider the following
2013-02-19 22:08:49	lewisrjc	index = 0
2013-02-19 22:08:56	lewisrjc	while index < len(l):
2013-02-19 22:09:00	User391	hang on
2013-02-19 22:09:06	User391	index=0
2013-02-19 22:09:19	lewisrjc	    print(l[index])
2013-02-19 22:09:35	lewisrjc	index=0 assigns a new variable (named index) to be the value of 0
2013-02-19 22:09:39	User391	now, this just serves as an anchor for the whole program, right?
2013-02-19 22:09:52	lewisrjc	no idea what that means,
2013-02-19 22:09:56	lewisrjc	explain anchor
2013-02-19 22:10:03	lewisrjc	explin whole program
2013-02-19 22:10:45	User391	oh so for you, index is just another variable, like x?
2013-02-19 22:11:40	lewisrjc	yes
2013-02-19 22:11:43	User391	k got it
2013-02-19 22:12:11	lewisrjc	this is a code snippet, it's a chunk of code out of context. It could be a part of a larger program, but we are examining it in isolation
2013-02-19 22:12:19	User391	kk
2013-02-19 22:12:22	lewisrjc	so it may not quite run without some help
2013-02-19 22:12:28	lewisrjc	index = 0
2013-02-19 22:12:32	lewisrjc	while index < len(l):
2013-02-19 22:12:37	lewisrjc	    print(l[index])
2013-02-19 22:12:45	lewisrjc	so index = 0
2013-02-19 22:13:05	lewisrjc	and then we test if that is less then the len(l), which is 4
2013-02-19 22:13:25	User391	how is len(l) 4?
2013-02-19 22:13:37	lewisrjc	l is the variable I assigned above
2013-02-19 22:13:38	lewisrjc	sorry
2013-02-19 22:13:55	lewisrjc	l = [1,2,3,4]
2013-02-19 22:13:58	User391	l = 1,2,3,4
2013-02-19 22:13:59	User391	okay
2013-02-19 22:14:00	lewisrjc	yeah
2013-02-19 22:14:08	User391	i know that
2013-02-19 22:14:36	lewisrjc	now, on the next pass, index is 0, so it prints the 1st element
2013-02-19 22:14:36	User391	sorry not trying to be snappy
2013-02-19 22:14:41	lewisrjc	yeah it's fine
2013-02-19 22:14:52	lewisrjc	so with this loop it never ends
2013-02-19 22:15:00	lewisrjc	becase index never increments
2013-02-19 22:15:11	User391	increments?
2013-02-19 22:15:14	lewisrjc	now, alternatively consider
2013-02-19 22:15:18	lewisrjc	l = [1,2,3,4]
2013-02-19 22:15:23	lewisrjc	index = 0
2013-02-19 22:15:30	lewisrjc	while index < len(l):
2013-02-19 22:15:37	User391	ooo right
2013-02-19 22:15:40	lewisrjc	    print(l[index]
2013-02-19 22:15:50	lewisrjc	    index=index+1
2013-02-19 22:16:03	lewisrjc	now, every pass through index is being incremented
2013-02-19 22:16:25	User391	so the first time around, index = 1
2013-02-19 22:16:31	User391	then 2, then 3, then 4
2013-02-19 22:16:33	User391	and it never stops
2013-02-19 22:16:35	User391	right?
2013-02-19 22:16:58	lewisrjc	first time it's 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 < len(l) is false so it stops
2013-02-19 22:17:45	lewisrjc	len(l) is 4
2013-02-19 22:17:52	User391	oh right
2013-02-19 22:17:56	lewisrjc	so 4<4 is false
2013-02-19 22:18:08	User391	ok
2013-02-19 22:18:25	lewisrjc	the point of this exercise was to show that for loops can be made in terms of while loops
2013-02-19 22:18:30	lewisrjc	but that is considered bad form
2013-02-19 22:18:45	lewisrjc	because you are doing a whole bunch of work that for does for you
2013-02-19 22:19:01	lewisrjc	the general rule of thumb is as follows
2013-02-19 22:19:14	User391	hmm okay
2013-02-19 22:19:16	lewisrjc	consider "do I know when this loop ends before I start it"
2013-02-19 22:19:24	User391	k
2013-02-19 22:19:26	lewisrjc	if the answer to this question is "yes"
2013-02-19 22:19:29	lewisrjc	then you want a for
2013-02-19 22:19:35	lewisrjc	if it's no, then you want a while loop
2013-02-19 22:19:46	User391	got it
2013-02-19 22:20:38	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:20:40	lewisrjc	so now then
2013-02-19 22:20:45	lewisrjc	with if/else statements
2013-02-19 22:20:50	lewisrjc	you again need the :
2013-02-19 22:20:55	lewisrjc	so the syntax is
2013-02-19 22:20:59	lewisrjc	if boolean:
2013-02-19 22:21:02	lewisrjc	else:
2013-02-19 22:21:09	lewisrjc	with code in between
2013-02-19 22:21:27	User391	okay, i'm looking at my program now
2013-02-19 22:21:46	lewisrjc	oh right
2013-02-19 22:21:47	lewisrjc	also
2013-02-19 22:21:50	lewisrjc	= is assignemtn
2013-02-19 22:21:56	lewisrjc	however you spell that
2013-02-19 22:22:01	lewisrjc	== is "test equal"
2013-02-19 22:22:07	User391	hmm
2013-02-19 22:22:11	User391	okay == is mathematical
2013-02-19 22:22:17	lewisrjc	uh, boolean
2013-02-19 22:22:21	lewisrjc	it's all math
2013-02-19 22:22:21	haus	does python have === ? (just to confuse everything)
2013-02-19 22:22:24	lewisrjc	no
2013-02-19 22:22:30	haus	good
2013-02-19 22:22:41	User391	whoa so many people!
2013-02-19 22:22:47	haus	muahaha
2013-02-19 22:22:48	lewisrjc	== is reference quals I think
2013-02-19 22:23:02	lewisrjc	if you type /name you will see a list of everyone in the channel
2013-02-19 22:23:13	lewisrjc	it's currently around 50 odd people
2013-02-19 22:23:20	lewisrjc	hence the concern about plagarism
2013-02-19 22:23:33	lewisrjc	this haus feller, he aint to trustworthy and might steal your code
2013-02-19 22:23:38	User391	lol
2013-02-19 22:23:41	User391	okay
2013-02-19 22:23:57	lewisrjc	(he's actually a good bloke)
2013-02-19 22:23:58	User391	haus, you probably don't want my code anyway!
2013-02-19 22:23:59	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:24:02	Wren	User391: The people with Plusses in front of their names are official CS tutors
2013-02-19 22:24:15	User391	cool
2013-02-19 22:24:16	Wren	And krinkle is the coordinator.
2013-02-19 22:24:21	lewisrjc	aka Da Boss
2013-02-19 22:24:22	haus	User391: but i need it for my collection
2013-02-19 22:24:25	lewisrjc	anyways
2013-02-19 22:24:26	Wren	But lots of people are willing to help
2013-02-19 22:24:29	User391	lol
2013-02-19 22:24:38	User391	you guys are cRAzy
2013-02-19 22:24:49	haus	it's late, so i get loopy
2013-02-19 22:24:55	lewisrjc	not even drunk
2013-02-19 22:25:01	haus	not yet
2013-02-19 22:25:02	lewisrjc	haus, go golf this code
2013-02-19 22:25:19	lewisrjc	so, in you if compguess = 1
2013-02-19 22:25:27	lewisrjc	you want if compguess == 1:
2013-02-19 22:25:48	lewisrjc	because currently you are assigning compguess to 1 and then wandering off the cliff
2013-02-19 22:26:23	User391	idon't really understand the diff btwn == and =
2013-02-19 22:26:25	User391	i thought i did
2013-02-19 22:26:32	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:26:32	User391	hm
2013-02-19 22:26:44	lewisrjc	so you have a variable name compgues
2013-02-19 22:26:52	lewisrjc	you want to assign a value to it
2013-02-19 22:26:57	lewisrjc	you do
2013-02-19 22:27:02	lewisrjc	compguess = value
2013-02-19 22:27:12	lewisrjc	now you want to find out if compguess is 0
2013-02-19 22:27:19	lewisrjc	compguess == 0
2013-02-19 22:27:31	User391	so == is true or false
2013-02-19 22:27:32	User391	boolian
2013-02-19 22:27:39	lewisrjc	it's an operator
2013-02-19 22:27:40	lewisrjc	yeah
2013-02-19 22:27:41	User391	and = is variable assignment
2013-02-19 22:27:44	lewisrjc	yeah
2013-02-19 22:28:04	lewisrjc	so you know how a + b returns a number? i.e. 2+3 returns 5?
2013-02-19 22:28:06	lewisrjc	well
2013-02-19 22:28:15	lewisrjc	== is an operator, kind of the same
2013-02-19 22:28:26	lewisrjc	but instead of returning a number it returns a boolean
2013-02-19 22:28:31	User391	right
2013-02-19 22:28:32	User391	okay
2013-02-19 22:28:34	User391	got it
2013-02-19 22:28:46	lewisrjc	this is important because you can assign the result to a variable (which you will probably eventually want to do)
2013-02-19 22:28:49	lewisrjc	so if you do
2013-02-19 22:28:58	lewisrjc	my_varaible = 2 + 3
2013-02-19 22:29:03	User391	yeah i do at the end of the for loop
2013-02-19 22:29:07	lewisrjc	my_variable is 5
2013-02-19 22:29:22	lewisrjc	but if you do my_varaiable = 2 == 2
2013-02-19 22:29:26	lewisrjc	my_variable is true
2013-02-19 22:29:47	lewisrjc	so now then
2013-02-19 22:30:14	User391	okay now i want to write for len[guesses]<10:
2013-02-19 22:30:43	User391	that's supposed to be a boolian expression
2013-02-19 22:31:12	lewisrjc	for future reference there's a concept known as "iterative programming", the basic idea is instead of writing a whole program, you write a piece of a program and get it running, and then extend that program to have the next part of the assignment
2013-02-19 22:31:33	lewisrjc	it can be majorly helpful if only for the morale boost of having something working
2013-02-19 22:31:36	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:31:42	lewisrjc	well
2013-02-19 22:31:47	lewisrjc	len[guesses]<10
2013-02-19 22:31:52	lewisrjc	is a boolean expression
2013-02-19 22:32:13	lewisrjc	either you want a for loop with a list
2013-02-19 22:32:17	User391	yeah but for me to get the logical problem solving done
2013-02-19 22:32:20	User391	i need to write it all out
2013-02-19 22:32:26	User391	anyway . . .
2013-02-19 22:32:42	lewisrjc	or you want a while loop with a boolean
2013-02-19 22:32:47	 *	lewisrjc sighs
2013-02-19 22:32:53	lewisrjc	where's the old timers when you need them
2013-02-19 22:33:06	lewisrjc	so explain to me (in english) what this loop should do
2013-02-19 22:33:41	User391	i def want a for loop with a list
2013-02-19 22:33:56	User391	cuz i'm adding to a list of guesses
2013-02-19 22:33:59	lewisrjc	(one of the old tutor coordinators insisted everyone write out their entire program in english before he would help them for reference)
2013-02-19 22:34:02	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:34:31	lewisrjc	well, then you are going to have to add to the list of guesses
2013-02-19 22:34:34	lewisrjc	currently you aren't
2013-02-19 22:35:04	User391	yeah i wam
2013-02-19 22:35:07	User391	*am
2013-02-19 22:35:15	User391	If b == var1:             print("One penny for me.")             guesses.append(b)             len(c)+1
2013-02-19 22:35:17	User391	whops
2013-02-19 22:35:23	User391	I'm using the guesses.append(b)
2013-02-19 22:35:28	User391	function
2013-02-19 22:35:33	User391	after every input
2013-02-19 22:35:39	lewisrjc	oh
2013-02-19 22:35:49	User391	it's way down there
2013-02-19 22:35:50	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 22:35:52	lewisrjc	I see
2013-02-19 22:36:01	User391	does that make any sense, or am i totally to lunch?
2013-02-19 22:36:06	lewisrjc	no it does
2013-02-19 22:36:10	lewisrjc	you have scope bug
2013-02-19 22:36:19	lewisrjc	but that's not too big a deal
2013-02-19 22:36:26	lewisrjc	this isn't due tomorrow is it?
2013-02-19 22:36:40	User391	thursday at 5 pm
2013-02-19 22:36:45	User391	but i work full time all day
2013-02-19 22:36:51	User391	so yeah . . .
2013-02-19 22:37:11	User391	what does scope mean?
2013-02-19 22:37:18	User391	i need to move back into a while loop?
2013-02-19 22:37:21	lewisrjc	variable life time
2013-02-19 22:37:23	lewisrjc	uh, no
2013-02-19 22:37:25	User391	ooo
2013-02-19 22:37:29	lewisrjc	so if you have
2013-02-19 22:37:45	lewisrjc	if i = 2:
2013-02-19 22:37:48	lewisrjc	sorry
2013-02-19 22:37:50	lewisrjc	bleh
2013-02-19 22:37:56	lewisrjc	outervar = 2
2013-02-19 22:38:02	lewisrjc	if true:
2013-02-19 22:38:07	lewisrjc	   outervar =4
2013-02-19 22:38:17	lewisrjc	print(outervar)
2013-02-19 22:38:23	lewisrjc	what get's printed out
2013-02-19 22:38:34	User391	4
2013-02-19 22:38:38	lewisrjc	nope
2013-02-19 22:38:40	lewisrjc	try it
2013-02-19 22:38:47	User391	k one sec
2013-02-19 22:39:22	lewisrjc	oops
2013-02-19 22:39:27	lewisrjc	if True:
2013-02-19 22:40:11	User391	4 gets printed
2013-02-19 22:40:14	lewisrjc	oh, weird
2013-02-19 22:40:14	User391	why?
2013-02-19 22:40:22	User391	that's what i said!
2013-02-19 22:40:29	lewisrjc	because python is a dynamic language
2013-02-19 22:40:37	 *	lewisrjc needs to spend more time in the real world
2013-02-19 22:40:39	lewisrjc	sorry
2013-02-19 22:40:39	User391	variables can be changed
2013-02-19 22:40:47	User391	within python
2013-02-19 22:40:54	lewisrjc	been working in a another language that does things differently
2013-02-19 22:41:01	User391	yeah
2013-02-19 22:41:01	lewisrjc	so yes, you are correct
2013-02-19 22:41:28	User391	so what else is wrong with my program?
2013-02-19 22:41:37	User391	i can't seem to get the < 10 thing to work
2013-02-19 22:41:46	lewisrjc	so the real issue is the for lenguess]<=3
2013-02-19 22:41:51	lewisrjc	that shouldn't be a for loop
2013-02-19 22:42:04	lewisrjc	oh right
2013-02-19 22:42:06	User391	oh it should be a while loop
2013-02-19 22:42:06	lewisrjc	and that
2013-02-19 22:42:10	lewisrjc	nope
2013-02-19 22:42:13	lewisrjc	close though
2013-02-19 22:42:14	User391	none of my operands are working
2013-02-19 22:42:18	User391	If ??
2013-02-19 22:42:22	lewisrjc	yup
2013-02-19 22:42:25	User391	huh
2013-02-19 22:42:27	User391	weird
2013-02-19 22:42:34	User391	i'm looking in my book about if loops
2013-02-19 22:43:26	lewisrjc	if isn't a loop
2013-02-19 22:43:28	lewisrjc	it's a conditional
2013-02-19 22:44:24	User391	that sucks
2013-02-19 22:44:31	lewisrjc	?
2013-02-19 22:44:35	lewisrjc	different behavior
2013-02-19 22:44:44	lewisrjc	usually you have a loop wrapping your conditionals
2013-02-19 22:44:46	User391	so i can't say "While x <=3:"
2013-02-19 22:45:08	User391	it seems to me that conditionals don't persist as long as loops do
2013-02-19 22:45:11	User391	you know what i mean?
2013-02-19 22:45:13	lewisrjc	lower case
2013-02-19 22:45:17	User391	yesss
2013-02-19 22:45:18	User391	thanks
2013-02-19 22:45:20	lewisrjc	you can say that
2013-02-19 22:45:25	lewisrjc	and no they do not
2013-02-19 22:45:29	lewisrjc	that is the whole point
2013-02-19 22:45:33	User391	ooooooo
2013-02-19 22:45:38	lewisrjc	so with a while loop
2013-02-19 22:45:45	User391	compsci is so theorectical!
2013-02-19 22:45:48	lewisrjc	the code Keeps Getting Executed(tm)
2013-02-19 22:45:53	User391	i got it
2013-02-19 22:45:53	User391	okay
2013-02-19 22:46:04	lewisrjc	in if statements, the code either is, or is not, executed 1 time
2013-02-19 22:46:23	lewisrjc	you can make if statemnts out of while loops, and vice versa, so they are all, very, very related
2013-02-19 22:47:02	lewisrjc	I suspect you want guesses to be [] to start off with btw
2013-02-19 22:47:04	lewisrjc	so
2013-02-19 22:47:09	lewisrjc	guesses []
2013-02-19 22:47:10	lewisrjc	er
2013-02-19 22:47:13	lewisrjc	guesses = []
2013-02-19 22:47:19	lewisrjc	[] is the empty list
2013-02-19 22:47:31	lewisrjc	currently it is a list of length 1 with 0 being the initial value
2013-02-19 22:47:37	User391	i start my empty list with [0]
2013-02-19 22:47:43	User391	so that makes sense
2013-02-19 22:47:52	User391	guesses=[0]
2013-02-19 22:48:04	lewisrjc	uhh...well, you can do it that way
2013-02-19 22:48:12	lewisrjc	but len(guesses) is 1 to start off with...
2013-02-19 22:48:40	lewisrjc	umm
2013-02-19 22:48:44	lewisrjc	hmm
2013-02-19 22:48:45	User391	hang on 1 sec i think bart told us on the assignment we should do that
2013-02-19 22:48:47	User391	one sec
2013-02-19 22:48:51	User391	i'm reading the assnment
2013-02-19 22:50:03	User391	k never mind
2013-02-19 22:50:38	User391	i think i do want the initial len[guesses] ==0
2013-02-19 22:50:47	lewisrjc	that's a test
2013-02-19 22:50:50	lewisrjc	and it's parens
2013-02-19 22:50:58	lewisrjc	so len(guesses) == 0
2013-02-19 22:51:00	User391	tuple?
2013-02-19 22:51:05	lewisrjc	is probably the sytax you mean
2013-02-19 22:51:06	User391	cuz not maleable
2013-02-19 22:51:10	lewisrjc	mutable
2013-02-19 22:51:14	lewisrjc	um
2013-02-19 22:51:18	lewisrjc	well
2013-02-19 22:51:22	lewisrjc	the logic is not wrong
2013-02-19 22:51:44	lewisrjc	the way you intialize a list to be empty (or 0)
2013-02-19 22:51:49	lewisrjc	is with the syntax
2013-02-19 22:51:54	lewisrjc	mylist = []
2013-02-19 22:51:59	lewisrjc	that makes a list where
2013-02-19 22:52:07	lewisrjc	len(mylist) == 0
2013-02-19 22:52:08	lewisrjc	is true
2013-02-19 22:52:42	lewisrjc	one sec, I gotta go start laundry
2013-02-19 22:53:21	lewisrjc	so, one thing is to think about how you can tell if this program should end
2013-02-19 22:53:35	lewisrjc	I suspect you actually want the outermost loop to be a while loop
2013-02-19 22:53:37	User391	when len[guesses]=10
2013-02-19 22:53:46	User391	that's when it should end
2013-02-19 22:55:26	lewisrjc	yup
2013-02-19 22:55:31	lewisrjc	that's a boolean test
2013-02-19 22:55:34	lewisrjc	so you could say
2013-02-19 22:55:37	User391	i don't get why my nested for loops are bad
2013-02-19 22:55:49	User391	or why my
2013-02-19 22:55:50	User391	for len[guesses] < 10:
2013-02-19 22:55:51	User391	doesn't work
2013-02-19 22:55:51	lewisrjc	while len(guesses)<10
2013-02-19 22:55:59	lewisrjc	for doesn't take a boolean
2013-02-19 22:56:03	lewisrjc	it can not take a boolean
2013-02-19 22:56:06	lewisrjc	and it's parens
2013-02-19 22:56:12	lewisrjc	len(guesses)
2013-02-19 22:56:24	lewisrjc	for takes a list
2013-02-19 22:56:40	User391	okay, i thought it should be [ ] cuz it is mutable
2013-02-19 22:56:48	User391	and ( ) are not mutable
2013-02-19 22:56:52	User391	lists vs. tuples
2013-02-19 22:56:53	lewisrjc	oh
2013-02-19 22:56:56	lewisrjc	um
2013-02-19 22:56:58	User391	right?
2013-02-19 22:57:00	lewisrjc	oh
2013-02-19 22:57:03	lewisrjc	lol I get it
2013-02-19 22:57:05	lewisrjc	yes
2013-02-19 22:57:06	lewisrjc	but no
2013-02-19 22:57:10	lewisrjc	len(guesses)
2013-02-19 22:57:15	User391	!
2013-02-19 22:57:17	lewisrjc	is not tuple syntax
2013-02-19 22:57:23	User391	is that just just pthon syntax
2013-02-19 22:57:24	User391	?
2013-02-19 22:57:28	lewisrjc	(len,guesses)
2013-02-19 22:57:31	User391	thank you, that solves a lot
2013-02-19 22:57:34	lewisrjc	is tuple syntax
2013-02-19 22:57:44	User391	huh
2013-02-19 22:57:46	lewisrjc	if the parens FOLLOW something
2013-02-19 22:57:51	lewisrjc	it's a function call
2013-02-19 22:57:59	lewisrjc	so len is a function that takes one argument
2013-02-19 22:58:26	lewisrjc	so you are neither mutating nor not mutating something you are calling a function
2013-02-19 22:58:31	kini	and if [] follow something, it's an indexing
2013-02-19 22:59:06	lewisrjc	len is a function that takes a single argument and returns the length of that argument
2013-02-19 22:59:11	kini	for example if x is a list ['a','b','c'] then x[0] is an expression referring to the 0th element of the list (namely the letter 'a')
2013-02-19 22:59:34	lewisrjc	so foo = len(guesses) assigns the length of guesses to foo
2013-02-19 22:59:42	User391	i see
2013-02-19 22:59:43	User391	okay
2013-02-19 23:00:07	lewisrjc	there's a lot to this
2013-02-19 23:00:17	User391	yup
2013-02-19 23:00:30	lewisrjc	print is also a function
2013-02-19 23:00:48	lewisrjc	so no, for loops can never take a function
2013-02-19 23:00:53	lewisrjc	they can only take a list
2013-02-19 23:01:07	lewisrjc	or something that behaves like a list (which you make eventually run into)
2013-02-19 23:01:16	User391	what  do you mean by that?
2013-02-19 23:01:25	lewisrjc	um, other data structures
2013-02-19 23:01:33	lewisrjc	that aren't relevant
2013-02-19 23:01:37	User391	cuz i've been assigning functions all over the place
2013-02-19 23:01:58	lewisrjc	no, you have been assigning the results of a function all over the place
2013-02-19 23:02:02	lewisrjc	slight difference
2013-02-19 23:02:29	lewisrjc	but the for loops with a boolean expression will not work
2013-02-19 23:02:36	User391	okay, point taken
2013-02-19 23:02:54	User391	i must use "if" statements where I have operands
2013-02-19 23:02:56	User391	right?
2013-02-19 23:03:10	lewisrjc	uh, operands meaning for?
2013-02-19 23:03:11	lewisrjc	yes
2013-02-19 23:03:23	User391	yeah
2013-02-19 23:03:29	User391	crap
2013-02-19 23:03:37	User391	how about a while statement instead?
2013-02-19 23:03:43	User391	i have to rewrite my whole program
2013-02-19 23:04:11	User391	the problem with an if statement is that two can be true at the same time
2013-02-19 23:04:16	User391	i prefer to use a while loop
2013-02-19 23:04:17	lewisrjc	nononono
2013-02-19 23:04:26	lewisrjc	do not rewrite
2013-02-19 23:04:28	lewisrjc	this is
2013-02-19 23:04:29	lewisrjc	SO
2013-02-19 23:04:35	lewisrjc	very close to being right
2013-02-19 23:04:52	lewisrjc	in fact it's so close it is actually revealing a lot about psychology
2013-02-19 23:05:00	User391	LOL
2013-02-19 23:05:00	lewisrjc	anyways
2013-02-19 23:05:19	 *	lewisrjc makes assumptions about the meaning of words, you are showing that those assumptions are wrong
2013-02-19 23:05:22	lewisrjc	so
2013-02-19 23:05:26	lewisrjc	you are correct
2013-02-19 23:05:32	lewisrjc	2 if statements could be true
2013-02-19 23:05:34	lewisrjc	but
2013-02-19 23:05:42	lewisrjc	wait, there's something to the rescue
2013-02-19 23:05:46	lewisrjc	the else statement
2013-02-19 23:05:50	lewisrjc	if mybool1:
2013-02-19 23:05:53	lewisrjc	else:
2013-02-19 23:06:10	lewisrjc	are mutually exclusive, so, one can execute, or the other
2013-02-19 23:06:13	lewisrjc	but never both
2013-02-19 23:06:19	lewisrjc	but what's that?
2013-02-19 23:06:32	lewisrjc	you need multiple if statement tests?
2013-02-19 23:06:42	User391	yup
2013-02-19 23:06:50	lewisrjc	the elif is your friend
2013-02-19 23:06:57	lewisrjc	if mybool1:
2013-02-19 23:07:02	lewisrjc	elif mybool2:
2013-02-19 23:07:06	lewisrjc	else:
2013-02-19 23:07:11	lewisrjc	the last else is optional
2013-02-19 23:08:26	lewisrjc	oh the count(H) is also wrong
2013-02-19 23:10:54	lewisrjc	oh huh, that's a method
2013-02-19 23:10:58	lewisrjc	never knew that
2013-02-19 23:11:33	lewisrjc	so the actual syntax is mylist.count(elementtocount)
2013-02-19 23:11:40	lewisrjc	or rather
2013-02-19 23:11:48	lewisrjc	myvar = mylist.count(elementtocount
2013-02-19 23:11:54	lewisrjc	and you need to quote the H
2013-02-19 23:11:59	lewisrjc	so it's 'H'
2013-02-19 23:12:12	lewisrjc	not a raw H (that is grabbing a variable named H, which doesn't exist
2013-02-19 23:12:17	User391	just like i quote it when assigning it to a variable
2013-02-19 23:12:19	User391	cool cool
2013-02-19 23:12:19	User391	thanks
2013-02-19 23:12:23	lewisrjc	yes
2013-02-19 23:12:34	lewisrjc	if it's a literal text, always quote
2013-02-19 23:12:41	User391	what do you mean by that?
2013-02-19 23:12:46	lewisrjc	i.e.
2013-02-19 23:12:56	lewisrjc	myvar = "myvar"
2013-02-19 23:13:04	lewisrjc	the unquoted thing is python code
2013-02-19 23:13:31	lewisrjc	the quoted thing is a word that I don't want to be python code, I want it to bethe actual word myvar
2013-02-19 23:14:18	lewisrjc	so the idea behind the count thing
2013-02-19 23:14:33	lewisrjc	is you have a list, in your case it's assigned to the variable guesses
2013-02-19 23:14:45	lewisrjc	if you want to take some action on that variable
2013-02-19 23:14:48	lewisrjc	like count it
2013-02-19 23:15:03	lewisrjc	or append to it
2013-02-19 23:15:20	lewisrjc	you do variable.action()
2013-02-19 23:16:03	User391	yeah i have that already in guesses.append(b)
2013-02-19 23:16:19	User391	so what do you mean by "if it's a literal text, always quote" ???
2013-02-19 23:16:28	lewisrjc	um
2013-02-19 23:16:37	lewisrjc	so there is python text and not python text
2013-02-19 23:16:47	lewisrjc	the stuff you print is not python text
2013-02-19 23:16:51	lewisrjc	it doesn't get executed
2013-02-19 23:17:12	lewisrjc	it is a string of characters, not some python code to be interpreted
2013-02-19 23:17:29	User391	ooo
2013-02-19 23:17:36	lewisrjc	if you want the character 'h'
2013-02-19 23:17:42	User391	so the quotation marks encasing a variable allow the variable to be unlocked?
2013-02-19 23:17:50	lewisrjc	rather than the variable h
2013-02-19 23:17:50	User391	and processed and printed?
2013-02-19 23:17:56	User391	yes okay
2013-02-19 23:18:04	lewisrjc	python doesn't do string interpolation does it?
2013-02-19 23:18:14	lewisrjc	one sec
2013-02-19 23:18:17	lewisrjc	I might be a liar
2013-02-19 23:18:33	lewisrjc	no it doesnt
2013-02-19 23:18:35	lewisrjc	phew
2013-02-19 23:18:40	lewisrjc	thought I was going nuts
2013-02-19 23:18:43	lewisrjc	so if you do
2013-02-19 23:18:53	lewisrjc	myvar=5
2013-02-19 23:19:01	lewisrjc	print("myvar")
2013-02-19 23:19:05	lewisrjc	what get's printed
2013-02-19 23:19:09	lewisrjc	as opposed to
2013-02-19 23:19:13	lewisrjc	myvar=5
2013-02-19 23:19:16	lewisrjc	print(myvar)
2013-02-19 23:21:31	User391	will print 5?
2013-02-19 23:22:00	User391	i hope so anyway
2013-02-19 23:22:03	lewisrjc	yup
2013-02-19 23:22:08	lewisrjc	the second one will print 5
2013-02-19 23:22:12	lewisrjc	the first one will print
2013-02-19 23:22:14	lewisrjc	myvar
2013-02-19 23:25:04	User391	okay so i have another issue
2013-02-19 23:25:07	User391	ugh
2013-02-19 23:25:09	User391	i'm so close
2013-02-19 23:25:17	lewisrjc	mmhmm
2013-02-19 23:25:18	User391	and i haven't even done the bonus quesitons
2013-02-19 23:25:32	lewisrjc	one step at a tme
2013-02-19 23:25:46	User391	i figured it out!
2013-02-19 23:26:26	lewisrjc	good
2013-02-19 23:28:29	User391	i can't get my elif statement to work now
2013-02-19 23:28:30	User391	wtf
2013-02-19 23:28:32	User391	sorry!
2013-02-19 23:28:38	lewisrjc	hmm
2013-02-19 23:28:46	lewisrjc	why don't you send me your code
2013-02-19 23:28:52	User391	elif mood == 2:
2013-02-19 23:28:59	lewisrjc	lc@cs.pdx.edu is my email
2013-02-19 23:29:29	User391	oo duh
2013-02-19 23:29:34	User391	i can't use elif on an operational clause
2013-02-19 23:29:53	lewisrjc	operational clause?
2013-02-19 23:32:58	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-19 23:33:07	lewisrjc	I have to get some sleep since I work tomorrow
2013-02-19 23:33:08	User391	k just sent it
2013-02-19 23:33:12	lewisrjc	you should do so as wel
2013-02-19 23:33:21	lewisrjc	herpd erp
2013-02-19 23:34:25	lewisrjc	ooh
2013-02-19 23:34:30	lewisrjc	goody goody gumdrops
2013-02-19 23:34:36	lewisrjc	elif comes after an if
2013-02-19 23:34:37	lewisrjc	not a while
2013-02-19 23:35:04	lewisrjc	also all those len[guesses] should be len(guesses)
2013-02-19 23:35:10	lewisrjc	otherwise looks mostly good
2013-02-19 23:36:14	User391	the book is wrong!
2013-02-19 23:36:21	User391	it doesn't say we need an if before an elif!
2013-02-19 23:39:44	lewisrjc	that's actually possible
2013-02-19 23:40:38	lewisrjc	all irght
2013-02-19 23:40:44	lewisrjc	I actually have to go to bed
2013-02-19 23:40:48	lewisrjc	so I will tell you this
2013-02-19 23:41:02	lewisrjc	you have another for where you want at the end of the program
2013-02-19 23:41:15	lewisrjc	also, instead of \n you want '\n'
2013-02-19 23:41:33	lewisrjc	and you can't just have strings right next to each other
2013-02-19 23:41:42	lewisrjc	so you want "foo" + "bar"
2013-02-19 23:41:47	lewisrjc	rather than "foo" "bar"
2013-02-19 23:41:47	User391	right right right
2013-02-19 23:41:52	User391	okay yeah i should go to bed too
2013-02-19 23:41:55	User391	work eary in the am!
2013-02-19 23:41:58	User391	thanks so muchf or all your help!!
2013-02-19 23:42:04	lewisrjc	um, there's some other stuff too
2013-02-19 23:42:08	lewisrjc	but it can wait
2013-02-19 23:42:10	lewisrjc	yeah
2013-02-19 23:42:12	lewisrjc	take care
2013-02-19 23:42:16	User391	u too!

2013-02-20 13:09:38	shakya	Hi there, is this computer science tutoring?
2013-02-20 13:10:30	@krinkle	shakya: how can we help you?
2013-02-20 13:11:01	shakya	I just had some general questions regarding to your services
2013-02-20 13:11:22	shakya	I am currently working on data structures and ADT
2013-02-20 13:12:07	shakya	I read the text but I have a hard time understanding it. I was wondering if I came in to the tutoring sessions that I could receive a step by step lecture on the topic
2013-02-20 13:13:25	@krinkle	shakya: we can try to help enhance your understanding, but we are not a replacement for the class lectures
2013-02-20 13:14:00	shakya	I see. That's what I was afraid of.
2013-02-20 13:14:20	shakya	I'm actually willing to pay hourly for a tutor for that specific purpose.
2013-02-20 13:15:37	@krinkle	we do not offer paid private tutoring. But you are welcome to bring your questions to us and we can do our best to answer them.
2013-02-20 13:17:23	shakya	I understand. One more question, I am a PSU student but taking the prerequisites of computer science at PCC. Would it be alright for me to receive tutoring?
2013-02-20 13:19:28	@krinkle	Unfortunately no, since we are not familiar with the CS courses at PCC we cannot offer tutoring for PCC students. Moreover, students paying PSU for CS classes must be given top priority. But I believe that PCC has computer science tutoring, they may be able to better meet your needs.
2013-02-20 13:20:44	shakya	Alright. Thank you for helping. Take care.

2013-02-20 21:32:41	User299	hello
2013-02-20 21:32:53	User299	i'm the girl from last night working on the penny matching game
2013-02-20 21:36:08	Wren	Hello.
2013-02-20 21:39:31	User299	hi
2013-02-20 21:39:53	User299	i'm not sure what exactly this bonus questions wants us to do.
2013-02-20 21:39:56	User299	Bonus Version (not required): Another predictor that is useful is whether the human player often changes their answer from turn to turn. (Humans tend to do this too much.) Make a new version of your program that predicts that the human will give a different answer than last time with probability equal to the fraction of times that they have given different answers in the past.
2013-02-20 21:41:10	User299	should the program print out its prediction that the human will make a novel choice (as compared to the last human choice)?
2013-02-20 21:41:27	User299	or should this prediction influence the computer's penny guess?
2013-02-20 21:43:11	stormcrow	It looks like it's just asking for the first one.
2013-02-20 21:43:26	User299	okay
2013-02-20 21:43:31	User299	thanks for your help interpreting that
2013-02-20 21:43:52	stormcrow	You're welcome (though I won't guarantee my correctness in that)
2013-02-20 21:44:02	User299	it's nice to have a second opinion
2013-02-20 21:44:43	stormcrow	Fair enough
2013-02-20 21:45:40	User299	now i'm trying to debug my non-bonus code
2013-02-20 21:46:40	User299	i'm in CS161 python btw
2013-02-20 21:55:37	User299	so i'm having a syntax error
2013-02-20 21:55:40	User299	with this line:
2013-02-20 21:55:53	User299	  for(len(guesses)<=3):
2013-02-20 21:56:37	User299	i'm so close, but it just won't run
2013-02-20 21:57:47	User299	hello?
2013-02-20 21:58:16	stormcrow	OK, it looks like you got a lesson in loops last night, right?
2013-02-20 21:58:20	User299	yes
2013-02-20 21:59:20	stormcrow	Cool. Do you remember the difference between for loops and while loops?
2013-02-20 21:59:41	User299	while loops are boolian
2013-02-20 21:59:51	User299	for loops can have else and if and elif statements
2013-02-20 22:00:43	User299	not if statements!
2013-02-20 22:00:54	User299	wait, yes, if statements
2013-02-20 22:01:34	stormcrow	er, wait, can they have if statements? I don't think they can, but it's possible it's some detail of the language I'm not thinking of
2013-02-20 22:03:15	stormcrow	they can have else statements, but I don't think they can have if statements in the loop definition
2013-02-20 22:03:36	stormcrow	anyway, that's not the problem I'm seeing here (though it is something to research later)
2013-02-20 22:03:53	User299	if "if statements" can be in while loops?
2013-02-20 22:05:20	stormcrow	while loops kind of are like repeating if statements, but you can have if statements in the body of the loop
2013-02-20 22:05:37	stormcrow	that aside though, I want you to take another look at the condition you have in that for loop
2013-02-20 22:06:15	stormcrow	describe to me what it's supposed to be doing
2013-02-20 22:07:10	User299	well, to start off with, I have a while loop that says
2013-02-20 22:07:20	User299	when the lenth of guesses is 10 or less,
2013-02-20 22:07:33	lewisrjc	umm
2013-02-20 22:07:44	User299	and then i set my variables for guesses and computerwins and playerwins and the lengths of those
2013-02-20 22:07:47	User299	and then i say
2013-02-20 22:08:12	User299	When (for loop begins) length of guess <=3
2013-02-20 22:08:19	stormcrow	lewisrjc: you might be the better person to continue the work from last night, if you want to take over
2013-02-20 22:08:28	lewisrjc	for loops take...
2013-02-20 22:08:34	lewisrjc	for loops take a list
2013-02-20 22:08:36	lewisrjc	not an if
2013-02-20 22:08:55	User299	never an if?
2013-02-20 22:09:01	lewisrjc	you can put an if statement in the middle of a loop
2013-02-20 22:09:02	User299	okay sorry
2013-02-20 22:09:06	lewisrjc	for i in list:
2013-02-20 22:09:09	lewisrjc	   code
2013-02-20 22:09:20	lewisrjc	code can contain if statements
2013-02-20 22:09:36	lewisrjc	i is a literal varaible named i, you can name it whatever you want
2013-02-20 22:09:39	lewisrjc	list is your list
2013-02-20 22:09:53	lewisrjc	this is the ONLY way you use a for loops
2013-02-20 22:10:11	lewisrjc	(that's technically not true, don't worry about how it's not
2013-02-20 22:10:51	lewisrjc	)
2013-02-20 22:11:00	User299	okay so in this part of code, i actually am using a list though
2013-02-20 22:11:09	lewisrjc	guesses is a list
2013-02-20 22:11:16	User299	for(len(guesses)
2013-02-20 22:11:18	User299	exactly
2013-02-20 22:11:26	lewisrjc	len(guesses) is not a list
2013-02-20 22:11:44	User299	yeah i have that as a for loop already
2013-02-20 22:11:51	User299	OOOOO
2013-02-20 22:11:53	lewisrjc	len(guesses) is an integer
2013-02-20 22:12:04	User299	my beginning loop should be a for loop not a while loop
2013-02-20 22:12:14	User299	oooo not a list
2013-02-20 22:12:19	User299	it's a single integer
2013-02-20 22:12:25	User299	the length is a measurement, a single integer
2013-02-20 22:12:29	User299	guesses is a list
2013-02-20 22:12:31	lewisrjc	can you email me your code?
2013-02-20 22:12:33	lewisrjc	and yes
2013-02-20 22:12:33	User299	but len(guesses) is not
2013-02-20 22:12:35	lewisrjc	correct
2013-02-20 22:12:37	lewisrjc	yes
2013-02-20 22:12:38	User299	oooo man!
2013-02-20 22:12:46	lewisrjc	foo = len(guesss)
2013-02-20 22:12:51	lewisrjc	foo is an integer
2013-02-20 22:13:03	lewisrjc	does not work in a for loop OR a while loop in python
2013-02-20 22:13:10	lewisrjc	foo = guesses
2013-02-20 22:13:49	lewisrjc	guesses is a list, works for for loops not while loops
2013-02-20 22:14:02	lewisrjc	for loops are used to perform an action on every element of a list
2013-02-20 22:14:04	lewisrjc	i.e.
2013-02-20 22:14:05	lewisrjc	foreach
2013-02-20 22:14:36	lewisrjc	I believe you are (legitamately, but unusually) reading for as in "for this statement being true, take this action)
2013-02-20 22:14:48	lewisrjc	this is not the correct frame of thought
2013-02-20 22:15:10	User299	okay
2013-02-20 22:15:13	User299	that was my thought process
2013-02-20 22:15:16	User299	sorry
2013-02-20 22:15:20	lewisrjc	"for every item on this list, do something" is the mentality of for loops
2013-02-20 22:15:31	lewisrjc	"if this statement is true, take this action"
2013-02-20 22:15:35	lewisrjc	don't be sorry
2013-02-20 22:15:53	lewisrjc	that was literally one of the most amazing interpretations of code I have seen in...3 years?
2013-02-20 22:16:10	lewisrjc	it's completely legitimate, very reasonable and very interesting
2013-02-20 22:16:14	lewisrjc	and completely wrong
2013-02-20 22:16:27	lewisrjc	I want to go and make a language where it works now
2013-02-20 22:16:52	lewisrjc	anyways, seriously though, being confused is not something to be ashamed of
2013-02-20 22:17:03	lewisrjc	it's something to come to IRC and bug people into helping you over
2013-02-20 22:17:06	lewisrjc	oh wait...
2013-02-20 22:17:09	lewisrjc	:)
2013-02-20 22:17:12	lewisrjc	so yes
2013-02-20 22:17:18	stormcrow	we all start out confused at the beginning
2013-02-20 22:17:32	User299	lol
2013-02-20 22:17:45	Wren	We never actually stop being confused.
2013-02-20 22:18:06	Wren	Wait till you get to recursion!
2013-02-20 22:18:11	lewisrjc	well, some of us do, but it takes...an unusual sacrifice
2013-02-20 22:18:19	lewisrjc	Wren: no spoilers :/
2013-02-20 22:18:31	lewisrjc	so for loop is "for each item in this list, do something"
2013-02-20 22:18:33	lewisrjc	while is
2013-02-20 22:18:43	lewisrjc	"while this statement is true"
2013-02-20 22:18:48	lewisrjc	do something
2013-02-20 22:19:25	lewisrjc	if is "if this statement is true, do something, elif this second statement is true do something second, else do seomthing unrelated"
2013-02-20 22:20:06	lewisrjc	those are your three fundamental control statements in python, they will conditionally execute some amount of code some number of times
2013-02-20 22:21:19	lewisrjc	it turns out (dirty little secret) you can define any one in terms of any other, so they are really just window dressing around verious problems
2013-02-20 22:21:41	User299	ok
2013-02-20 22:22:21	 *	lewisrjc ->getting beer, you can send me your code at lc@cs.pdx.edu, and ask any questions you want
2013-02-20 22:22:43	User299	i don't even know
2013-02-20 22:23:51	User299	okay thanks
2013-02-20 22:25:11	lewisrjc	I don't even the whole thing all night
2013-02-20 22:27:49	lewisrjc	so if you want code to be run multiple times you use a loop, if you want it to be run once you use a conditional(if else)
2013-02-20 22:27:58	lewisrjc	oh man you cleaned this up nice
2013-02-20 22:28:55	lewisrjc	all right so first off, the outermost code flow is a while loop, I will just tell you that
2013-02-20 22:31:45	lewisrjc	hmm
2013-02-20 22:32:04	lewisrjc	all right let's start off at the top
2013-02-20 22:32:10	lewisrjc	to assign you use =
2013-02-20 22:32:14	lewisrjc	to test you use ==
2013-02-20 22:32:28	lewisrjc	do you want to assign to a,c,d or test them?
2013-02-20 22:32:42	lewisrjc	if you do test them do you want to use the result of that test?
2013-02-20 22:33:25	lewisrjc	you havea syntax error at the bottom, you missed quoting a \n
2013-02-20 22:33:52	lewisrjc	on line 24 you have a major error
2013-02-20 22:34:16	lewisrjc	you are assigning to a function call which basically doesn't make sense in python
2013-02-20 22:34:29	lewisrjc	the way count works is you call it on your list as a method
2013-02-20 22:34:32	lewisrjc	so the syntax is
2013-02-20 22:34:41	lewisrjc	mylist.count(elementtocount)
2013-02-20 22:34:51	lewisrjc	where elementtocount is whatever you want to count
2013-02-20 22:35:21	User299	i want to assign a c and d
2013-02-20 22:35:28	lewisrjc	you then assign this to a variable using =
2013-02-20 22:35:30	lewisrjc	Yes
2013-02-20 22:35:35	lewisrjc	which means you use = or ==?
2013-02-20 22:35:57	lewisrjc	oh and 37-48 are indented one level too deep, I suspect that's just a formatting error
2013-02-20 22:36:11	lewisrjc	formatting has semantic meaning in python(bizarrely)
2013-02-20 22:37:17	lewisrjc	and I suspect you are missing a line after 28
2013-02-20 22:37:40	lewisrjc	oh and 36 should be two lines
2013-02-20 22:37:41	lewisrjc	print
2013-02-20 22:37:43	lewisrjc	then input
2013-02-20 22:37:57	lewisrjc	after that it's runtime errors...
2013-02-20 22:38:28	lewisrjc	(compwins and playerwins are never assigned to BTW, I suspect you meant to append to them at some point, which implies initializing them)
2013-02-20 22:39:07	lewisrjc	that...should be enough to keep you busy for a while, I am going to catch a shower
2013-02-20 22:40:21	User299	thanks
2013-02-20 22:59:54	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-20 23:00:13	lewisrjc	my reccomendation and professional opinion is that you should make sure you get some sleep
2013-02-20 23:00:26	User299	not happening tonight
2013-02-20 23:00:31	User299	i have to get it done tonight
2013-02-20 23:00:35	lewisrjc	there are extensive studies that have linked sleep to learning and retention
2013-02-20 23:00:46	User299	i know, my dad is a sleep doctor
2013-02-20 23:00:51	User299	:)
2013-02-20 23:00:51	 *	lewisrjc is not a doctor, but hands out advice anyways
2013-02-20 23:00:53	lewisrjc	lol
2013-02-20 23:00:55	lewisrjc	awesome
2013-02-20 23:01:03	User299	the cobbler's kids go barefoot!!
2013-02-20 23:01:09	lewisrjc	indeed
2013-02-20 23:01:23	User299	yeah, i'm either taking the class on little sleep, or not taking it at all
2013-02-20 23:01:28	 *	lewisrjc just learned about those studies and has been using them as an excuse
2013-02-20 23:01:30	lewisrjc	well
2013-02-20 23:01:34	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-20 23:02:08	User299	yeah actually i'm glad i'm taking this class
2013-02-20 23:02:11	User299	i'm learning a lot
2013-02-20 23:02:19	User299	it's totally different from anything i've ever done before
2013-02-20 23:02:29	User299	so that's good for brain plasticity
2013-02-20 23:02:38	lewisrjc	yeah, I will tell you this, turn in what you have regardless of how well it works
2013-02-20 23:02:48	User299	it doesn't work at all
2013-02-20 23:02:49	User299	lol
2013-02-20 23:02:51	lewisrjc	in no small part we care about participation and effort
2013-02-20 23:03:04	User299	okay-dokey
2013-02-20 23:03:24	User299	that is encouraging
2013-02-20 23:03:39	lewisrjc	get as far as you can before you start nodding off and making stupid mistakes and then commit to a turn in
2013-02-20 23:03:57	User299	yeah i've got my syntax errors solved
2013-02-20 23:04:06	User299	let me send you one more draft
2013-02-20 23:04:08	lewisrjc	the second thing, and this is...complicated so realize I understand what I am saying, as a full time employed individual myself
2013-02-20 23:04:17	User299	okay, sorry
2013-02-20 23:04:18	User299	i understand
2013-02-20 23:04:23	User299	i appreciate your help
2013-02-20 23:04:27	User299	you've been very helpful
2013-02-20 23:04:28	lewisrjc	no not a problem
2013-02-20 23:04:32	lewisrjc	send me that draft
2013-02-20 23:04:42	lewisrjc	um, the second thing is
2013-02-20 23:05:00	User299	?
2013-02-20 23:05:09	lewisrjc	you need to talk to Bart. I can help, but quite frankly, he's better. Unfortunately he's going to be harder to get in touch with
2013-02-20 23:05:20	lewisrjc	I don't know if you are going to office hours
2013-02-20 23:05:34	lewisrjc	but for me that's always been both extraordinarily difficult
2013-02-20 23:05:41	lewisrjc	and very much worth it
2013-02-20 23:05:42	User299	yeah, that's a problem with working full time
2013-02-20 23:05:50	lewisrjc	I copy that
2013-02-20 23:06:00	User299	yeah when i was an undergrad i used to
2013-02-20 23:06:40	lewisrjc	he's a reedie too fyi
2013-02-20 23:06:50	User299	whoa
2013-02-20 23:06:51	User299	really?
2013-02-20 23:06:57	 *	lewisrjc may or may not have run your name through google
2013-02-20 23:06:58	User299	that's interesting
2013-02-20 23:06:59	lewisrjc	yup
2013-02-20 23:07:04	User299	oooo stalking!
2013-02-20 23:07:39	lewisrjc	I do it too most people to get their linkedin. Talking the way I talk to you to someone who is a professional DSP programmer could lose me a job
2013-02-20 23:08:09	lewisrjc	talking the way I do to a professional DSP programmer to you would be confusing, frustrating and pointless
2013-02-20 23:08:11	User299	totally understandable
2013-02-20 23:09:15	lewisrjc	oh wow
2013-02-20 23:09:18	User299	so i'm having the issue where "compwins" looses it's initial variable assignment towads the end
2013-02-20 23:09:49	User299	and i don't think i should have written
2013-02-20 23:10:19	User299	copguess = randrange(a), because a is a variable, not a list
2013-02-20 23:10:29	User299	however, i think i just learned that randrange(a)
2013-02-20 23:10:31	lewisrjc	uhyes
2013-02-20 23:10:40	User299	takes all variables 0 to a
2013-02-20 23:10:46	User299	i mean values
2013-02-20 23:10:46	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-20 23:10:49	lewisrjc	grar
2013-02-20 23:10:52	lewisrjc	so close
2013-02-20 23:10:59	+alevar	(not including a)
2013-02-20 23:11:29	+alevar	randrange(3) picks out of 0, 1, 2
2013-02-20 23:11:33	lewisrjc	uh, all right, compwins and playerwins need to be initialized in the exact same way as guesses(andthe exact same play
2013-02-20 23:11:34	User299	okay i'm changing a to a+1
2013-02-20 23:11:36	lewisrjc	place
2013-02-20 23:12:11	User299	but they are
2013-02-20 23:12:19	User299	lines 5 and 6
2013-02-20 23:13:05	User299	oooo compguess
2013-02-20 23:13:07	lewisrjc	not the version you sent me
2013-02-20 23:13:35	lewisrjc	um
2013-02-20 23:13:36	lewisrjc	oh
2013-02-20 23:13:40	lewisrjc	you aren't...
2013-02-20 23:13:42	lewisrjc	whoops
2013-02-20 23:13:49	lewisrjc	so you can't say "randrange"
2013-02-20 23:13:49	User299	does the version i sent you have the red #comments ??
2013-02-20 23:14:05	lewisrjc	everywhere you see randrange
2013-02-20 23:14:10	lewisrjc	replace with random.randrange
2013-02-20 23:14:15	User299	oooo
2013-02-20 23:14:18	lewisrjc	they re blue for me
2013-02-20 23:14:31	lewisrjc	just an fyi
2013-02-20 23:14:34	User299	okay then it must be the same
2013-02-20 23:14:51	lewisrjc	the random.randrange says "from the random import, use the randrange function"
2013-02-20 23:14:57	User299	ooookay
2013-02-20 23:15:20	lewisrjc	so yes initialize compwins and playerwins the same way as guesses
2013-02-20 23:15:40	User299	ooo i see what you're saying now
2013-02-20 23:15:45	User299	like compwins = []
2013-02-20 23:15:56	lewisrjc	and the print("round" + a) should be print("round",a)
2013-02-20 23:15:56	lewisrjc	ys
2013-02-20 23:16:03	lewisrjc	yes exactly
2013-02-20 23:16:11	lewisrjc	again, the print thing I think is just syntax
2013-02-20 23:16:25	lewisrjc	as is the randrange, the compwins is a bit of a minor logic error
2013-02-20 23:18:07	User299	compwins is just a variable to hold the number of times the computer wins
2013-02-20 23:18:09	User299	hm
2013-02-20 23:18:26	lewisrjc	regardless you are passing it to a function before it is initialized
2013-02-20 23:18:39	lewisrjc	if it shouldn't be a list then you sholdn't send it to list
2013-02-20 23:18:41	lewisrjc	all right
2013-02-20 23:18:48	lewisrjc	for realsies I am going to sleep
2013-02-20 23:18:53	User299	cool
2013-02-20 23:18:54	User299	thanks
2013-02-20 23:18:56	lewisrjc	don't forget about that + sign
2013-02-20 23:18:56	User299	byyee
2013-02-20 23:19:04	lewisrjc	and the random.randrange
2013-02-20 23:19:16	User299	oookay
2013-02-20 23:20:01	lewisrjc	the random.randrange error is "name randrange not defined" that means you said "randrange" instead of "random.randrange" (I have spent...DAYS debugging this kind of error, so I will harp on it a bit)
2013-02-20 23:20:07	lewisrjc	peace
2013-02-20 23:20:10	lewisrjc	and joy
2013-02-20 23:21:14	User299	also funny story
2013-02-20 23:21:26	User299	a trimet worker got worker's comp when she sat on a toilet and crushed it
2013-02-20 23:21:29	User299	sad story
2013-02-20 23:21:31	User299	but true
2013-02-20 23:21:48	User299	that's my nugget of truth for the night

2013-02-21 15:58:57	User17585	My while loop in python isn't working correctly, and I'm not exactly sure why. It's not breaking out of the loop even though the condition is met.
2013-02-21 16:03:51	haus	if the condition is met, the loop continues
2013-02-21 16:04:10	haus	how is the for loop written?
2013-02-21 16:08:45	User17585	This is the while loop: http://pastie.org/private/jiovk0w9xzgegooqke7irg
2013-02-21 16:09:05	User17585	When I enter H or T, it doesn't break out of the loop.
2013-02-21 16:11:51	haus	oh
2013-02-21 16:12:02	haus	i don't think the or is doing what you think
2013-02-21 16:13:04	haus	have you tried using python's REPL?
2013-02-21 16:13:25	haus	see what happens when you do...
2013-02-21 16:13:31	haus	if 'H':
2013-02-21 16:13:38	haus	  print("TRUE")
2013-02-21 16:20:25	User17585	It does say "TRUE" after that
2013-02-21 16:32:36	haus	right
2013-02-21 16:33:29	haus	so when you say "while a != 'T' or 'H':"
2013-02-21 16:34:09	haus	that breaks down to: loop again if (a != 'T') or if 'H'
2013-02-21 16:34:26	haus	'H' always evaluates to true, so the or is always true, so it always loops
2013-02-21 16:38:05	User17585	Ahh I see. Thanks.
2013-02-21 16:39:06	User17585	What's an alternative to the "or" that you would recommend?
2013-02-21 16:41:45	Wren	you need to say if a != 'T' and a != 'H'
2013-02-21 16:41:48	Wren	or
2013-02-21 16:42:10	Wren	!(a == 'T' or a == 'H')
2013-02-21 16:42:22	Wren	Both statements are logically equivilant
2013-02-21 16:42:28	Wren	*equivalent
2013-02-21 16:45:04	User17585	That works! Thanks a lot!
2013-02-21 16:45:19	Wren	no problem
2013-02-21 16:45:23	User17585	I was over thinking it I guess!
2013-02-21 16:55:28	lewisrjc	oh yeah, logic is commutative in most programming languages
2013-02-21 16:55:40	lewisrjc	neither is the casting operator for those who know what that means

2013-02-21 18:34:58	User678	hello! i have a 162 question
2013-02-21 18:40:04	Wren	This is the place to ask.
2013-02-21 18:42:03	User678	i am getting a seg fault if the user tries to open a file that doesnt exist
2013-02-21 18:42:54	User678	i have an if statement if it doesn't load, but i'm not getting the written output, just a seg fault
2013-02-21 18:49:02	User678	if [!load_in[group, num_booths]]     with parens instead of square
2013-02-21 19:08:42	Wren	User678: I'm not sure how to solve that particular problem off the top of my head, but stick around and someone will likely answer you
2013-02-21 19:09:42	@krinkle	User678: is load_in your ifstream variable?
2013-02-21 19:09:46	User678	okay thanks
2013-02-21 19:10:00	User678	load_in is my array for ifstream
2013-02-21 19:10:18	@krinkle	why do you have an array for ifstream?
2013-02-21 19:11:45	User678	sorry i meant function
2013-02-21 19:12:35	@krinkle	oh, okay
2013-02-21 19:13:09	@krinkle	so if load_in is doing all the reading, then your check for whether the file was opened correctly should happen inside your load_in function before you start reading
2013-02-21 19:13:46	@krinkle	This page has some guidelines on how to do that: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
2013-02-21 19:17:45	User678	okay thanks i'll check it out
2013-02-21 19:18:19	@krinkle	Does that help? I'm not sure if I interpreted your problem correctly
2013-02-21 19:19:08	User678	i will have to read the site later because now i'm in another class, but i'll see if i can find something that applies.
2013-02-21 19:20:15	@krinkle	okay -- the general idea is to check that your open() worked correctly by checking whether the ifstream is_open() returns true or just by checking whether your ifstream variable is set
2013-02-21 19:21:59	User678	okay
2013-02-21 19:22:27	User678	i'm surprised that it's not working, because it came from one of the prof's codes
2013-02-21 19:22:53	User678	the format of the statement
2013-02-21 19:24:49	@krinkle	maybe if I saw more of you code I could help more
2013-02-21 19:25:01	@krinkle	but then again it might be better to wait till you're out of class :)
2013-02-21 19:25:37	User678	if you know which part would be helpful to see, i can send it
2013-02-21 19:26:22	@krinkle	whatever part of your code is opening, reading, and closing the file
2013-02-21 19:26:48	User678	okay, i can email it in a few minutes
2013-02-21 19:53:58	User678	it turns out class is more interactive than usual. i'll just have to get online later and see if anyone is on. thanks for your help!
2013-02-21 20:03:46	User678	actually i have a new question
2013-02-21 20:04:58	User678	i'm trying to get the input from the user and put it in my file, but i'd like to type in some extra things, but then when i write my fileout, it has to match up, and my filein function isn't letting me type in stuff
2013-02-21 20:05:07	User678	i'm assuming i'm doing it wrong
2013-02-21 20:05:47	User678	like if the user puts in their vendor name, i want the file to say "vendor: blah blah" so that it's more readable when someone opens the file
2013-02-21 20:18:28	@krinkle	if you write "vendor: blah blah" to the file then it will be slightly more complicated to read back in
2013-02-21 20:19:03	@krinkle	but if you want to do that you can just do `fileout << "vendor: " << userdatavariable;
2013-02-21 20:19:08	@krinkle	`
2013-02-21 20:20:19	User678	yeah thats what i have for the fileout
2013-02-21 20:20:29	User678	but i'm running into problems on filein
2013-02-21 20:20:48	User678	i tried infile >> "blah" but it didn't like that
2013-02-21 20:21:02	User678	and i tried adding fileout in the same function
2013-02-21 20:21:30	@krinkle	when you read in a file it reads every character
2013-02-21 20:21:47	@krinkle	if you have extra characters in there that you don't want like "vendor: " you have to discard them
2013-02-21 20:22:11	@krinkle	but the file is not something that should ever need to be read
2013-02-21 20:22:35	@krinkle	it would save some headache to not add the extra characters
2013-02-21 20:23:05	@krinkle	*need to be read by humans
2013-02-21 20:24:22	User678	okay haha then i'll just take it out

2013-02-27 14:36:09	zaalatta	'Ello people. Quick question, does the data structure graph one way? I.e., does each vertex have to have a flag for if it was visited or not?
2013-02-27 14:36:27	zaalatta	*is the data structure graph one way
2013-02-27 14:39:28	pfaffle	zaalatta: are you trying to perform a traversal?
2013-02-27 14:42:27	zaalatta	pfaffle: yep, so I know that when you're traversing a graph, there's usually a flag that's checked once you've already been to a vertex and I'm wondering if that's an integral part of the graph
2013-02-27 14:42:51	 *	zaalatta is rusty on her data structures..
2013-02-27 14:43:14	pfaffle	hrm.
2013-02-27 14:43:27	pfaffle	I've never had to do a traversal on a graph before
2013-02-27 14:43:46	pfaffle	it seems weird to me to have it be a property of a vertex though.
2013-02-27 14:44:54	zaalatta	Right well you'd wanna know if you've already been to that vertex, right?
2013-02-27 14:45:05	zaalatta	Idk, that's how I implemented it last quarter
2013-02-27 14:45:09	pfaffle	Well, it doesn't strike me as something the data structure should have to keep track of - if the client program's search has visited a vertex or not
2013-02-27 14:45:37	pfaffle	but, I'm not sure how else you would viably do it.
2013-02-27 14:45:38	whopper	I think it depends on the application. If you're making a graph for say, course prerequisites, you would 't really care if you've been to a vertex - you'd just traverse the LLL or however you implemented it once
2013-02-27 14:46:20	whopper	if you were keeping track of where someone was on the graph, then I guess you'd want to know which have been visited
2013-02-27 14:46:35	pfaffle	I think it really depends on how you implement it
2013-02-27 14:47:18	pfaffle	if you have a LLL of vertices where each one has an array of adjacent nodes, or something, then you could just iterate through the LLL
2013-02-27 14:48:04	zaalatta	Oh, I think we implemented it in the opposite way - an array of vertices each with an LLL of adjacent nodes
2013-02-27 14:48:08	pfaffle	or, each node could have a unique id, and you could just check and remember the id of each node you visit to see if you've been there before
2013-02-27 14:49:11	zaalatta	I guess my question then is do you have to keep track of which vertices have been visited or is it implementation-dependent?
2013-02-27 14:50:12	zaalatta	Based on what you've said, I'd assume it's implementation dependent but I want to be sure
2013-02-27 14:51:22	whopper	yeah, you couls certainu make a graph without keeping track and it'd be just fine, ao implementation dependent
2013-02-27 14:51:27	whopper	certainly*
2013-02-27 14:51:34	whopper	so*
2013-02-27 14:51:45	whopper	could* -_-
2013-02-27 14:51:48	pfaffle	lol
2013-02-27 14:52:28	zaalatta	Hehe, are you on irc through your phone, whopper?
2013-02-27 14:52:45	whopper	>_> yes <_<
2013-02-27 14:53:10	zaalatta	Ah, it makes sense - no autocorrect on those things.. :/
2013-02-27 14:53:24	whopper	heh
2013-02-27 14:53:27	zaalatta	But thanks guys, stuffs be clear now! :)
2013-02-27 14:53:37	zaalatta	pfaffle++ whopper++ :)
2013-02-27 14:53:57	whopper	woo! Hopefully we're not utterly wrong :P
2013-02-27 14:54:17	zaalatta	Heh, I'll just tell Karla it was all your guys' fault!
2013-02-27 14:54:25	whopper	lol
2013-02-27 14:54:29	pfaffle	lol
2013-02-27 14:54:34	pfaffle	honestly, she won't care
2013-02-27 14:55:08	pfaffle	if you discuss that you considered the implications of making 'visited' a property of the vertices in a graph, you'll get major bonus points.
2013-02-27 14:55:14	pfaffle	that's all she cares about
2013-02-27 14:55:21	pfaffle	that you consider these things in an OOP way
2013-02-27 14:55:32	zaalatta	Aha! I can put that in my design write-up!
2013-02-27 14:55:37	pfaffle	and make judgment calls based on your considerations
2013-02-27 14:55:37	zaalatta	pfaffle++ :D
2013-02-27 14:55:46	pfaffle	yep!
2013-02-27 14:56:02	 *	pfaffle meant to append ...to your write up to that sentence.

2013-02-28 15:42:39	User802	I am haveing an issue with my homework assignment. can i post the code somewhere and have someone look over it?
2013-02-28 15:43:32	User802	My structs are returning garbage. and Im not sure how to prevent them from doing so.
2013-02-28 15:46:00	+lpl	You can post your code to pastebin or any other similar service. However from your description of the problem, my guess would be that you have pointers in your struct that you are not initializing to null.
2013-02-28 15:48:43	User802	That sounds correct. Would i initialize them to zero in the prototype or in main?
2013-02-28 15:48:50	User802	maybe i can do it without posting the code
2013-02-28 15:49:43	User802	I also have NO idea what pastebin is.
2013-02-28 15:50:26	+lpl	the link for pastebin is in the message that comes up when you connect to this channel, its a service where you can paste code in and share a public link to it
2013-02-28 15:51:11	+lpl	As to the code, you would initialize them to null in main/wherever you create them
2013-02-28 15:55:18	User802	http://pastebin.com/1ZYU6kLv
2013-02-28 15:55:31	User802	There is the link to my code. Thanks so much for looking at it.
2013-02-28 15:56:11	User802	Structs hurt my head a little so im not sure how I would go about initializing them to null
2013-02-28 15:59:32	+lpl	Basically it would just be a for loop that loops through your array of booths and sets all the pointer elements to nul
2013-02-28 15:59:36	+lpl	*null
2013-02-28 16:01:49	User802	ok I think i can do that. one last question. As a part of my assignment I need to search for a record in an external file. besides loading and reading from the file how would i do that? Sting compare?
2013-02-28 16:02:42	+lpl	Personally I would handle that by reading the entire file into my array of structs and do the search with a for loop and a string compare from there
2013-02-28 16:04:00	User802	Great thanks!
2013-02-28 16:04:36	+lpl	No problem

2013-03-05 14:41:31	User770	i think my insert is wrong

2013-03-07 12:50:56	User875	i have a question about the max function in python
2013-03-07 12:50:58	User875	i'm in CS161
2013-03-07 12:51:03	User875	our proficiency exam is tonight
2013-03-07 12:51:30	User875	this is the line that won't work in my code:
2013-03-07 12:51:32	User875	print(max(temps))
2013-03-07 12:51:42	User875	excuse me
2013-03-07 12:51:48	User875	print(max(temps)):
2013-03-07 12:51:53	User875	where temps is the name of my list
2013-03-07 12:52:04	User875	it should print, but it doesn't do anything!
2013-03-07 12:54:05	Wren	Why do you have a colon at the end?
2013-03-07 12:55:01	User875	because it didn't work without one
2013-03-07 12:55:04	User875	but it also doesn't work with it
2013-03-07 12:55:08	User875	i'm just trying to make it work
2013-03-07 12:55:32	Wren	Colons should only appear at the start of a block, which you are doing there.
2013-03-07 12:55:49	Wren	Try `print max(temps)`
2013-03-07 12:55:57	kini	<User875> i'm just trying to make it work
2013-03-07 12:55:57	kini	this is a really bad idea
2013-03-07 12:56:01	User875	okay that worked
2013-03-07 12:56:08	User875	thank you
2013-03-07 12:56:09	kini	never just sprinkle your code with random things in the hopes that it will "work"
2013-03-07 12:56:13	User875	okay
2013-03-07 12:56:22	Wren	User875: What version of python are you using?
2013-03-07 12:56:23	kini	even if it appears to start working, it's almost never "working" in the way that you actually wanted it to
2013-03-07 12:56:41	User875	python 3.3
2013-03-07 12:57:28	Wren	Weird, that parenthetical version should work.
2013-03-07 12:57:32	Wren	It works for me.
2013-03-07 12:57:52	Wren	On 3.2, but still, that's the way they want it done now.
2013-03-07 12:57:55	User875	it works for me too now
2013-03-07 12:58:07	User875	i had too many lines empty between that and the rest of the code
2013-03-07 12:58:12	User875	okay, another question?
2013-03-07 12:58:16	Wren	Actually they got rid of the version without parenthesis.
2013-03-07 12:58:16	User875	what does this error mean?
2013-03-07 12:58:25	Wren	Are you sure you are running python 3.3?
2013-03-07 12:58:25	User875	TypeError: must use keyword argument for key function
2013-03-07 12:58:41	kini	<User875> i had too many lines empty between that and the rest of the code
2013-03-07 12:58:45	Wren	User875: run `python -V` from the command line
2013-03-07 12:58:47	User875	yes, i just opened up IDLE and clicked "about IDLE"
2013-03-07 12:58:48	kini	more likely, you had a line with some spaces in it
2013-03-07 12:59:02	User875	ooooo
2013-03-07 12:59:07	kini	spaces change the indentation level
2013-03-07 12:59:19	kini	maybe you were getting an "unexpected indentation" error or something like that
2013-03-07 12:59:34	kini	another tip: whenever you have an error, don't just think "oh I have an error", read the actual error message
2013-03-07 12:59:42	kini	there's a reason it's there, and it should help you to find the problem
2013-03-07 13:02:55	User875	okay what is the availability of the tutors today?
2013-03-07 13:02:57	User875	can i come in?
2013-03-07 13:05:30	@krinkle	User875: the tutors are open till 6 today
2013-03-07 13:06:12	User875	cool cool
2013-03-07 13:06:38	User875	okay, so i found the lenth of the a list, and then returned the last element in the list because i know how long it is
2013-03-07 13:06:54	User875	how do i print the second to last element in the list?
2013-03-07 13:10:32	User875	okay never mind i figured it out
2013-03-07 13:20:22	User875	i guess i don't get how to use rsplit
2013-03-07 13:20:34	User875	i can't just tack it onto anything

2013-03-07 14:19:14	Wren	he's gone

2013-03-07 14:33:29	+rueckerc	really??
2013-03-07 14:33:31	+rueckerc	thats fantastic
2013-03-07 14:56:59	kini	yup
2013-03-07 14:57:13	kini	indexing in python is one of the nice things about the language
2013-03-07 14:57:27	kini	for example you can reverse a list with foo[::-1]

2013-03-07 16:01:52	User599	post contains the members that would describe a posting
2013-03-07 16:03:37	User599	list contains an array of postings and search functions

2013-03-07 16:06:16	Slim	what language is this?
2013-03-07 16:06:24	User599	the array of postings is declared in the list class, so how do i access member arrays declared in post class?
2013-03-07 16:06:26	User599	c++
2013-03-07 16:10:30	User599	in other words how does class B access arrays declared in class A?
2013-03-07 16:18:52	Slim	well if you're trying to access the post class from inside of a function in the list class, I'm sure you can access by doing post[index].member
2013-03-07 16:19:08	Slim	I think. if there is an array of posts

2013-03-11 14:37:10	knick	if I’m writing a .cpp file for a class whose associated .h file has both public and private functions,  does the cpp file need to be divided into public and private sections as well?
2013-03-11 14:37:31	knick	or will the compiler recognize the function definitions by name/argument?
2013-03-11 14:37:40	@krinkle	the compiler will know

2013-03-11 21:12:51	User590	i'm having an issue with my 162 program
2013-03-11 21:13:00	User590	with my dynamic arrays
2013-03-11 21:45:47	@krinkle	User590: do you still need help? What are you having trouble with?
2013-03-11 21:47:45	User590	yeah, if its possible.
2013-03-11 21:48:22	User590	i have dynamic arrays in one function of a class, then i try to cout those arrays in another function of the same class, but it's giving me a seg fault.
2013-03-11 21:48:58	User590	if my dynamic arrays are called title and desc, i'm just trying to print out those.
2013-03-11 21:49:21	User590	with cout << title << desc;
2013-03-11 21:49:32	User590	is that incorrect since it's from one function to another?
2013-03-11 21:55:43	@krinkle	could I see a snippet of your code? how are your arrays being passed into / returning out of the functions?
2013-03-11 21:55:59	@krinkle	dynamically allocating memory inside a function can be kind of tricky
2013-03-11 21:58:14	@krinkle	or are the arrays members of the class?
2013-03-11 22:00:13	User590	sure, i'll just email it if that sounds good
2013-03-11 22:00:23	@krinkle	sure, tutors@cs.pdx.edu
2013-03-11 22:00:23	User590	they are members of the class
2013-03-11 22:02:46	User590	okay i just sent it
2013-03-11 22:03:03	User590	i reuse title and desc for the other parts of the listings too
2013-03-11 22:03:37	User590	and i delete the arrays at the beginning of each part like you see, so i don't have memory leak
2013-03-11 22:05:18	@krinkle	so if you have title and desc as members of your class, you don't want to redeclare them as part of your Create_Posting function or you will override your member variables
2013-03-11 22:05:57	@krinkle	you want title and desc to persist after Create_Posting finishes, but declaring them as local variables will only let them be visible within that function
2013-03-11 22:06:16	User590	ohhh
2013-03-11 22:06:50	User590	so then is there a way to fix memory leak?
2013-03-11 22:07:38	@krinkle	to fix memory leaks you will want to make sure you delete [] title and desc in your Posting destructor
2013-03-11 22:07:49	User590	the reason i did that, is if the user doesn't like what they've entered as a posting, i just let them start the whole post over
2013-03-11 22:07:49	@krinkle	you don't need to take care of it within Create_Posting
2013-03-11 22:08:04	@krinkle	ah
2013-03-11 22:08:32	@krinkle	you might want ot say if(title) then delete title, but then you still don't need to redeclare title or desc
2013-03-11 22:09:45	User590	so that would go at the top of my function? so it only deletes if there's already info stored in it?
2013-03-11 22:10:04	@krinkle	yeah
2013-03-11 22:10:09	User590	okay i'll try it!
2013-03-11 22:10:11	User590	thanks!
2013-03-11 22:10:40	@krinkle	but then again, it's probably better to just delete your Posting instance than to try to overwrite the stuff you already put there
2013-03-11 22:10:55	@krinkle	but yeah, that should work
2013-03-11 22:11:03	User590	ok i'll give it a whirl
2013-03-11 22:11:15	@krinkle	cool
2013-03-11 22:12:40	User590	haha it's better, but i still get a seg fault
2013-03-11 22:12:52	User590	it prints out the info now, which it didn't before
2013-03-11 22:12:59	User590	shoot!
2013-03-11 22:14:41	@krinkle	hmm, if it prints out correctly then the segfault is probably not in the code I'm seeing
2013-03-11 22:14:51	User590	oh you're probably right
2013-03-11 22:14:51	@krinkle	because that means that the create and the display worked as expected
2013-03-11 22:14:59	User590	this is what it gave:
2013-03-11 22:15:30	User590	job posting:
2013-03-11 22:15:35	User590	title:blahblah
2013-03-11 22:15:39	User590	description:blahblah
2013-03-11 22:15:46	User590	compensation:blah
2013-03-11 22:15:50	User590	 job posting:
2013-03-11 22:15:54	User590	  seg fault
2013-03-11 22:16:13	@krinkle	ah, so it looks like you're trying to print two job postings when you only input one
2013-03-11 22:16:15	User590	ohhhh yeah i think it's a problem in my next function!
2013-03-11 22:16:30	User590	because then theres another function later that prints out all of the jobs
2013-03-11 22:16:35	User590	i should check that out
2013-03-11 22:16:43	User590	yeah, unless its doing what you said
2013-03-11 22:17:51	@krinkle	or what you said :)
2013-03-11 22:18:20	User590	i don't know why it would try another, it's just in an if statement. so then it should move along i would think!
2013-03-11 22:18:30	User590	can i send you the next function? its short
2013-03-11 22:24:03	@krinkle	sure
2013-03-11 22:24:22	@krinkle	though it sounds like you worked it out for the most part
2013-03-11 22:25:24	User590	haha what?? i haven't worked out anything!
2013-03-11 22:25:29	User590	i'm totally lost
2013-03-11 22:25:45	User590	it's a wonder i've even made it this far
2013-03-11 22:25:46	@krinkle	well you said you thought there was something going on in your next function
2013-03-11 22:25:52	@krinkle	so that sounds likely
2013-03-11 22:25:58	User590	oh yeah but i don't know what it would be
2013-03-11 22:26:04	User590	that's where my knowledge ends
2013-03-11 22:29:52	@krinkle	hmm, it's hard to say without the full context
2013-03-11 22:30:29	@krinkle	my guess is that maybe the_list[count] isn't initialized before you try to display it
2013-03-11 22:30:58	@krinkle	also Add doesn't seem to adding the a_post to the list anywhere
2013-03-11 22:31:06	@krinkle	it only displays it
2013-03-11 22:31:57	User590	oh yeah, i thought that since it incremented through the array the_list, it would store the info in that spot
2013-03-11 22:32:23	@krinkle	your count is incrementing, but I don't see where you're actually storing the data in the list
2013-03-11 22:32:34	User590	oh shoot
2013-03-11 22:32:52	@krinkle	actually I would just replace the_list[count].display with the_list[count].create and that should do it
2013-03-11 22:33:10	User590	oh yeah... that's what the tutor said to do, then i think i changed it later
2013-03-11 22:33:12	User590	dummy
2013-03-11 22:33:15	@krinkle	:)
2013-03-11 22:34:40	User590	i guess i am having a hard time understanding the difference. since create_posting holds the data, and display_posting just outputs the same data, i guess i would think that the data is still held in display_posting
2013-03-11 22:34:46	User590	im' assuming that's wrong
2013-03-11 22:35:01	User590	since it's only displaying
2013-03-11 22:35:17	@krinkle	well the data you gathered from create_posting is stuck in a_post, but the thing you're trying to display is the_list[count] which is a completely different variable
2013-03-11 22:36:27	User590	okay
2013-03-11 22:36:31	User590	i'll try this again
2013-03-11 22:37:01	@krinkle	okay :)
2013-03-11 22:37:18	@krinkle	I need to get going, but if you get stuck you can try back here or email the tutors
2013-03-11 22:38:00	User590	okay thanks for your help

2013-03-17 12:22:48	User028	i'm wondering if you can explain to me why a piece of code works
2013-03-17 12:22:54	User028	I'm studying for the CS161 final
2013-03-17 12:23:11	bajr	I can give it a shot
2013-03-17 12:23:16	User028	and one of the problems on the sample final exam works a certain way, but i don't know why
2013-03-17 12:23:22	User028	cool one sec
2013-03-17 12:23:47	User028	http://pastebin.com/nyXxVAqq
2013-03-17 12:23:53	User028	so my question is:
2013-03-17 12:24:20	User028	what is tList? It is never defined, and the program spits out something that looks a lot like aList
2013-03-17 12:25:28	bajr	ah, tList is defined, but in a sneaky way
2013-03-17 12:25:38	User028	ok?
2013-03-17 12:25:46	bajr	def organizeList (tList):
2013-03-17 12:26:00	bajr	that's where it's 'defined' within the scope of the organizeList function
2013-03-17 12:26:09	User028	but what values does it hold?
2013-03-17 12:26:14	User028	what is its relationship to aList?
2013-03-17 12:26:18	bajr	depends what you give it
2013-03-17 12:26:32	User028	ooooooooooo
2013-03-17 12:26:42	bajr	so when you call organizeList, it accepts a variable and names it tList
2013-03-17 12:27:01	User028	okay got it!
2013-03-17 12:27:03	User028	thanks!
2013-03-17 12:27:03	bajr	in this case, it is being given aList, but for the purposes of the function it is called tList
2013-03-17 12:27:04	User028	:)

2013-03-17 12:36:22	User028	okay i have another question
2013-03-17 12:36:47	User028	i'm trying to make a program load a text file on start-up
2013-03-17 12:42:00	User028	okay wait a different question
2013-03-17 12:42:03	User028	are u there?
2013-03-17 12:48:30	bajr	sorry, i'm back
2013-03-17 12:48:32	bajr	what's up?
2013-03-17 12:48:34	User028	cool
2013-03-17 12:48:54	User028	for some reason ( and i think it's an indentation thing, but i've tried literally every way to indent)
2013-03-17 12:49:16	User028	my program is not asking the user to input a choice (a,m,p, etc.)
2013-03-17 12:49:28	User028	it jumps right to the "do you want to continue" function
2013-03-17 12:49:29	User028	http://pastebin.com/UpUrH6w0
2013-03-17 12:50:29	User028	line 42 is not printing
2013-03-17 12:50:33	User028	and that's not good
2013-03-17 12:50:36	User028	ch = input("Welcome to the Payroll System. What would you like to do? Select a choice. ")
2013-03-17 12:51:21	bajr	that's because it's never being called from the main function
2013-03-17 12:53:00	User028	hmm
2013-03-17 12:53:23	User028	so to call a function inside of a program, i can say something like "return Responses(parameter) ??
2013-03-17 12:54:33	User028	oh man i had repeated my main function twice inside itself
2013-03-17 12:54:36	User028	yikes
2013-03-17 12:57:01	User028	yeah and i had some serious indentation issues
2013-03-17 12:57:02	User028	that are now fixed
2013-03-17 12:57:32	bajr	yeah, for Responses to be called, you have to call it from wherever the main function is. It's up to you whether you want to return anything from it (though I'd suggest being careful about putting a return in the middle of your main)
2013-03-17 12:57:45	User028	why?
2013-03-17 12:57:56	User028	what can be the downside of having a return in the middle of my main
2013-03-17 12:58:27	bajr	it'll likely end your program before you intend to
2013-03-17 13:00:34	User028	oh man now absolutely nothing is working
2013-03-17 13:30:10	stormcrow	User028: Are you still there? maybe I can help a bit
2013-03-17 13:33:27	User028	hi,
2013-03-17 13:33:29	User028	yeah i'm here
2013-03-17 13:34:10	stormcrow	cool. Are you still having trouble with the assignment?
2013-03-17 13:34:26	User028	yes lots of trouble
2013-03-17 13:34:33	User028	it's cool though i'm enjoying it oddly
2013-03-17 13:34:34	User028	http://pastebin.com/TF6BAQiA
2013-03-17 13:34:50	stormcrow	alright, let me take a look
2013-03-17 13:35:13	User028	thanks
2013-03-17 13:35:38	stormcrow	What happens when you try to run the program?
2013-03-17 13:35:47	User028	so the problem is that my function printMenu() and responses() does not print out
2013-03-17 13:35:56	User028	i'm not calling them in the right place or something
2013-03-17 13:36:06	User028	when i run it, nothing prints at all
2013-03-17 13:36:13	User028	it used to only print the menu
2013-03-17 13:36:19	stormcrow	OK, can you tell if it does much of anything at all?
2013-03-17 13:37:10	User028	it should print out the menu choices and then request a choice from the user
2013-03-17 13:37:15	User028	but it doesn't print out anything anymore
2013-03-17 13:37:35	User028	it opens an exterior file
2013-03-17 13:37:40	User028	that's all that's happening now
2013-03-17 13:38:02	stormcrow	alright, could you add the line "main()" at the end of your code (unidented, without quotes) and tell me what happens?
2013-03-17 13:38:10	stormcrow	*unindented
2013-03-17 13:38:17	User028	okay i'll try now
2013-03-17 13:38:38	User028	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 83, in <module>     main()   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 69, in main     employeeList = file.readlines("w") UnboundLocalError: local variable 'file' referenced before assignment >>>
2013-03-17 13:38:51	stormcrow	well, at least that's soemthing different
2013-03-17 13:38:57	User028	yeah
2013-03-17 13:39:08	User028	oh it's cuz i don't have any global variables
2013-03-17 13:39:18	User028	so i need to define "file" inside of main()??
2013-03-17 13:39:21	User028	i'll try that
2013-03-17 13:41:06	stormcrow	hmm, this, I think, is where things start getting interesting
2013-03-17 13:41:17	User028	yeah
2013-03-17 13:41:21	User028	it's not working
2013-03-17 13:41:24	User028	lol
2013-03-17 13:41:31	User028	btw i like the name stormcrow that's cool
2013-03-17 13:41:42	stormcrow	ner the beginning of the code, you have file defined, but that doesn't carry over to the function
2013-03-17 13:42:03	stormcrow	thanks! It's something I pulled from Lord of the Rings
2013-03-17 13:42:18	User028	okay, so this is my biggest question - should everything i've written previous to main() be inside of main() in order to be usefull ??
2013-03-17 13:42:28	User028	yay love LOTR
2013-03-17 13:42:50	stormcrow	you actually don't really need to define a main(), technically
2013-03-17 13:43:11	User028	yeah but i have to for the HW requirement
2013-03-17 13:43:13	stormcrow	Python deosn't call main() automatically like C does
2013-03-17 13:43:17	stormcrow	oh, you do?
2013-03-17 13:43:20	User028	yup
2013-03-17 13:43:20	stormcrow	hrm
2013-03-17 13:44:02	stormcrow	and I assume you can't really touch anything above that comment on line 66?
2013-03-17 13:44:04	User028	it says 'it needs to have one function called main() with no parameters. this function is the starting point to run your program. the program shoudl call main() when run from shell.
2013-03-17 13:44:13	User028	it should NOT call main if imported from another file.
2013-03-17 13:44:45	User028	i what does she mean by "shell"?
2013-03-17 13:44:48	User028	donna wrote this HW
2013-03-17 13:45:00	User028	i think shell means IDLE?
2013-03-17 13:45:54	stormcrow	yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what she means
2013-03-17 13:45:58	stormcrow	let's see...
2013-03-17 13:47:09	User028	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 84, in <module>     main()   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 70, in main     employeeList = file.readlines("w") TypeError: integer argument expected, got 'str'
2013-03-17 13:49:18	stormcrow	for that error that just came up, it's because file.readlines() can't actually take a string
2013-03-17 13:49:43	stormcrow	what sort of thing are you trying to do?
2013-03-17 13:50:20	User028	i want to print out a list of menu options and then prompt the user for his selection of one of these items
2013-03-17 13:50:28	User028	i also want to upload a .txt file to the program
2013-03-17 13:50:39	User028	and then i have a seperate .txt file
2013-03-17 13:50:49	User028	and depending upon the choice of the user
2013-03-17 13:51:07	User028	i will either read from, add to, odify, or delete items uploaded from that .txt file
2013-03-17 13:51:11	User028	does that make sense?
2013-03-17 13:52:09	User028	*add to, modify, or delete, or print items (which are uploaded as a list and then converted to a dictionary) from a .txt file
2013-03-17 13:52:32	User028	it's a payroll system
2013-03-17 13:52:54	stormcrow	I think so. You want to print out the menu, read in a text file, then have another text file that you can modify depending on what the user wants, right
2013-03-17 13:52:57	stormcrow	?
2013-03-17 13:54:21	User028	no, only one text file
2013-03-17 13:55:03	User028	at the very end of my program, i will delete everything on the .txt file, and replace it when the dictionary that the program creates
2013-03-17 13:55:21	User028	so i have two python program files, and a text file with a list of employee payroll info
2013-03-17 13:55:59	User028	and in the first program file, i have the menu option, response, and file uploading programs, the main program that runs all of those
2013-03-17 13:56:26	User028	and in the second program file, i have the four functions that run each of the menu choice functions (add, delete, modify, and print)
2013-03-17 13:56:52	stormcrow	alright, I think I get it now
2013-03-17 13:56:57	User028	coool
2013-03-17 13:57:39	stormcrow	you're not supposed to change anything above that comment on line 66, right?
2013-03-17 13:59:03	User028	right
2013-03-17 13:59:25	User028	it's loosely based off of a demo program Donna wrote
2013-03-17 13:59:38	stormcrow	ok, first, remove the "w" from the file.readlines("w") so it's just file.readlines()
2013-03-17 14:00:23	stormcrow	then run it again and see what it gives you
2013-03-17 14:02:07	User028	it worked
2013-03-17 14:02:08	User028	a - add a new employee   d - delete an employee   m - modify an employee   p - print all employees Welcome to the Payroll System. What would you like to do? Select a choice. aTraceback (most recent call last):   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 84, in <module>     main()   File "/Users/ericaboule/Desktop/CS161/Main_BOULAY.py", line 70, in main     employeeList = file.readlines("w") TypeError: integer argument expected, got 'str'
2013-03-17 14:02:13	User028	so it printed the menu
2013-03-17 14:02:42	User028	and then i still have the issue where it doesn't like that the things in the .txt file is a series of strings
2013-03-17 14:03:04	User028	and it doesn't like that i call main() in that way at the very end
2013-03-17 14:04:04	stormcrow	actually, it looks like it's already reading in the employee info at the beginning of the progra,
2013-03-17 14:04:04	User028	this is what is confusing to me
2013-03-17 14:04:23	User028	sometimes i have to call functions, like that "main()" and sometimes I can make them run just by defining them
2013-03-17 14:04:30	User028	what's up with that?
2013-03-17 14:05:07	stormcrow	In general, you need to call a function that you're defined with the "def function_name()"
2013-03-17 14:05:37	stormcrow	if it's not in a function definition, it'll just go down and execute that line
2013-03-17 14:06:08	User028	what?
2013-03-17 14:06:17	stormcrow	so when I told you to put main() at the end, it was because main() was never actually being called. but by putting it there we made sure python would see that it was something that had to be done
2013-03-17 14:06:20	User028	what do you mean by 'execute that line"?
2013-03-17 14:06:33	stormcrow	do what that line of code says
2013-03-17 14:06:41	User028	okay yeah
2013-03-17 14:07:19	stormcrow	Does all that make sense?
2013-03-17 14:07:59	User028	yes, but sometimes i can just type "print(abc)" and it will print "abc"
2013-03-17 14:08:08	User028	i don't have to call that short function
2013-03-17 14:08:15	User028	it just executes by itself without being called
2013-03-17 14:08:50	stormcrow	yes, some functions are built in
2013-03-17 14:09:01	stormcrow	you don't need to write them or import them from anywhere
2013-03-17 14:09:06	User028	oooo i'm special
2013-03-17 14:09:07	User028	got it
2013-03-17 14:09:09	User028	sorry!!
2013-03-17 14:09:16	stormcrow	no worries
2013-03-17 14:09:24	User028	okay, so why would calling a function cause an error?
2013-03-17 14:09:54	stormcrow	In this case, it's because you're passing it a string when it's expecting an integer, or nothing at all
2013-03-17 14:11:51	stormcrow	it doesn't know what to do about that, so it tells you that something's wrong by printing that error and stops
2013-03-17 14:16:01	User028	yeah i get that
2013-03-17 14:18:04	stormcrow	ah. then was there something specific you were referring to, or was it a generic "what can go wrong with a function call?" question?
2013-03-17 14:18:52	User028	i was referring to the call to main at the end
2013-03-17 14:18:58	User028	to get my main() function to execute
2013-03-17 14:19:14	User028	why isn't it being called, even though I call it?
2013-03-17 14:19:43	stormcrow	got it
2013-03-17 14:21:08	stormcrow	it actually is being called, but it's just that soemthing in the middle is breaking down, so it's spitting out that main wasn't finishing properly
2013-03-17 14:22:11	stormcrow	er, assuming I understand what you're asking
2013-03-17 14:23:49	User028	okay yeah that answers my question
2013-03-17 14:24:18	User028	thanks for putting up with my random questions
2013-03-17 14:24:25	User028	it's actually helping me
2013-03-17 14:24:29	stormcrow	happy to help
2013-03-17 14:24:59	User028	okay so i updated my program to include the rest of the main() function that calls the functions on the other .py file
2013-03-17 14:25:07	User028	it makes more sense now
2013-03-17 14:25:28	stormcrow	ok, could you pastebin it for me so I can see where we are?

2013-03-17 14:28:03	stormcrow	ah, yes, that would help
2013-03-17 14:28:08	stormcrow	now, about that error...
2013-03-17 14:28:57	User028	i should expect 2 arguments
2013-03-17 14:29:00	User028	i set it up that way
2013-03-17 14:29:05	User028	on line 55?
2013-03-17 14:29:17	stormcrow	it's, um, it's looking like the problem might be with the code you were given?
2013-03-17 14:29:28	stormcrow	just a minute, let me look again
2013-03-17 14:29:41	User028	i mean, we can chnge any of the code
2013-03-17 14:29:45	User028	it was just an example
2013-03-17 14:30:34	stormcrow	ah, OK
2013-03-17 14:30:41	stormcrow	'cause we're gonna need to
2013-03-17 14:30:44	User028	:)
2013-03-17 14:31:30	stormcrow	input() is only supposed to take one argument
2013-03-17 14:32:15	User028	okay let me see
2013-03-17 14:32:42	User028	hm
2013-03-17 14:32:53	User028	so i guess i can just do "print(valid_responses)"
2013-03-17 14:32:59	User028	that would work just as well
2013-03-17 14:33:12	stormcrow	not quite
2013-03-17 14:33:45	stormcrow	input("Please enter something:") will print out "Please enter something:" and then wait for user input
2013-03-17 14:34:08	User028	yeah and that's good because i have another whole function that prints out the list of valid responses
2013-03-17 14:34:18	stormcrow	right
2013-03-17 14:35:04	stormcrow	but the other argument there isn't supposed to be in input()
2013-03-17 14:35:57	stormcrow	print valid_responses (as it's currently written) and you'll literally get ["a","d", "m", "p"] on the screen
2013-03-17 14:36:34	User028	hmm, are you on line 55?
2013-03-17 14:36:45	stormcrow	yup
2013-03-17 14:37:06	User028	oh right - yeah,
2013-03-17 14:37:18	User028	that's why i deleted the "print(valid_responses)
2013-03-17 14:37:36	User028	it doesn't do what i meant, and i have my printMenu() function that does what i want
2013-03-17 14:37:45	stormcrow	right
2013-03-17 14:38:27	User028	everything works now!
2013-03-17 14:38:32	User028	no more of the old errors
2013-03-17 14:38:48	User028	now i just have to figure out why it's not communicating with my other python program file
2013-03-17 14:39:13	User028	cuz when i enter my choice "a" it doesn't then run the corresponding program in the other file
2013-03-17 14:39:42	stormcrow	you've got the file named Functions.py in the same folder as this file with this code?
2013-03-17 14:41:05	stormcrow	oh, it's because you're not actually calling the function you want in the code in this file
2013-03-17 14:42:36	stormcrow	right now, you've just got it saying "if this is a valid option, ask for another option, print out what that was, print the menu again, and keep doing that until a non-valid option is entered

2013-03-17 14:48:15	User706	cool
2013-03-17 14:48:19	stormcrow	it's because you're not actually calling the function you want
2013-03-17 14:49:04	User706	really?
2013-03-17 14:49:06	stormcrow	right now, you've just got it saying "if this is a valid option, ask for another option, print out what that was, print the menu again, and keep doing that until a non-valid option is entered"
2013-03-17 14:49:10	User706	cuz i definitely want to call main()
2013-03-17 14:49:32	stormcrow	OK, yes, you do, but you're not actually calling any of the functions in the other file
2013-03-17 14:49:39	User706	hmmmm
2013-03-17 14:49:46	User706	let me see
2013-03-17 14:50:33	User706	i'm not?
2013-03-17 14:50:41	User706	if ch == m:                 modifyEmployee()
2013-03-17 14:50:46	User706	that doesn't call it?
2013-03-17 14:51:20	stormcrow	ah, right, sorry. forgot to close the tab with the old code and was looking at that one by mistake
2013-03-17 14:51:31	User706	cool cool
2013-03-17 14:52:36	stormcrow	OK, I think I'm looking at the right now
2013-03-17 14:53:25	stormcrow	as it stands, you're jumping up to responses(), which is actually still causing that problem I mentioned
2013-03-17 14:53:53	stormcrow	it gets what choice you want, then gets stuck in a loop if you give it a valid response
2013-03-17 14:54:12	User706	yeah
2013-03-17 14:54:15	User706	okay i'm working on it
2013-03-17 14:55:09	stormcrow	got it
2013-03-17 14:59:31	User706	whoa
2013-03-17 15:00:13	User706	i got rid of the "continue" after if (a == "y"):
2013-03-17 15:00:23	User706	and then it printed this:
2013-03-17 15:00:42	User706	on darwin Type "copyright", "credits" or "lic
2013-03-17 15:00:52	stormcrow	oh, geez, I missed that continue (getting rid of it was the right answer)
2013-03-17 15:01:03	User706	yay!
2013-03-17 15:01:48	stormcrow	it just printed that part of a line?
2013-03-17 15:01:53	User706	but what does "on darwin" mean?
2013-03-17 15:02:07	User706	it printed this: a - add a new employee   d - delete an employee   m - modify an employee   p - print all employees Welcome to the Payroll System. What would you like to do? Select a choice. a] on darwin Type "copyright", "credits" or "lic
2013-03-17 15:02:25	User706	so the menu is working
2013-03-17 15:03:55	stormcrow	if you're using a Mac, darwin is part of OS X
2013-03-17 15:04:09	User706	cool
2013-03-17 15:04:12	User706	i'm using a mac
2013-03-17 15:04:31	User706	but this is highly irregular
2013-03-17 15:04:36	stormcrow	not sure why it would print that, though
2013-03-17 15:04:45	User706	it's one special program!
2013-03-17 15:04:54	stormcrow	apparently!
2013-03-17 15:05:15	User706	i feel like this should bring in the functions from my other file
2013-03-17 15:05:18	User706	but it's not doing that
2013-03-17 15:05:22	User706	let me show you the other file:
2013-03-17 15:07:15	User706	http://pastebin.com/PTZUuf1y
2013-03-17 15:07:24	User706	right now, only choice a's code is written
2013-03-17 15:09:14	stormcrow	in the last version of the main() code that I saw, you weren't passing it anything to addEmployee(), so that'll cause some issue
2013-03-17 15:09:32	stormcrow	not sure why it would start printing what it did, though
2013-03-17 15:10:25	stormcrow	I actually need head off to the school right now, so I'll be offline for an hour or so
2013-03-17 15:10:34	User706	cool
2013-03-17 15:10:38	User706	i'm going to school too now anyway
2013-03-17 15:10:47	User706	all of the CS161 students
2013-03-17 15:10:56	User706	will be in the CS lab until midnight probably!
2013-03-17 15:10:59	User706	:)
2013-03-17 15:11:03	User706	thanks for all of your help!
2013-03-17 15:11:14	stormcrow	yeah, I've seen a number of cs161 students in the CS lounge over the past couple days
2013-03-17 15:11:38	User706	yeah i was there yesterday
2013-03-17 15:11:48	User706	anyway, have a good day
2013-03-17 15:11:50	User706	bye
2013-03-17 15:11:59	stormcrow	bye!
2013-03-17 15:26:08	<--	User706 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has quit (Quit: CGI:IRC (Ping timeout))
2013-03-17 16:29:38	-->	User247 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-03-17 16:30:16	User247	hey is stormcrow back?
2013-03-17 16:33:06	User247	i guess not
2013-03-17 16:33:08	User247	:(
2013-03-17 16:33:38	User247	i know it's not tutor hours, but is anyone at the CS lounge who knows python at all?
2013-03-17 16:35:02	User247	nobody?
2013-03-17 16:40:32	User247	hello?
2013-03-17 16:40:40	stormcrow	User247: Just got back online
2013-03-17 16:40:55	stormcrow	still having trouble?
2013-03-17 16:42:17	User247	i'm going to be working on this unti midnight
2013-03-17 16:42:31	User247	yeah lots of trouble
2013-03-17 16:43:28	stormcrow	ok, what sort of trouble are you having?
2013-03-17 16:44:32	User247	well, i'm trying to find a way to replace items in the dictinary i create
2013-03-17 16:45:35	User247	so i open a .txt file
2013-03-17 16:45:39	User247	and then i turn it into a list
2013-03-17 16:45:43	User247	and then i turn that list into a dictionary
2013-03-17 16:46:10	User247	and then i need to be able to go in and replace parts of that list
2013-03-17 16:46:25	User247	so for example, i have this person's payroll info:
2013-03-17 16:47:25	User247	SMITH, James, 20, 300, 5000
2013-03-17 16:47:50	User247	that info is inputted as a dictionary
2013-03-17 16:48:24	User247	but it gets stored in a list
2013-03-17 16:48:30	User247	ugh i'm all confused
2013-03-17 16:48:31	stormcrow	ok, and the key for the dictionary is the last name?
2013-03-17 16:48:43	User247	no the keys are last name, first name, rate, hours, gross pay
2013-03-17 16:50:12	User247	so i ask the user:
2013-03-17 16:50:52	User247	def addEmployee(employeeList):     person = dict()     person["last_name"] = input("Enter last name")     person["first_name"] = input("Enter first name")     person["rate"] = float.input("Enter rate")     person["gross"] = float.input("Enter gross pay")     employeeList.append(person)     print(employeeList)
2013-03-17 16:51:04	User247	crap i have to input this into pastebin.org
2013-03-17 16:51:29	User247	http://pastebin.com/G1nAUQkC
2013-03-17 16:51:46	User247	see i think this really works well for adding people to the list
2013-03-17 16:52:01	User247	but it's really complicated to modify the info once it's been inputted
2013-03-17 16:52:34	stormcrow	yeah, I can see how it works, but then modifying things can indeed be interesting
2013-03-17 16:53:00	User247	do you see any problems with that little bit of code?
2013-03-17 16:53:55	stormcrow	maybe. how are you specifying which employee would have info changed?
2013-03-17 16:54:19	User247	maybe if i have a counter or i add another numerical number to the front of each person's info?
2013-03-17 16:54:28	User247	i don't know yet
2013-03-17 16:54:35	stormcrow	like, if I want to have chage the info for Bob Smith, would I enter his last name into the prompt?
2013-03-17 16:54:41	stormcrow	ah, ok then
2013-03-17 16:54:42	User247	yes, last name
2013-03-17 16:55:22	stormcrow	well, the way I would personally do it would be to actually have a dictionary of lists
2013-03-17 16:56:09	stormcrow	so that the key for Bob Smith would be "Smith", which points to a list [ "Smith", "Bob", ... ]
2013-03-17 16:57:20	User247	hm
2013-03-17 16:57:47	stormcrow	then you modify the list attached to each employee as needed
2013-03-17 16:58:02	User247	or the key could be a number
2013-03-17 16:58:25	User247	okay i think i see how i could do that
2013-03-17 16:58:28	stormcrow	possible, if you are going to have the user supply a number
2013-03-17 16:59:05	User247	okay
2013-03-17 16:59:56	User247	so first, i create an empty dictionary, then i create an empty list, then i convert the dictionary into a list, and then I mess around with the values of the list as the user modifies the dictionary?
2013-03-17 17:00:18	stormcrow	er, not quite
2013-03-17 17:00:27	stormcrow	first, create th dictionary
2013-03-17 17:00:45	stormcrow	then, with each new employee, put the info in as elements of the list
2013-03-17 17:01:09	stormcrow	then assign that list to a key of the employee's last name in the dictionary
2013-03-17 17:01:18	stormcrow	then start over with a new list for the next employee
2013-03-17 17:02:54	stormcrow	when you need to modify the employee's info, just pull up the list with the emplyee's last name, make the changes you need to, and store it again
2013-03-17 17:03:16	stormcrow	(if you know much about pointers, you can skip a step in there, but that's a bit more complicated than we need to get into here)
2013-03-17 17:03:35	User247	i can ask the user for the position on the list they want to modify?
2013-03-17 17:04:37	User247	yeah that's what i'll have to do
2013-03-17 17:04:49	User247	but what if they wantt o change the last name of the person?
2013-03-17 17:04:57	User247	then i'll have to change the key in the dictionary?
2013-03-17 17:05:02	stormcrow	then things get interesting
2013-03-17 17:05:22	stormcrow	you can actually delete the old key in the dictionary and store the list under the new key
2013-03-17 17:06:35	stormcrow	just make sure you notice that special case and deal with in the code
2013-03-17 17:06:57	stormcrow	it's only one extra line
2013-03-17 17:10:20	User247	okay i'm going to work on it for a while and then get back to you, okay?
2013-03-17 17:10:23	User247	thanks for your ideas
2013-03-17 17:10:47	stormcrow	no problem
2013-03-17 17:11:01	stormcrow	good luck!
2013-03-17 17:11:19	User247	thank you!
2013-03-17 17:13:45	User247	oooo so every time a new employee is added, i have to create a new dictionary!
2013-03-17 17:14:20	User247	nooooo
2013-03-17 17:14:50	User247	every person has a last name as a key and all the rest as the value (the list is a value in a key-value pair in the dictionary)
2013-03-17 17:14:53	User247	there is only one dictionary
2013-03-17 17:15:41	User247	every person is a key-value pair in the same dictionary?
2013-03-17 17:29:44	stormcrow	yup
2013-03-17 17:30:01	stormcrow	where the key is the last name, and the value is the list of info for them
2013-03-17 17:56:30	pilgrimd	24
2013-03-17 18:04:21	User247	i got the first "add a person" function to work!!
2013-03-17 18:04:25	User247	soo excited about that
2013-03-17 18:07:23	stormcrow	congrats!
2013-03-17 18:22:12	User247	you there?
2013-03-17 18:22:23	User247	okay this is super weird
2013-03-17 18:22:35	User247	this function is so easy, i don't know why it won't work
2013-03-17 18:22:36	User247	http://pastebin.com/my2mSEs0
2013-03-17 18:22:43	stormcrow	let's see...
2013-03-17 18:25:07	User247	it print out absolutely nothing
2013-03-17 18:25:11	stormcrow	Ok, so PayRoll is a dictionary holding all the data, but you're not actually asking for the data from PayRoll.
2013-03-17 18:25:31	stormcrow	according to this code, you're asking for the information from an empty list
2013-03-17 18:26:16	User247	okay yeah
2013-03-17 18:26:23	User247	i need to pull up the info using the key in the dictionary
2013-03-17 18:26:27	User247	got it
2013-03-17 18:26:29	User247	sorrryyy
2013-03-17 18:26:35	User247	: /
2013-03-17 18:26:57	stormcrow	don't worry about it. Everyone makes these mistakes from time to time
2013-03-17 19:03:42	User247	okay i'm at the point of asking the user what part of the person's list they want to modify
2013-03-17 19:07:23	User247	it helps when i talk it out
2013-03-17 19:13:40	stormcrow	yeah, they call it rubber duck debugging: talking out how you want things to go (even to an inanimate rubber duck) can help in working out how things actually should go
2013-03-17 19:17:40	User247	okay, i've got the add a new employee thing totally working
2013-03-17 19:17:59	User247	but i don't have the .txt file receiving the final dictionary at the end yet
2013-03-17 19:18:10	User247	but before i get to that, i need to fix my modifyEmploye() function
2013-03-17 19:18:14	User247	okay, so here goes:
2013-03-17 19:18:42	User247	are you with me?
2013-03-17 19:19:01	stormcrow	yup! go ahead
2013-03-17 19:20:01	User247	so i ask the user for the key in the dic they want to modify the entry for
2013-03-17 19:20:19	User247	and i define the valid_choices
2013-03-17 19:20:32	User247	and then i need to link each valid_choices with a position in the list
2013-03-17 19:20:48	User247	and i've already had the user select the list through its key in the dictionary
2013-03-17 19:21:06	User247	how do i link a word to a position in the list?
2013-03-17 19:21:13	User247	like, can i say?
2013-03-17 19:21:18	User247	ummmm
2013-03-17 19:21:35	User247	so my dict name is PayRoll
2013-03-17 19:21:44	User247	and each key is referred to as "name"
2013-03-17 19:21:59	User247	while selection.lower in valid_choices:
2013-03-17 19:22:07	User247	replacement = input("what is the new", selection, " ?")
2013-03-17 19:23:14	User247	if selection = name:
2013-03-17 19:24:59	stormcrow	you want "if selection == 'name':" there, but so far so good
2013-03-17 19:25:24	User247	sorry, somebody was just asking me for help using a comp in the linux lab
2013-03-17 19:26:02	stormcrow	no worries
2013-03-17 19:26:13	User247	it's scarry that ppl r asking me for help on this hw
2013-03-17 19:26:17	User247	lol
2013-03-17 19:27:51	User247	awww shoot
2013-03-17 19:27:53	stormcrow	as someone who has asked more than his share of questions on first-year assignments in the past and is now on IRC helping other people with their first-year assignments, I know exactly what you mean
2013-03-17 19:28:29	User247	so i want the value associated with the key
2013-03-17 19:28:41	User247	and i want to find the 2nd element of that value
2013-03-17 19:28:46	User247	argh
2013-03-17 19:28:51	User247	brain is hurting!!!
2013-03-17 19:29:42	User247	well, when i added a new employee, my key was called "name" and my value was called "newEmployee"
2013-03-17 19:29:51	User247	so every "key" has a "newEmployee" linked to it
2013-03-17 19:29:53	User247	so i want
2013-03-17 19:30:14	User247	newEmployee[1] = replacement
2013-03-17 19:30:16	User247	i guess
2013-03-17 19:30:26	User247	does that make sense?
2013-03-17 19:30:30	stormcrow	not really
2013-03-17 19:30:39	User247	it does to me
2013-03-17 19:31:03	User247	replacement is the variable i assign to what the user inputs as the replacement "hours" or "gross pay" or something like that
2013-03-17 19:31:11	stormcrow	the syntax is more value = dictionary_name[key]
2013-03-17 19:31:20	stormcrow	value[position] = replacement
2013-03-17 19:31:37	stormcrow	dictionary_name[key] = value
2013-03-17 19:31:42	User247	yes, my value is my list, and my list name is newEmployee
2013-03-17 19:31:45	User247	we r on the same page
2013-03-17 19:31:56	stormcrow	Oh! got it
2013-03-17 19:32:01	User247	: )
2013-03-17 19:32:15	User247	sweet
2013-03-17 19:33:15	User247	i wonder if there's a more efficient way to do it
2013-03-17 19:33:23	User247	welp, i'll see if this even works first
2013-03-17 19:34:18	stormcrow	yeah, see if it works before you make it work better
2013-03-17 19:34:39	stormcrow	that way if your improvements break it, you have something that you know worked
2013-03-17 19:34:50	User247	yeah i still don't have the main function working yet though
2013-03-17 19:35:22	stormcrow	no worries, one piece at a time
2013-03-17 19:39:12	User247	okay, want to see what i have?
2013-03-17 19:39:53	stormcrow	sure
2013-03-17 19:40:41	User247	http://pastebin.com/n5wqgGxE
2013-03-17 19:44:49	stormcrow	alright, you need to make sure that the entries in valid_choices are strings, and I think you left line 12 unfinished
2013-03-17 19:48:02	User247	okay, yeah, line 12 was unfinished
2013-03-17 19:48:05	User247	totally
2013-03-17 19:48:07	User247	i don't need that
2013-03-17 19:48:21	User247	i agree valid_choices should be strings
2013-03-17 19:48:38	User247	so should i indicate that at the first appearance of valid_choices?
2013-03-17 19:48:49	User247	just str(valid_choices)??
2013-03-17 19:48:51	User247	like that?
2013-03-17 19:49:18	User247	actually, i think that because i have this:
2013-03-17 19:49:20	User247	valid_choices = [last name, first name, rate, hours, gross pay, gross]
2013-03-17 19:49:32	User247	i don't have to say that valid_choices must be a string
2013-03-17 19:50:42	stormcrow	I was thinking more along the lines of valid_choices = ["last name", "first name",...]
2013-03-17 19:51:16	stormcrow	the elements in that list need to be strings, other wise python will attempt to interpret them as something else
2013-03-17 19:51:53	stormcrow	and then promptly crash and burn when it finds out you're trying to have spaces in variable names
2013-03-17 19:52:11	User247	okay i'm researching it
2013-03-17 19:55:07	User247	selection.lower = (str(input("Which value would you like to change now? Choose:  last name, first name, rate, hours, or gross pay. ")))
2013-03-17 19:55:09	User247	thank you!!!
2013-03-17 19:55:11	User247	wow
2013-03-17 19:55:14	User247	i got it
2013-03-17 19:55:37	User247	good eye
2013-03-17 19:55:49	User247	*your eye
2013-03-17 19:56:02	stormcrow	the str() isn't needed, but it shouldn't hurt anything
2013-03-17 20:20:38	User247	my computer is freazing up inthe linux lab
2013-03-17 20:20:42	User247	probably because of the IRC chat

2013-03-18 16:54:32	lewisc	oh
2013-03-18 16:54:39	lewisc	that actually makes more sense
2013-03-18 17:01:50	Wren	Dies anybody in CS 251 have a copy of the sample exam?
2013-03-18 17:40:34	-->	shinyrachel (~rachk@host-78-40.dhcp.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-03-18 17:41:54	shinyrachel	hi friends, I have a classic sad story, last night my .py program worked & today it does not.  my .split function is not working.
2013-03-18 17:42:53	shinyrachel	is someone available/able to assist?  thank you.
2013-03-18 17:48:55	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-18 17:50:12	lewisc	shinyrachel: I am going to need some context, can you pastie your code and pm the pastie link to me?
2013-03-18 17:50:14	shinyrachel	it was splitting & adding a comma between each variable last night, but now it is behaving erratically.  here is the pastebin, I think: http://pastebin.com/BMwysJ79
2013-03-18 17:50:18	lewisc	also what class
2013-03-18 17:50:21	shinyrachel	cs 161
2013-03-18 17:50:37	lewisc	is zat professor Massey?
2013-03-18 17:50:45	shinyrachel	my payroll.txt file is in the same folder as the program
2013-03-18 17:50:48	shinyrachel	yeap
2013-03-18 17:51:40	lewisc	can I ask what error you are getting?
2013-03-18 17:52:14	shinyrachel	certainly: ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
2013-03-18 17:52:14	shinyrachel	googling led to a zillion different kinds of errors.  at least, to my eyes.
2013-03-18 17:53:53	shinyrachel	and then when trying it in putty, since IDLE acts wonky sometimes, I get the error: "ValueError: too many values to unpack"  ha ha!  one is "need more than 1" and the other is "too many"
2013-03-18 17:54:43	shinyrachel	to get it to run you will need a file called payroll.txt with three entries possessing five values each: last name, first name, wage, hours, and gross.  that much may have been obvious.
2013-03-18 17:54:59	lewisc	so...hmm
2013-03-18 17:55:03	shinyrachel	indeed
2013-03-18 17:56:04	lewisc	okay
2013-03-18 17:56:23	lewisc	so I know why it seems like a bunch of different problems (it's not)
2013-03-18 17:56:31	lewisc	so what type does split return?
2013-03-18 17:56:50	shinyrachel	are you asking if it returns a string or something?
2013-03-18 17:56:55	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-18 17:57:19	shinyrachel	well, I (am trying to) designate lastN and firstN as strings and wage, hoursWorked, and gross as floats.
2013-03-18 17:57:48	lewisc	it returns a list
2013-03-18 17:57:50	lewisc	Oh hey
2013-03-18 17:57:57	lewisc	you learn something new every day
2013-03-18 17:58:11	lewisc	so you are trying to "unpack" a list
2013-03-18 17:58:22	lewisc	this is the opposite of "packing" a list
2013-03-18 17:58:45	shinyrachel	sounds good
2013-03-18 17:58:54	lewisc	normally I would try to walk you through some convoluted method of bringing you to the answer, but in this case it's a syntax error
2013-03-18 17:59:02	shinyrachel	I want each list to be called by a key in the dict
2013-03-18 17:59:11	lewisc	and there's not real way to solve syntax errors without giving you the syntax so
2013-03-18 17:59:15	lewisc	let's say
2013-03-18 17:59:31	lewisc	a=[1,'a',3.0,null]
2013-03-18 17:59:35	lewisc	with me so far?
2013-03-18 18:00:12	shinyrachel	are you designating different types?
2013-03-18 18:00:18	lewisc	oh that's going to cause a different issue
2013-03-18 18:00:21	lewisc	uh yeah
2013-03-18 18:00:25	shinyrachel	1 int, a string, 3.0 float,
2013-03-18 18:00:35	shinyrachel	ok.  yes I am with you
2013-03-18 18:00:36	lewisc	oh
2013-03-18 18:00:39	lewisc	taht's a list
2013-03-18 18:00:43	shinyrachel	word
2013-03-18 18:00:53	lewisc	a is a list of none-homogenous types
2013-03-18 18:01:02	lewisc	which is dangerous but ignoring that for a moment
2013-03-18 18:01:10	lewisc	so then
2013-03-18 18:01:29	lewisc	[h,i,j,k]=a
2013-03-18 18:01:33	lewisc	will unpack the list
2013-03-18 18:01:44	lewisc	assigning the first element to h, the second ot j and so on
2013-03-18 18:01:46	shinyrachel	ok
2013-03-18 18:01:56	shinyrachel	ohhh ok
2013-03-18 18:01:57	shinyrachel	so
2013-03-18 18:02:16	lewisc	do you see where your prblem is?
2013-03-18 18:02:19	shinyrachel	should my list designating it to newEmpl be reversed?
2013-03-18 18:02:38	lewisc	nope
2013-03-18 18:02:44	shinyrachel	instead of, sorry for writing the whole thing out, but: newEmpl = [lastN, firstN, wage, hoursWorked, gross] SB [lastN, firstN, wage, hoursWorked, gross] = newEmpl
2013-03-18 18:02:52	shinyrachel	ok good because that isn't causing the error :)
2013-03-18 18:03:04	lewisc	there's a typo on the line above it
2013-03-18 18:03:12	lewisc	your implementation and mine are 2 characters apart
2013-03-18 18:03:33	shinyrachel	... no spaces?
2013-03-18 18:03:59	lewisc	[]
2013-03-18 18:04:00	shinyrachel	or the list sb designated at THAT point
2013-03-18 18:04:14	shinyrachel	hmm!
2013-03-18 18:04:38	shinyrachel	same error :(
2013-03-18 18:04:41	lewisc	you need to enclose your variables in []
2013-03-18 18:05:02	shinyrachel	the whole list of them, right?  like [a, b, c] = line.split(",")
2013-03-18 18:05:17	lewisc	yup
2013-03-18 18:05:20	lewisc	did that not work?
2013-03-18 18:05:26	shinyrachel	nooo it did not
2013-03-18 18:05:31	lewisc	hrmm
2013-03-18 18:05:33	lewisc	allright
2013-03-18 18:05:43	lewisc	can you pastie or email me your payroll.txt
2013-03-18 18:05:53	lewisc	lc@cs.pdx.edu if that's the path you want to go
2013-03-18 18:05:55	shinyrachel	ayup
2013-03-18 18:06:07	lewisc	I need to get this running before I can really diagnose your problems
2013-03-18 18:06:40	shinyrachel	sent
2013-03-18 18:07:12	shinyrachel	last night it was populating the dict juuust fine
2013-03-18 18:07:28	lewisc	give me 5 minutes to get your code running
2013-03-18 18:07:30	lewisc	same system?
2013-03-18 18:07:34	shinyrachel	nope
2013-03-18 18:07:44	shinyrachel	it was linux, I used both idle and the terminal last night to get it running
2013-03-18 18:08:04	shinyrachel	saved to github, hadn't made changes to that piece of the code for a dozen iterations,
2013-03-18 18:08:14	shinyrachel	minus comma
2013-03-18 18:08:23	shinyrachel	now I'm on my work windows machine
2013-03-18 18:09:25	shinyrachel	linux lab at school
2013-03-18 18:10:32	lewisc	haha
2013-03-18 18:10:33	lewisc	cool
2013-03-18 18:10:48	lewisc	so you should actually have those braces but apparently they don't matter
2013-03-18 18:10:50	lewisc	uh yeah
2013-03-18 18:10:51	lewisc	so uh
2013-03-18 18:10:54	shinyrachel	sb fine?
2013-03-18 18:11:05	lewisc	your payroll.txt?
2013-03-18 18:11:08	shinyrachel	ya?
2013-03-18 18:11:13	lewisc	does it have any blank lines?
2013-03-18 18:11:32	shinyrachel	OOOOOH yessss ok I remember that problem!  I had to re=make the payroll file ok ok ok give me one sec
2013-03-18 18:11:43	lewisc	Talk to me about what your code does when it hits a blank line?
2013-03-18 18:12:00	shinyrachel	terrible things.  one sec
2013-03-18 18:12:42	shinyrachel	GLORIOUS GOLDEN
2013-03-18 18:12:43	shinyrachel	ok.
2013-03-18 18:13:04	shinyrachel	so it works again!  right.  thank you!
2013-03-18 18:13:09	lewisc	you good?
2013-03-18 18:13:14	lewisc	well then carry on
2013-03-18 18:13:35	shinyrachel	99% good.  I am going to fiddle around and try to get it to not add a \n before the new entry in the dict
2013-03-18 18:13:54	shinyrachel	because it is of course that \n that causes big problems with the program running AGAIN
2013-03-18 18:14:07	shinyrachel	basically it works ONCE but not twice.  fiddle fiddle fiddle
2013-03-18 18:15:46	lewisc	oh
2013-03-18 18:15:56	lewisc	you might want to investigate stripping
2013-03-18 18:16:38	lewisc	docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.strip
2013-03-18 18:16:44	lewisc	Oops
2013-03-18 18:16:50	lewisc	that's the deprecated library
2013-03-18 18:17:24	lewisc	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_strip.htm
2013-03-18 18:17:57	lewisc	basically...call .strip() on the last assigned variable
2013-03-18 18:18:11	lewisc	it removes all trailing white space
2013-03-18 18:18:16	shinyrachel	will that put them all in one string though?
2013-03-18 18:18:58	lewisc	put all what?
2013-03-18 18:18:59	lewisc	no
2013-03-18 18:19:08	shinyrachel	ok let's try.
2013-03-18 18:19:24	lewisc	gross.strip()
2013-03-18 18:19:33	shinyrachel	hahaha
2013-03-18 18:23:22	lewisc	did it work
2013-03-18 18:23:23	lewisc	?
2013-03-18 18:23:28	shinyrachel	no
2013-03-18 18:23:34	shinyrachel	in a few different places too I tried it
2013-03-18 18:23:41	 *	lewisc needs to consider what he writes more often
2013-03-18 18:23:42	lewisc	hrmm
2013-03-18 18:24:14	lewisc	oh
2013-03-18 18:24:28	lewisc	you aren't adding '\n' to your print statements are you?
2013-03-18 18:25:23	shinyrachel	let me look. I don't think so
2013-03-18 18:25:58	lewisc	because print does that for you
2013-03-18 18:26:51	shinyrachel	nope nowhere
2013-03-18 18:27:23	lewisc	hu
2013-03-18 18:27:25	lewisc	huh
2013-03-18 18:27:39	lewisc	if you pasty your print code I would be willing to poke it
2013-03-18 18:27:44	lewisc	you you can just poke at it
2013-03-18 18:27:59	 *	lewisc doesn't really need to get involved if you think it's something you can handle
2013-03-18 18:28:35	shinyrachel	well, I am not getting anywhere on it.
2013-03-18 18:29:25	shinyrachel	okay, I am having a hard time narrowing down what I should paste
2013-03-18 18:30:18	lewisc	Oh
2013-03-18 18:30:21	lewisc	no
2013-03-18 18:30:36	lewisc	did you do gross.strip() BEFORE you added it to the list?
2013-03-18 18:30:37	lewisc	i.e.
2013-03-18 18:30:42	lewisc	gross = gross.strip()
2013-03-18 18:30:48	shinyrachel	I tried both before and after
2013-03-18 18:30:51	lewisc	a = [b,c,d,gross]
2013-03-18 18:30:53	lewisc	really?
2013-03-18 18:30:59	shinyrachel	hmm, well, I will try again
2013-03-18 18:31:14	lewisc	and you assigned the result to a variable?
2013-03-18 18:31:24	lewisc	because strings are immutable, so you can't change them
2013-03-18 18:31:31	lewisc	you have to capture the result in a variable
2013-03-18 18:31:37	lewisc	hence gross.strip()
2013-03-18 18:31:40	lewisc	will do nothing
2013-03-18 18:31:50	lewisc	gross = gross.strip() will do what you want
2013-03-18 18:32:17	shinyrachel	it says that the float has no attribute strip
2013-03-18 18:32:28	shinyrachel	BEFORE adding it to the list
2013-03-18 18:33:38	lewisc	really
2013-03-18 18:33:45	lewisc	when do you convert it to a float?
2013-03-18 18:33:51	shinyrachel	before I do the strip
2013-03-18 18:33:53	shinyrachel	well
2013-03-18 18:33:54	shinyrachel	actually
2013-03-18 18:34:00	shinyrachel	I define gross as an empty float
2013-03-18 18:34:08	shinyrachel	and then I assign it to the value in the .txt file
2013-03-18 18:34:57	lewisc	HAHA
2013-03-18 18:35:01	lewisc	you are on python3
2013-03-18 18:35:04	shinyrachel	yeap
2013-03-18 18:35:13	shinyrachel	3.3
2013-03-18 18:35:19	lewisc	allright
2013-03-18 18:35:26	shinyrachel	I mean, it takes the value from the txt just fine
2013-03-18 18:35:35	lewisc	let me install that noise
2013-03-18 18:35:57	shinyrachel	oh golly are you helping me from the POV of basic or some jive
2013-03-18 18:36:09	shinyrachel	(note, I know you are not helping me from the pov of BASIC)
2013-03-18 18:36:21	lewisc	umm, I assume you have a function somewhere that prints to a file
2013-03-18 18:36:23	lewisc	and no
2013-03-18 18:36:25	lewisc	python 2.7
2013-03-18 18:36:26	shinyrachel	yeap
2013-03-18 18:36:38	lewisc	python 2.7 and python3 have substantially different type semantics
2013-03-18 18:36:39	shinyrachel	ohhhh yeah apparently the changes are great between 2.7 & 3.x
2013-03-18 18:36:46	shinyrachel	up high my friend
2013-03-18 18:36:59	lewisc	yeah it was....complicated
2013-03-18 18:37:06	shinyrachel	6:36:43 forever in history
2013-03-18 18:37:30	lewisc	and I am in industry so 2.7 is what I do
2013-03-18 18:37:31	lewisc	okay
2013-03-18 18:37:34	lewisc	so
2013-03-18 18:37:43	lewisc	well
2013-03-18 18:37:59	lewisc	let me get 3.x installed and see what comes to occur
2013-03-18 18:37:59	shinyrachel	I'M READY
2013-03-18 18:38:01	shinyrachel	k
2013-03-18 18:38:22	shinyrachel	I am trying to slim down the pastebin I am making for you as well, so that these different things (mostly) have references
2013-03-18 18:38:51	lewisc	for reference, in python 2.7 (which is more widely used by us industry critters the variable was turned into a string
2013-03-18 18:38:59	lewisc	cool
2013-03-18 18:39:06	shinyrachel	hmm, ok, I see
2013-03-18 18:40:39	lewisc	so hmm
2013-03-18 18:40:40	shinyrachel	ok I am sending fns main(), doItAgain() (which is sorta a dumb fn but it is fine), choiceMenu(), choiceP(), and quittin().  the quittin() function is the one that seems to be writing things with an extra space at the end.
2013-03-18 18:40:58	shinyrachel	http://pastebin.com/uV4p7fVF
2013-03-18 18:43:02	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-18 18:43:02	lewisc	no
2013-03-18 18:43:08	lewisc	you aren't converting to floats btw
2013-03-18 18:43:12	shinyrachel	dang
2013-03-18 18:43:22	shinyrachel	what kind of lollygagging am I doing then
2013-03-18 18:43:35	lewisc	so python is a dynamic language
2013-03-18 18:43:45	lewisc	a variable can change type
2013-03-18 18:43:56	lewisc	but the contents of a variable(usually) can't
2013-03-18 18:43:56	shinyrachel	word
2013-03-18 18:44:00	lewisc	confused? good
2013-03-18 18:44:03	shinyrachel	yes a bit
2013-03-18 18:44:03	lewisc	so if Ido
2013-03-18 18:44:17	lewisc	s = "I AM A SCREAMING STRING"
2013-03-18 18:44:21	lewisc	s is a string
2013-03-18 18:44:35	lewisc	and the contents of s is "I AM A SCREAMING STRING" which is a string
2013-03-18 18:44:38	shinyrachel	haha ok
2013-03-18 18:44:45	lewisc	so then right below that I do
2013-03-18 18:44:48	lewisc	s = 10
2013-03-18 18:44:52	lewisc	s is now an integer
2013-03-18 18:44:55	lewisc	10 is an integer
2013-03-18 18:45:01	shinyrachel	ok word
2013-03-18 18:45:07	lewisc	and "I AM A SCREAMING INTEGER" is a string
2013-03-18 18:45:20	shinyrachel	that's why we can change variables inside of functions, because it is just going to take on whatever new value you assign
2013-03-18 18:45:23	shinyrachel	right?
2013-03-18 18:45:44	lewisc	in this way the "contents" of a variable don't change their type, merely the variable itself
2013-03-18 18:45:47	lewisc	umm
2013-03-18 18:45:48	shinyrachel	I mean, I guess in OR out of functions, this is a bit different than global/local variable issues
2013-03-18 18:45:49	lewisc	sort of
2013-03-18 18:45:56	lewisc	so there are 2 things going on there actually
2013-03-18 18:46:05	lewisc	there is another thing called pass by reference
2013-03-18 18:46:11	lewisc	for example if you do
2013-03-18 18:46:19	lewisc	def myFun(x):
2013-03-18 18:46:25	lewisc	   x = 5
2013-03-18 18:46:29	lewisc	and then you do
2013-03-18 18:46:34	lewisc	z = 10
2013-03-18 18:46:40	lewisc	myFun(z)
2013-03-18 18:46:46	lewisc	print(z)
2013-03-18 18:46:52	lewisc	what get's printed out?
2013-03-18 18:47:01	shinyrachel	5
2013-03-18 18:47:08	shinyrachel	since it's within the fn?
2013-03-18 18:47:52	lewisc	nope
2013-03-18 18:47:59	shinyrachel	dang.  ok.  give me a sec.
2013-03-18 18:48:26	lewisc	(this is really off topic. It's a good topic it's just off the main one)
2013-03-18 18:48:39	shinyrachel	ok.  so because the variable z was passed in to myFun(), it retains its value.  ?
2013-03-18 18:49:54	lewisc	so what's going on here is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference
2013-03-18 18:50:22	lewisc	and since I have to take off in 10 mins I am going to say google that
2013-03-18 18:50:25	lewisc	and get confused
2013-03-18 18:50:34	lewisc	and then sleep and google it again and get confused
2013-03-18 18:50:51	shinyrachel	haha.  okay.
2013-03-18 18:50:52	lewisc	this is the most complicated topic in all of CS most likely so I sort of don't want to go down this rabbit hole
2013-03-18 18:50:58	shinyrachel	thanks for all your help!  yeah I get that.
2013-03-18 18:51:03	lewisc	all right
2013-03-18 18:54:19	lewisc	allright
2013-03-18 18:54:38	lewisc	so the way to do this is to strip the whitespace
2013-03-18 18:54:52	lewisc	but you need to do it before you do anything else
2013-03-18 18:55:05	lewisc	so I would recommend, and bear with me because you probably haven't seen this
2013-03-18 18:55:09	shinyrachel	okay
2013-03-18 18:55:13	shinyrachel	*bearing*
2013-03-18 18:55:27	lewisc	line.strip().split(',')
2013-03-18 18:55:41	shinyrachel	I have actually seen that before, HOWEVER, where th do put it
2013-03-18 18:55:59	lewisc	you replace your line.split(',')
2013-03-18 18:56:02	lewisc	with that line
2013-03-18 18:56:06	shinyrachel	ohh and I think I've tried that.  nvl I will try it again!
2013-03-18 18:56:52	lewisc	and obviously it's actually a,b,c,d=line.strip().split(',')
2013-03-18 18:57:09	lewisc	I am eliding the variables
2013-03-18 18:57:36	shinyrachel	okay, it looks like it NEARLY COMPLETELY ENTIRELY works maybe
2013-03-18 18:57:48	shinyrachel	but it still adds another \n on to the end of the program
2013-03-18 18:57:52	shinyrachel	this is not the end of the world
2013-03-18 18:58:31	shinyrachel	but I do not see/know why that is happening
2013-03-18 18:58:53	lewisc	oh lol
2013-03-18 18:58:57	lewisc	you are doing
2013-03-18 18:58:59	lewisc	line\n
2013-03-18 18:59:01	lewisc	line\n
2013-03-18 18:59:03	lewisc	line\n
2013-03-18 18:59:12	lewisc	the last line needs to not have a \n
2013-03-18 18:59:16	lewisc	you want
2013-03-18 18:59:23	lewisc	line\n
2013-03-18 18:59:24	lewisc	line\n
2013-03-18 18:59:25	lewisc	line
2013-03-18 18:59:56	shinyrachel	what line #?
2013-03-18 19:00:01	shinyrachel	that is, of the program
2013-03-18 19:00:25	shinyrachel	oh haha nvm.  sorry.
2013-03-18 19:00:33	shinyrachel	is it the one in quittin()?
2013-03-18 19:00:34	lewisc	that's the data file
2013-03-18 19:00:39	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-18 19:00:46	shinyrachel	ok let's try
2013-03-18 19:02:18	shinyrachel	that makes it all one string
2013-03-18 19:02:24	lewisc	?
2013-03-18 19:02:31	lewisc	what makes it all one string?
2013-03-18 19:02:49	shinyrachel	taking out the \n at the very end (3rd to last line) in the quittin() funciton
2013-03-18 19:02:54	shinyrachel	*function
2013-03-18 19:03:40	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-18 19:03:51	lewisc	so you need to have the \n on every line EXCEPT for the last one
2013-03-18 19:03:53	shinyrachel	aannnnd I am off work.  so I have to leave.  but thank you for your huge help!
2013-03-18 19:03:57	lewisc	do you know about the join function?
2013-03-18 19:04:03	lewisc	cool

2013-03-19 10:51:08	Mcrouse	Im a cs162 student and I was wondering if you can use color schemes with VIM on our unix system?
2013-03-19 10:52:08	bowzr	you can, but your results will depend on the machine you are logging into
2013-03-19 10:52:19	bowzr	which one are you logging into?
2013-03-19 10:52:35	Mcrouse	uh.... chandra?
2013-03-19 10:52:37	@krinkle	Mcrouse: yes, you can
2013-03-19 10:52:47	@krinkle	but you have to change your terminal settings slightly
2013-03-19 10:53:00	Mcrouse	ok im using putty
2013-03-19 10:53:13	@krinkle	run the command `export TERM=xterm-color` on chandra
2013-03-19 10:53:47	Mcrouse	k that did nothing
2013-03-19 10:54:04	Mcrouse	with quotes?
2013-03-19 10:54:06	@krinkle	no
2013-03-19 10:54:12	@krinkle	but after you run it you should be able to vim with colors
2013-03-19 10:54:32	Mcrouse	will it say anything?
2013-03-19 10:54:41	@krinkle	no, it won't say anything
2013-03-19 10:54:53	Mcrouse	do i need to run any commands in VIM to get it to work?
2013-03-19 10:55:16	@krinkle	maybe ':syntax on'
2013-03-19 10:55:35	Mcrouse	omg its sooooo pretty
2013-03-19 10:55:41	@krinkle	:D
2013-03-19 10:55:57	Mcrouse	THANK YOU!
2013-03-19 10:56:15	Mcrouse	will i need to do all that each time i log on?
2013-03-19 10:56:23	bowzr	if you run the command in vim, yes
2013-03-19 10:56:29	@krinkle	to make the terminal settings perminant you should add 'export TERM=xterm-color' to the end of the file '~/.bashrc' (no quotes)
2013-03-19 10:56:46	@krinkle	to make the vim settings perminant you should add 'syntax on' to the file '~/.vimrc' (no quotes)
2013-03-19 10:56:58	@krinkle	if the files don't exist you can create them
2013-03-19 10:57:42	@krinkle	I should note that if you use karla's quizor account for your proficiency demo you won't have any of these settings
2013-03-19 10:58:03	Mcrouse	laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
2013-03-19 10:58:27	bowzr	yea i really hate those setting
2013-03-19 10:58:29	bowzr	s
2013-03-19 10:58:42	Mcrouse	but could i do the export thing on her account?
2013-03-19 10:58:59	@krinkle	yeah you probably could
2013-03-19 10:59:05	@krinkle	i'm not sure if she has a policy about it

2013-03-19 11:05:34	Mcrouse	OK im back
2013-03-19 11:06:04	Mcrouse	a tutor showed me something nift with vim where they could "window out" run some commands in chandra and then window back in my code
2013-03-19 11:06:16	Mcrouse	Does anyone know those commands?
2013-03-19 11:06:35	bowzr	are you reffering to "screen"?
2013-03-19 11:06:42	Mcrouse	maybe
2013-03-19 11:07:00	Mcrouse	without quiting VIM they could compile and run it
2013-03-19 11:07:09	@krinkle	one way to do it is to do :sh in vim to get to your shell and exit in your shell to get back to vim
2013-03-19 11:07:21	@krinkle	slightly dangerous since if you don't have vim open exit will exit putty
2013-03-19 11:08:23	Mcrouse	ok sh worked how would i get back into my text file?
2013-03-19 11:08:33	@krinkle	exit
2013-03-19 11:08:45	Mcrouse	OOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooh
2013-03-19 11:08:57	@krinkle	another way is control-z in vim to get to your shell and fg in your shell to get back to vim
2013-03-19 11:09:00	Mcrouse	ok so could i run and compile all from that shell without losing data
2013-03-19 11:09:12	Mcrouse	oh thats what he did

2013-03-19 13:03:21	lewisc	.equal() will not work

2013-03-19 13:03:33	bowzr	thats what i thought, thanks
2013-03-19 13:03:35	lewisc	think about about it
2013-03-19 13:03:43	lewisc	. dereferences

2013-03-19 13:04:35	lewisc	(note, this is not true in some languages, there are languages out there that specifically have a few things, notably toString() and .equal() defined on null. Java is not one of them)
2013-03-19 16:19:58	haus	or ruby has .nil?

2013-03-21 14:31:17	User967	sorry after each one? or just at the end of the bunch
2013-03-21 14:31:23	User967	i've never used that before
2013-03-21 14:31:39	lewisc	either works
2013-03-21 14:32:35	User967	same thing!
2013-03-21 14:33:02	lewisc	no success? all right
2013-03-21 14:33:07	lewisc	hmm
2013-03-21 14:33:14	lewisc	do you know how to use a debugger?
2013-03-21 14:33:51	User967	like gdb?
2013-03-21 14:34:14	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-21 14:34:32	User967	yeah i'll try it again
2013-03-21 14:34:42	User967	do you want me to just run it or do something special
2013-03-21 14:34:47	User967	i only know it a little bit
2013-03-21 14:35:11	lewisc	um
2013-03-21 14:35:51	lewisc	I want you to put a breakpoint in your display function
2013-03-21 14:36:12	User967	ok
2013-03-21 14:36:17	User967	right at the beginning of it?
2013-03-21 14:36:35	lewisc	no on the line of the first cout
2013-03-21 14:36:46	User967	ok
2013-03-21 14:38:45	User967	it doesnt really say anything that looks interesting
2013-03-21 14:39:00	User967	Breakpoint 1, Posting::Display_Posting (this=0xffbffa50, type=106 'j')     at Posting.cpp:231
2013-03-21 14:39:12	lewisc	when you hit that breakpoint type "print title"
2013-03-21 14:39:33	User967	$1 = 0x254e0 "sdf"
2013-03-21 14:39:43	User967	so the sdf is correct
2013-03-21 14:40:08	lewisc	and the same for desc and compensation and email
2013-03-21 14:41:13	User967	okay
2013-03-21 14:41:23	lewisc	are they all sane?
2013-03-21 14:41:57	User967	yeah except for email i typed in 'r' and this is what it says
2013-03-21 14:42:22	User967	$4 = "r\000\000\000\000\000\000\000?5\rT????\000\001C`", '\000' <repeats 29 times>
2013-03-21 14:43:01	lewisc	strange but I wouldn't worry about it
2013-03-21 14:43:20	lewisc	then type n
2013-03-21 14:43:24	lewisc	or next
2013-03-21 14:43:34	lewisc	which should begin printing statements?
2013-03-21 14:43:50	User967	yeah it just shows cout << "title" << title << endl;
2013-03-21 14:43:56	User967	do i just keep hitting enter?
2013-03-21 14:44:15	User967	or n
2013-03-21 14:44:32	lewisc	yup
2013-03-21 14:44:34	lewisc	n
2013-03-21 14:44:36	lewisc	or enter work
2013-03-21 14:44:54	lewisc	it will intersperse your code with the output of your code
2013-03-21 14:45:11	lewisc	co it should go cout << "title" << title << endl;
2013-03-21 14:45:17	lewisc	"title blah"
2013-03-21 14:45:21	User967	yeah
2013-03-21 14:45:25	User967	thats all good
2013-03-21 14:45:55	User967	then when it goes to the add function
2013-03-21 14:46:14	User967	oh wait its just calling the create function again
2013-03-21 14:46:38	lewisc	did it print everything correctly?
2013-03-21 14:46:48	lewisc	I am guessing you just found a bug
2013-03-21 14:47:03	User967	well i think it called the create function
2013-03-21 14:47:10	User967	i'll just email it
2013-03-21 14:48:15	lewisc	well, did it properly print everything out at this point? or was stuff missing
2013-03-21 14:49:20	User967	up until the weird stuff at my_list.add, eerything was fine
2013-03-21 14:51:12	User967	oh i think i did something weird to make it loop through twice
2013-03-21 14:51:37	User967	which is why is prompted again
2013-03-21 14:51:41	User967	aarg i'm not sure
2013-03-21 14:51:52	lewisc	um
2013-03-21 14:51:55	lewisc	okay
2013-03-21 14:52:13	User967	i'm no help
2013-03-21 14:52:31	lewisc	it's fine
2013-03-21 14:52:46	lewisc	so first off you were entering "n" into your program
2013-03-21 14:53:00	lewisc	it's important to distinguish between gdb commands and your programs command
2013-03-21 14:53:05	lewisc	but
2013-03-21 14:53:07	lewisc	that's fine
2013-03-21 14:53:29	lewisc	how many files is your code?
2013-03-21 14:55:17	User967	oh yeah
2013-03-21 14:55:19	User967	whoops
2013-03-21 14:55:45	User967	um 4
2013-03-21 14:56:58	User967	do you want all of them
2013-03-21 14:58:56	lewisc	yeah
2013-03-21 14:59:00	lewisc	I need to see what this is doing
2013-03-21 14:59:14	User967	okay
2013-03-21 14:59:16	User967	don't tell karla
2013-03-21 14:59:45	 *	lewisc is a tutor who has graduated from those classes
2013-03-21 15:05:30	User967	okay because she shouts about not sending our programs out
2013-03-21 15:07:27	lewisc	cool
2013-03-21 15:07:29	lewisc	okay
2013-03-21 15:07:34	lewisc	yeah no you should be very careful
2013-03-21 15:07:39	lewisc	lot's of shady people out there
2013-03-21 15:07:44	User967	yeah
2013-03-21 15:07:54	User967	and i dont want to fail over the last program
2013-03-21 15:08:45	User967	the thing that gets me about my problems is that i had the same code for my last assignment, before it included linked lists, and everything was fine
2013-03-21 15:09:03	User967	so now i'm having these weird issues and i've changed some stuff, but it's weird to me that everything is thrown off
2013-03-21 15:09:22	lewisc	it wasn't working fine
2013-03-21 15:09:29	lewisc	it was relying on undefined behavior
2013-03-21 15:09:45	lewisc	the fact that it HAPPENED to work fine in the instances when you tested != working fine
2013-03-21 15:09:50	User967	oh
2013-03-21 15:09:52	User967	shoot
2013-03-21 15:10:03	lewisc	valgrind is going all kinds of nuts over this
2013-03-21 15:10:15	User967	what's valgrind
2013-03-21 15:10:20	User967	is that your compiler?
2013-03-21 15:12:15	lewisc	but honestly that's not something I am going to worry about at the moment
2013-03-21 15:12:18	lewisc	so all right
2013-03-21 15:12:44	User967	ok
2013-03-21 15:12:46	lewisc	correct me if I am wrong you are working on the displa
2013-03-21 15:12:53	lewisc	and no, valgrind is a memory checking
2013-03-21 15:12:57	lewisc	engine
2013-03-21 15:13:00	User967	oh i see
2013-03-21 15:17:15	lewisc	cool
2013-03-21 15:18:39	lewisc	you aren't using dynamic memory allocation
2013-03-21 15:19:03	User967	yeah i use it for title and desc
2013-03-21 15:20:34	lewisc	ah
2013-03-21 15:24:01	lewisc	all right
2013-03-21 15:24:04	lewisc	well first off
2013-03-21 15:24:13	lewisc	if the user doesn't want to post again what happens?
2013-03-21 15:24:40	User967	it just exits
2013-03-21 15:25:02	User967	so they have to say 'y' to keep going to search if they want to
2013-03-21 15:25:53	lewisc	okay
2013-03-21 15:28:07	lewisc	so for some reason you are deallocating memeory that isn't allocated
2013-03-21 15:28:39	User967	oh how? i thought i had if statements for all my deallocating
2013-03-21 15:35:05	lewisc	your trouble is somewhere in display all or the functions that display all uses
2013-03-21 15:38:35	User967	hmm
2013-03-21 15:40:05	lewisc	oh
2013-03-21 15:40:07	lewisc	no it's not
2013-03-21 15:40:10	lewisc	oh this is subtle
2013-03-21 15:41:58	User967	oh boy
2013-03-21 15:42:06	User967	hahah great. a subtle problem
2013-03-21 15:45:51	lewisc	yeah...
2013-03-21 15:46:00	lewisc	god I love C++
2013-03-21 15:46:14	lewisc	it is the ONLY language I know with memory management semantics this subtle
2013-03-21 15:47:14	zaalatta	lewisc: Well? What's the problem? You're keeping us in suspense over here!
2013-03-21 15:47:41	User967	haha
2013-03-21 15:53:00	lewisc	okay...
2013-03-21 15:53:15	lewisc	I think the destructor is getting called twice
2013-03-21 15:53:38	lewisc	OH
2013-03-21 15:54:45	lewisc	nope
2013-03-21 15:56:32	-->	nUbee (~robw@stargate.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-03-21 15:58:57	lewisc	so somehow title is getting tampled on
2013-03-21 16:01:48	User967	by iteslf?
2013-03-21 16:03:00	lewisc	looks like
2013-03-21 16:03:02	lewisc	all right
2013-03-21 16:03:16	lewisc	at the end of add in list
2013-03-21 16:03:55	lewisc	a piece of a_post is getting trampled on
2013-03-21 16:06:56	lewisc	okay
2013-03-21 16:07:06	lewisc	that's...above my paygrade why it's getting trampled on
2013-03-21 16:07:12	User967	haha
2013-03-21 16:07:13	lewisc	for the time being get rid of the delete's
2013-03-21 16:07:23	User967	in the create_posting
2013-03-21 16:07:24	User967	?

2013-03-21 16:08:02	lewisc	you are bleeding memory left and right anyways so a little more won't matter
2013-03-21 16:08:09	lewisc	in ~Posting
2013-03-21 16:08:20	User967	oh man that sounds cheery
2013-03-21 16:08:27	User967	okay
2013-03-21 16:08:43	lewisc	you aren't worried about memory leaks at this point
2013-03-21 16:08:58	lewisc	it would be good if you fixed your memory management, but that would require a total rearchitecture
2013-03-21 16:09:05	lewisc	and I am guessing this is due soon
2013-03-21 16:09:15	User967	yeah tomorrow morning
2013-03-21 16:09:26	User967	at this point, as long as it does something right i'll be happy
2013-03-21 16:09:33	User967	im not a cs major, you might be happy to hear
2013-03-21 16:10:42	User967	do i take out the flush thing?
2013-03-21 16:12:13	User967	it still doesnt print anything else out
2013-03-21 16:12:26	User967	i may just turn it in like this
2013-03-21 16:12:35	User967	ugly, but at least its something
2013-03-21 16:13:44	User967	thanks for your help!
2013-03-21 16:13:59	lewisc	no the flush will be important
2013-03-21 16:14:03	User967	oh okay
2013-03-21 16:14:17	lewisc	you actually should probably just shove flushes all over the place and it will probably fix your problem
2013-03-21 16:14:41	User967	what does it do?
2013-03-21 16:15:31	lewisc	so C++ uses buffered io, which means it doesn't print to the command prompt until either it decides to or you call flush
2013-03-21 16:15:41	lewisc	anyways, sorry I couldn't be of more
2013-03-21 16:15:42	lewisc	help
2013-03-21 16:15:45	 *	lewisc has to go
2013-03-21 16:15:58	User967	no problem! thanks

2013-04-10 17:40:41	-->	kg459 (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-04-10 17:41:19	kg459	#cshelp I have a question regarding CS251 can anyone help me?
2013-04-10 17:41:57	watches	Probably
2013-04-10 17:42:18	watches	But I'll try until they get here
2013-04-10 17:43:12	kg459	Give a formal proof for each of the following tautologies by using CP. Do not use the IP rule.
2013-04-10 17:44:45	dondon	wouldn't happen to be in the Hein book would it? (not a tutor either)
2013-04-10 17:45:12	watches	So wait, are you asking what the abbreviations mean?
2013-04-10 17:45:32	kg459	yes it is in the hein book
2013-04-10 17:45:34	kg459	A → (¬B → (A ∧¬B))
2013-04-10 17:45:44	kg459	that is the equation
2013-04-10 17:46:16	 *	watches looks up u2227
2013-04-10 17:46:49	kg459	I though the conjuction rule for the subproof but it says A,B and this is A, negate B
2013-04-10 17:47:51	watches	So to be clear
2013-04-10 17:48:36	watches	You're trying to prove that A implies (that) (not B implies (A and not B))?
2013-04-10 17:49:04	kg459	Yes, using a formal proof.
2013-04-10 17:49:08	dondon	prove that it is always true
2013-04-10 17:50:02	dondon	so the subproof needs to follow CP, "from A get B"
2013-04-10 17:50:38	dondon	where the B in CP isn't the letter B but "True" right?
2013-04-10 17:51:12	watches	Well, probably the first step would be to expand out those "implies"
2013-04-10 17:51:14	kg459	So your saying there is a second subproof?
2013-04-10 17:52:27	watches	You could do it that way
2013-04-10 17:52:42	kg459	So something like..
2013-04-10 17:52:51	kg459	1. A                       P
2013-04-10 17:53:27	kg459	2.           ¬B             P[for ¬B → (A ∧¬B)]
2013-04-10 17:54:07	kg459	3.                                A          P[for A ∧¬B]
2013-04-10 17:54:58	watches	Oh, you know what's gross about this
2013-04-10 17:55:07	kg459	the negation of B ha
2013-04-10 17:58:37	watches	So... I'm not sure how much more I can steer you in the right direction without just writing a proof, but just to be sure: You've got it, right?
2013-04-10 18:00:52	kg459	No I still dont understand how you get A and not B from not B using the proof rules
2013-04-10 18:01:04	watches	Well, you kind of don't have to
2013-04-10 18:01:27	kg459	what do you mean I dont have to?
2013-04-10 18:01:32	watches	Basically, when you're within a subproof, you can assume all of the things in your propositions are true
2013-04-10 18:01:57	watches	So when you're in a subproof within a subproof, you can assume that all the things in both subproofs' propositions are true.
2013-04-10 18:02:10	kg459	so is 2 and 3 above the right idea?
2013-04-10 18:02:40	kg459	so by 2,3, and CP you can get the first subproof?
2013-04-10 18:03:13	watches	Er, sort of. The thing that makes A true is
2013-04-10 18:03:21	watches	Well, the fact that you've already declared A to be true
2013-04-10 18:03:33	kg459	in line 1?
2013-04-10 18:03:35	watches	Yep
2013-04-10 18:04:00	watches	And the thing that makes B not true is...
2013-04-10 18:04:28	kg459	is line 2?
2013-04-10 18:04:32	watches	Yup
2013-04-10 18:04:52	watches	You've declared that B is not true
2013-04-10 18:05:06	watches	This implies that B is not true
2013-04-10 18:05:16	kg459	But how do you use line 1 and line 2 to get A and not B because the Conj. rule says that B has to be true
2013-04-10 18:05:32	watches	Well, think of (not B) as C
2013-04-10 18:05:58	watches	If A is true and C is true, A and C are true.
2013-04-10 18:06:21	kg459	but by what rule can you come to that conclusion, or do you need the second subproof?
2013-04-10 18:06:40	watches	Basically, the subproofs are just expanding out your implications
2013-04-10 18:06:43	kg459	not B = C
2013-04-10 18:06:58	watches	C isn't a thing. I'm just using it as a name for (not B)
2013-04-10 18:07:13	watches	(not B) is a proposition, just like B is a proposition
2013-04-10 18:07:37	watches	Er, sorry, not proposition
2013-04-10 18:08:14	kg459	So lets see if Im on the right track
2013-04-10 18:08:35	kg459	I think I see what you are saying but Im having a hard time bridging the gap with a rule
2013-04-10 18:08:55	kg459	1. A                                  P
2013-04-10 18:09:40	kg459	2.          not B                    P[for not B implies A and not B]
2013-04-10 18:10:18	kg459	do you need a second subproof? Or can you not say 3.                 not B and A             1,2, Conj.
2013-04-10 18:10:28	kg459	Can you say*
2013-04-10 18:10:37	watches	Well, you can't just take A as an axiom. It's inherently already a subproof
2013-04-10 18:10:48	watches	Because you're asserting that A implies all that stuff
2013-04-10 18:10:55	watches	Which is to say "If you take A as given"
2013-04-10 18:11:00	watches	Which is essentially a subproof.
2013-04-10 18:12:00	kg459	so.....you would have
2013-04-10 18:12:46	watches	I'm not sure you actually have to write it that way because it's kind of a trivial subproof, but it's using the subproof construct to prove your basic assertion that A implies all that stuff
2013-04-10 18:12:55	kg459	3.                 not B and A             1,2, Conj.
2013-04-10 18:13:03	watches	Right.
2013-04-10 18:13:17	kg459	If we already stated A as a premise we dont need to have another subproof that states it again as a subproof
2013-04-10 18:13:28	watches	Right.
2013-04-10 18:13:51	watches	Oh, er, yeah, you're right
2013-04-10 18:14:13	watches	Heheh
2013-04-10 18:14:14	kg459	I guess I just dont see how we can use Conj. here because the definition says that A = true, B = true than A and B = true. But B != true.
2013-04-10 18:14:29	watches	But you're not asserting that A and B = true
2013-04-10 18:14:40	watches	You're asserting that A and (not B) = true
2013-04-10 18:14:53	kg459	then what rule do you use there
2013-04-10 18:14:58	watches	Conjunction
2013-04-10 18:15:20	kg459	haha but how if you are suppose to assert that A and B = true using that rule
2013-04-10 18:16:27	watches	Uh, you kind of can't.
2013-04-10 18:16:30	watches	But you're not trying to
2013-04-10 18:16:46	watches	Remember that what you're trying to prove is that A and (not B) is true
2013-04-10 18:18:30	kg459	So because by proof rules we are saying that not B = true
2013-04-10 18:18:40	kg459	and that A = true
2013-04-10 18:18:55	kg459	We can essentially say that A and not B = true
2013-04-10 18:19:00	watches	Yes.
2013-04-10 18:19:04	watches	And that's conjunction.
2013-04-10 18:19:27	kg459	But you have to essentially look at not B as C because than there is no negation to worry about
2013-04-10 18:19:39	watches	A negated proposition is itself a proposition
2013-04-10 18:19:46	watches	Like if I were to say
2013-04-10 18:19:54	watches	"watches is lying"
2013-04-10 18:20:09	watches	And I were to say "watches is telling the truth"
2013-04-10 18:20:23	watches	These could be phrased as A and B
2013-04-10 18:20:29	watches	Or they could be phrased as A and not A
2013-04-10 18:21:02	kg459	But if the rule of conjuction has not negation in it
2013-04-10 18:21:13	kg459	has no negation in it*
2013-04-10 18:22:59	watches	Er, explain

2013-04-14 15:45:18	cdaringe	hi all.  i have a simple inheritance/func overloading problem statement.  if you'd take a peek, id be grateful!  http://pastebin.com/8PL4fvPf
2013-04-14 15:56:00	pfaffle	cdaringe: are you learning dynamic binding?
2013-04-14 15:58:14	pfaffle	or - have you heard of dynamic binding?
2013-04-14 16:17:55	cdaringe	pfaffle: just last lecture. previewed it
2013-04-14 16:21:14	pfaffle	ok, cause that's what you're dealing with here. is this in C++?
2013-04-14 16:21:35	pfaffle	and has Karla (i assume it's her class) gone over the requirements for it?
2013-04-14 16:21:57	pfaffle	for dynamic binding to work, I mean.
2013-04-14 16:25:29	-->	Slim (~marchuk@stargate.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-04-14 16:26:01	cdaringe	yes it is c++, and yep, Karla's class.  next lecture.  maybe I should just hold off and wait :)
2013-04-14 16:26:33	Slim	This is 202?
2013-04-14 16:26:47	pfaffle	hehe, might be good. It's also good to get a head start! But in short, in order to get the behavior you're looking for, your code has to meet the requirements for dynamic binding.
2013-04-14 16:27:39	pfaffle	dynamic binding == the type of your object is evaluated at runtime (so the program will realize that it's an object of type Y in that array of Xs, and call the appropriate function.)
2013-04-14 16:28:18	pfaffle	static binding is what you have happening now, which means the program says "this is an array of Xs, therefore i call X's foo() function
2013-04-14 16:28:21	pfaffle	"
2013-04-14 16:32:00	cdaringe	pfaffle.  yea, understood.  thanks for the tips.  slim, yes*
2013-04-14 16:39:20	cdaringe	i couldn't wait.  slapped a virtual in front of my func def in the .h and now i'm smooth sailin!
2013-04-14 16:50:09	pfaffle	nice

2013-04-16 08:34:21	User239	i have a 201 question
2013-04-16 08:44:24	Wren	Ask away. Sometimes it might take a while but someone should answer.
2013-04-16 08:45:06	User239	okay
2013-04-16 08:46:05	User239	i don't know c. if the user is entering command line arguments, and my if statement condition requires a new entry, how to i let the user enter in new arguments?
2013-04-16 08:49:51	zaalatta	User239: You could prompt them for new arguments. In regards to command line arguments though, those are a one time deal
2013-04-16 08:50:10	User239	okay so i just return and start over
2013-04-16 08:50:22	zaalatta	Yeah, you could do that
2013-04-16 08:50:30	User239	fair enough
2013-04-16 08:50:32	User239	thanks
2013-04-16 08:50:37	zaalatta	You're welcome :)
2013-04-16 08:50:58	User239	actually i have another question
2013-04-16 08:51:23	User239	i haven't even tried using c on unix. do i have to do anything different than when i run c++?
2013-04-16 08:51:49	zaalatta	Um.. I don't actually know cuz I don't program in C
2013-04-16 08:51:56	zaalatta	You might have to use gcc instead of g++
2013-04-16 08:52:02	zaalatta	to compile
2013-04-16 08:52:04	User239	oh yeah that rings a bell
2013-04-16 08:52:46	zaalatta	If you're more comfortable coding in C++, I believe our professor for 201 said it was alright
2013-04-16 08:53:02	zaalatta	That's what I did mine in, at any rate
2013-04-16 08:53:46	User239	yeah i was going to, but i am horrible at pretty much all cs stuff
2013-04-16 08:54:00	User239	so i thought well maybe i should do c so i at least can go off his examples
2013-04-16 08:54:49	zaalatta	Yeah, that makes sense
2013-04-16 08:54:59	zaalatta	What's cool is that C and C++ are super similar to each other
2013-04-16 08:55:52	User239	yeah it seems like it. but this whole command line stuff is brand new to me. so in c++ is it just taking in input? or does c++ have command line
2013-04-16 08:56:51	zaalatta	In C++ to specify that you want the program to accept command line arguments, all you have to do is use "int main(int argc, char * argv[])" instead of "int main()"
2013-04-16 08:57:16	User239	oh some of his had that
2013-04-16 08:57:41	User239	so some of his examples were c and some were c++? i was distracted by the suspenders a lot
2013-04-16 08:58:06	User239	idk if you were in class last friday
2013-04-16 08:58:40	zaalatta	Hah, yeah the suspenders were awesome
2013-04-16 08:58:57	User239	no doubt
2013-04-16 08:59:02	zaalatta	But I think they're the same in both C and C++
2013-04-16 08:59:07	User239	are you going to be in the tutor area today?
2013-04-16 08:59:23	zaalatta	No, but I will be at the CAT next door
2013-04-16 08:59:32	User239	working at the desk?
2013-04-16 08:59:32	zaalatta	(I'm not an official tutor... shh!)
2013-04-16 08:59:35	User239	oh haha
2013-04-16 09:00:00	zaalatta	Hehe, yeah, working at the desk
2013-04-16 09:00:20	User239	well if i stop by can you help me with the hw?
2013-04-16 09:00:53	User239	maybe i'll try c++ again
2013-04-16 09:01:11	User239	i don't really want to drive into town if i don't have to
2013-04-16 09:01:44	zaalatta	Well, I am supposed to be working so idk if I'll be able to help you if you come in
2013-04-16 09:01:47	User239	okay
2013-04-16 09:01:53	zaalatta	But the tutors next door are super helpful
2013-04-16 09:01:59	User239	yeah they are great
2013-04-16 09:02:05	zaalatta	I'm sure you'll be able to get all the help you'll need
2013-04-16 09:02:13	User239	fo sho
2013-04-16 09:03:02	zaalatta	And of course you could just spam this chat, no one will mind
2013-04-16 09:04:03	User239	okay
2013-04-16 09:04:11	User239	i have one last question for you
2013-04-16 09:04:15	User239	then i'll let you go
2013-04-16 09:05:02	User239	if i do c++ how do i read in the command line? do i just start referring to argc? or do i have to use cin

2013-04-16 09:13:19	zaalatta	So long as you're using the right main function, you can just refer to argv and argc with no problem
2013-04-16 09:13:50	User239	okay
2013-04-16 09:14:01	User239	do i use iostream.h or just regular iostream
2013-04-16 09:14:09	User239	you can tell i don't have a clue about anything
2013-04-16 09:14:25	User239	it's not liking my iostream.h
2013-04-16 09:14:42	zaalatta	Um, I'm not sure the difference (he mentioned something in class but I forgot)
2013-04-16 09:14:50	zaalatta	But I use iostream
2013-04-16 09:15:03	User239	ok
2013-04-16 09:15:37	zaalatta	You're remembering your angle brackets? ie, #include <iostream>
2013-04-16 09:15:42	User239	yeah
2013-04-16 09:15:52	zaalatta	Okie dokie
2013-04-16 09:16:00	User239	i'm assuming i don't need stdlib.h then either
2013-04-16 09:16:20	zaalatta	I think you need it for something
2013-04-16 09:16:24	User239	oh ok
2013-04-16 09:16:28	zaalatta	One sec while I check the hw assignment
2013-04-16 09:17:22	zaalatta	Right, in part 2 of the assignment, you need to convert the command line args into a floating point
2013-04-16 09:17:35	zaalatta	using atof() which you get from stdlib.h
2013-04-16 09:17:36	User239	yeah
2013-04-16 09:17:44	User239	okay so that stands even with c++
2013-04-16 09:17:47	zaalatta	Yes
2013-04-16 09:17:51	User239	crap i hate cs
2013-04-16 09:18:04	zaalatta	Heh, it does get tiresome sometimes :)
2013-04-16 09:18:13	User239	are you a cs major
2013-04-16 09:18:17	zaalatta	Yep
2013-04-16 09:18:31	zaalatta	I assume you are too?
2013-04-16 09:18:35	User239	no way
2013-04-16 09:18:46	User239	what would happen to the world?
2013-04-16 09:18:59	zaalatta	Haha
2013-04-16 09:19:01	User239	i'm comp e
2013-04-16 09:19:27	zaalatta	Nice
2013-04-16 09:19:31	User239	yeah
2013-04-16 09:20:42	User239	so argc is the command line arguments. i dont understand what the other two are
2013-04-16 09:21:13	zaalatta	Argc is the count (hence the c) of command line arguments. It includes the name of the program - so ./a.out
2013-04-16 09:21:52	zaalatta	It's mainly used as a stopping condition when you're cycling through the actual array of args
2013-04-16 09:22:01	User239	oh so i don't need a counting variable
2013-04-16 09:22:05	zaalatta	No, you don't
2013-04-16 09:22:44	zaalatta	Argv is the array of char arrays that hold the actual strings passed to the program
2013-04-16 09:22:57	zaalatta	for example
2013-04-16 09:23:14	zaalatta	On the command line, if you typed "./a.out 1 2 3"
2013-04-16 09:23:21	zaalatta	Argc would be 4
2013-04-16 09:23:47	zaalatta	While argv would have "./a.out", "1", "2", "3" in it (sans the quotes)
2013-04-16 09:23:55	User239	i see
2013-04-16 09:24:05	User239	we don't need envp for this one?
2013-04-16 09:24:09	zaalatta	We do
2013-04-16 09:24:19	zaalatta	That's part 2
2013-04-16 09:24:34	User239	oh right
2013-04-16 09:24:37	zaalatta	envp is an array of your environment variables
2013-04-16 09:24:40	User239	dang
2013-04-16 09:25:16	zaalatta	Basically, the variables that build your environment
2013-04-16 09:25:31	User239	okay
2013-04-16 09:26:10	zaalatta	So all you need to do for the assignment is loop through the envp array using either a for- or a while-loop
2013-04-16 09:26:20	zaalatta	and display each element
2013-04-16 09:26:48	User239	yep
2013-04-16 09:27:17	User239	then use atof to put them together
2013-04-16 09:27:30	User239	yikes
2013-04-16 09:27:33	User239	hah
2013-04-16 09:27:35	zaalatta	Sorry, I mistyped earlier - atof is for the first part of the assignment
2013-04-16 09:28:10	zaalatta	Just concatenate all the command line args and send them as one string to atof and it will convert them to a float
2013-04-16 09:28:27	User239	ok
2013-04-16 09:30:30	User239	this is due tomorrow by midnight? or tonight by midnight
2013-04-16 09:31:31	User239	i think tomorrow
2013-04-16 09:31:57	zaalatta	I'm not sure cuz it doesn't specify in the syllabus or the assignment
2013-04-16 09:32:13	zaalatta	I would assume it's due by midnight tomorrow but you could turn it in tonight just to be sure
2013-04-16 09:34:10	User239	yeah

2013-04-16 21:57:48	User397	i have one quick question
2013-04-16 21:58:20	zaalatta	Dunno if I'll be able to help, but go ahead
2013-04-16 21:58:24	User397	i have to include an output file for cs201. the grader says i should record my terminal using script command
2013-04-16 21:58:47	User397	ive never done that i dont think
2013-04-16 21:58:56	User397	oh hey haha i was on this morning!
2013-04-16 21:59:06	zaalatta	Hi!
2013-04-16 21:59:07	User397	i got it all done. im trying to turn it in now!
2013-04-16 21:59:25	zaalatta	Congrats! I'm just finishing mine up now
2013-04-16 21:59:53	zaalatta	So your question now is how to display your environment variables?
2013-04-16 22:00:18	User397	i guess so. i just turned in the cpp file. but the grader emailed me back and wants this. i don't know what it is though
2013-04-16 22:00:43	zaalatta	If you look at the first page of the assignment, there's a table of test cases
2013-04-16 22:00:44	User397	i wrote her wording from her email
2013-04-16 22:00:48	User397	yeah
2013-04-16 22:01:28	zaalatta	How I understood it is to test your program with those test cases and save the output into a file
2013-04-16 22:01:58	zaalatta	Making sure that the output is the same as what the table says it should be
2013-04-16 22:02:24	User397	yeah mine for 12 doesnt show 12.0. it just shows 12. yuck
2013-04-16 22:03:07	User397	is there a special way im' supposed to save the output? haha i can't just copy it over onto a text file?
2013-04-16 22:03:44	zaalatta	You can copy it over to a text file or, on the command line when you run your program, use '>>' to append the output to a text file
2013-04-16 22:03:47	zaalatta	for example
2013-04-16 22:04:07	zaalatta	./a.out 12 . 0 >> outputfile.txt
2013-04-16 22:04:26	User397	oh really?
2013-04-16 22:04:28	User397	awesome
2013-04-16 22:04:59	User397	how did you get your 12 to output as 12.0? i used atof but it just gives 12
2013-04-16 22:05:24	zaalatta	I got 12 also but I figure it doesn't matter all that much
2013-04-16 22:06:14	User397	oh ok
2013-04-16 22:06:43	User397	okay i'll try your output thing. then i can take it off cyberduck right?
2013-04-16 22:07:13	zaalatta	Take it off cyberduck?
2013-04-16 22:07:37	User397	its the thing i have to get my files from terminal
2013-04-16 22:07:43	User397	and put them on my computer
2013-04-16 22:08:02	zaalatta	Oh, I see
2013-04-16 22:08:28	zaalatta	Yeah, that should work if it has in the past
2013-04-16 22:09:15	User397	okay
2013-04-16 22:10:09	User397	i'll give it a whirl
2013-04-16 22:11:59	zaalatta	Are you on a Mac?
2013-04-16 22:12:02	User397	yeah
2013-04-16 22:12:39	zaalatta	Ah, that's why. I'm running Windows and use WinSCP, which is why I didn't recognize Cyberduck
2013-04-16 22:13:09	User397	yeah i have a couple extra steps i think
2013-04-16 22:14:51	User397	i was looking at his table of inputs and outputs. but at the last couple, there are too many args right? so it shouldn't output anything
2013-04-16 22:15:18	zaalatta	Yes, that's what I got
2013-04-16 22:15:28	User397	ok i thought it was weird on there

2013-04-17 10:27:20	User054	okay
2013-04-17 10:28:23	User054	i made a master list of the ticket info that was ordered in one way, then for the other order i made a pointer to that list and reorganized it
2013-04-17 10:28:59	User054	the first one is made in the constructor, and it calls the other one, so they are made at the start of the program.
2013-04-17 10:29:22	User054	so now i need to make two functions that will output those lists when the user requests it.
2013-04-17 10:30:00	User054	i'm confused though on what my argument should be in these latter two functions to call the lists
2013-04-17 10:30:16	User054	its sort of a vague question. i might just keep going and then come in and have someone look at it
2013-04-17 10:34:27	@krinkle	yeah, the best way to get help with something like this is to come in and see us. It can be a little hard to communicate high-level/vague design ideas over IRC.

2013-04-17 15:55:29	User260	example: ~journal(void)
2013-04-17 15:55:47	User260	is that the same as ~journal() with no arguments?

My homework is to write a program in python to generate a version of the song popular with busloads of school children for years , " n bottles of pop on the wall" The program should ask the user to enter the number of pop bottles.
2013-04-18 13:47:21	bowzr	what is the problem you are having?
2013-04-18 13:49:48	User262	when I say that there are 5 bottles, I'm stuck in making it into a loop that will count down until it says that there are no bottles on the pop on the wall.
2013-04-18 14:01:14	bowzr	what loops are you familiar with?
2013-04-18 14:02:40	bowzr	well there are two basic types of loops, a while loop and for loop.
2013-04-18 14:03:54	bowzr	while loops should be used when you do not know the exact number of times you will have to loop through
2013-04-18 14:04:05	User262	when professor went over class lectures we mainly talked about while loops.
2013-04-18 14:04:38	bowzr	a for loop should be used when you know the exact number times you will need loop through
2013-04-18 14:05:13	bowzr	i would recommend a for loop for this case, but a while works just as well
2013-04-18 14:06:52	User262	Ill show you what I wrote
2013-04-18 14:06:59	User262	bottles=int(input("How many bottles? " ))
2013-04-18 14:07:28	User262	bottles = 5 while(bottles < 5 ):          bottles = bottles - 1  print( bottles, " bottles of pop on the wall,: bottles of pop take one down , pass it around, bottles of pop on the wall" )
2013-04-18 14:07:41	User262	  bottles = bottles - 1
2013-04-18 14:07:47	User262	print( bottles, " bottles of pop on the wall,: bottles of pop take one down , pass it around, bottles of pop on the wall" )
2013-04-18 14:15:44	bowzr	so im seeing that you are decrementing your int twice in the loop
2013-04-18 14:15:56	bowzr	wait never mind
2013-04-18 14:16:11	bowzr	i would put the decrement after the print statement
2013-04-18 14:16:41	bowzr	your syntax for "print" seems to be a little off
2013-04-18 14:20:17	bowzr	what exactly is the problem your are having? aside from removing your brackets from the print statement i dont see any problems with this
2013-04-18 14:20:39	bowzr	just make sure whatever you want in the loop is indented
2013-04-18 14:21:07	@krinkle	there is an issue with the condition for your while loop that you may want to check
2013-04-18 14:21:17	bowzr	oh
2013-04-18 14:21:18	kini	pop? shouldn't it be beer?
2013-04-18 14:21:20	bowzr	right that
2013-04-18 14:21:41	drbop	pop is the version for kids.
2013-04-18 14:21:45	bowzr	cant believe i missed that
2013-04-18 14:21:49	bowzr	krinkle++
2013-04-18 14:23:18	User262	ok ill try that.

2013-04-18 18:54:56	User953	my program for 163 won't compile, but i don't know how to fix it. i started fresh on this program so there's not much to look at yet.
2013-04-18 18:55:21	User953	it's saying that i haven't declared one of the functions in my list class, but it's in there so i don't get it
2013-04-18 18:57:56	User953	at this point i think i've just screwed up a couple simple things that i can't see

2013-04-18 20:22:18	pfaffle	did you put a function prototype up at the top of the class definition?
2013-04-18 20:22:47	User953	jesus. i just figured it out
2013-04-18 20:23:03	User953	 i was linking my .h accidentally to a different main.cpp
2013-04-18 20:23:12	User953	so ridiculous
2013-04-18 20:23:25	pfaffle	hah

2013-04-18 20:23:53	User953	dont go though
2013-04-18 20:23:56	User953	i think i still have questions

2013-04-18 20:24:08	User953	obviously
2013-04-18 20:25:05	User953	i'm confused about linking a function from one class to a function from another class

2013-04-18 20:27:52	User953	umm i havent learned about that so idk
2013-04-18 20:28:01	zaalatta	What class are you in?
2013-04-18 20:28:02	User953	i think i'm still linking up to the wrong file
2013-04-18 20:28:05	User953	this is stupid
2013-04-18 20:28:07	User953	163
2013-04-18 20:28:24	zaalatta	Can you describe the problem you're having?
2013-04-18 20:29:11	User953	its just giving me errors that shouldnt be there. i'm going to clean up this folder and then see what my errors are
2013-04-18 20:31:11	zaalatta	How many classes are you dealing with?
2013-04-18 20:31:16	User953	just 2
2013-04-18 20:32:02	zaalatta	Okay, and now you're trying to display data of one class from the other?
2013-04-18 20:32:10	User953	yep
2013-04-18 20:33:49	User953	okay i got my files sorted out
2013-04-18 20:34:06	zaalatta	Yay :)
2013-04-18 20:34:19	User953	ha yeah i feel like i need a reward
2013-04-18 20:34:39	zaalatta	Getting rid of those errors is a pretty awesome reward :)
2013-04-18 20:34:54	User953	oh no the errors are there. i just got the files in the right places
2013-04-18 20:35:08	User953	not really that much to celebrate unfortunately
2013-04-18 20:35:16	zaalatta	Oh, that's okay
2013-04-18 20:35:52	zaalatta	So, in order to be able to display data of class 1 from class 2
2013-04-18 20:35:56	User953	yeah
2013-04-18 20:36:16	zaalatta	You can have an object of class 1 in class 2
2013-04-18 20:36:45	zaalatta	But that's something of a headache
2013-04-18 20:37:10	User953	okay so if class one is list and class two is guest
2013-04-18 20:37:30	User953	i would have like "list the_ticket" or something?
2013-04-18 20:38:02	User953	don't i have to put that somewhere in my list class also? or no
2013-04-18 20:38:34	zaalatta	That would work but I wouldn't recommend doing it because it's a headache and you'll learn it in 202
2013-04-18 20:38:42	zaalatta	What I did for 163 is
2013-04-18 20:38:46	User953	luckily i dont have to take 202
2013-04-18 20:39:15	zaalatta	I had an object of each class in my main file that I just accessed certain functions from
2013-04-18 20:39:21	User953	oh right
2013-04-18 20:39:26	User953	i forgot about that
2013-04-18 20:39:40	User953	i already have those!
2013-04-18 20:40:06	zaalatta	Hrm

2013-04-18 20:40:25	User953	so if my object is list the_list then i can say cout << current -> the_list.section to show that section value?
2013-04-18 20:40:49	zaalatta	Well, you should have a display function in your list class
2013-04-18 20:41:14	User953	yeah i dont understand why i need a display in both classes
2013-04-18 20:41:16	zaalatta	that all you'd have to do is type "the_list.display()" in your main file and it'll do all the work
2013-04-18 20:41:37	User953	but i thought she wanted the user to never access anything from that list class
2013-04-18 20:41:47	User953	is it okay if it just displays?
2013-04-18 20:42:02	User953	if it's not a big deal then i'll do that
2013-04-18 20:42:21	zaalatta	That's what I did in 163 and I never had a problem with it
2013-04-18 20:42:27	User953	okay coolio
2013-04-18 20:42:34	pfaffle	well, by never access anything from the list she generally means the data
2013-04-18 20:43:02	User953	okay
2013-04-18 20:43:17	pfaffle	with "pure" object-oriented programming you don't want to allow other non-class entities to manipulate data directly inside the class
2013-04-18 20:43:19	User953	she makes me nervous with all her jumping around
2013-04-18 20:43:30	pfaffle	not sure if that's what she was talking about with that
2013-04-18 20:43:33	User953	even though its effective
2013-04-18 20:43:44	User953	yeah you are probably right
2013-04-18 20:45:41	User953	okay i got that. its giving me that weird error that says 'no output written to a.out'
2013-04-18 20:45:51	User953	that just means i'm not outputting anything?
2013-04-18 20:47:06	pfaffle	User953: err how are you compiling your program?
2013-04-18 20:47:39	User953	umm the normal way?
2013-04-18 20:47:40	User953	haha
2013-04-18 20:47:48	User953	sorry i only know one way
2013-04-18 20:48:13	pfaffle	heh
2013-04-18 20:48:21	pfaffle	i mean, like, what are you calling on the command line
2013-04-18 20:48:55	User953	i just say g++ themain.cpp
2013-04-18 20:49:25	pfaffle	hm is all your code in themain.cpp then?
2013-04-18 20:49:32	User953	no it calls thelist.h
2013-04-18 20:50:02	pfaffle	do you have a thelist.cpp?
2013-04-18 20:50:07	User953	not yet
2013-04-18 20:50:21	User953	i started over on this whole thing so i didn't want a million windows
2013-04-18 20:51:01	User953	i just include the list info in themain
2013-04-18 20:51:20	pfaffle	oh
2013-04-18 20:52:12	User953	that shouldnt be a problem right? i have my main function then below it all the list functions
2013-04-18 20:53:31	pfaffle	shouldn't be a problem, as long as you did a #include "thelist.h" at the top of your themain.cpp
2013-04-18 20:53:49	pfaffle	and your thelist.h contains function prototypes
2013-04-18 20:54:15	User953	yep it does
2013-04-18 20:54:18	pfaffle	did you get any other compile errors besides that?
2013-04-18 20:54:41	User953	nope. and its weird too because i even put in a little cout statement just for checking
2013-04-18 20:54:52	User953	so i would think that it would at least show that
2013-04-18 20:55:13	pfaffle	well compiling the program isn't the same as running it
2013-04-18 20:55:22	pfaffle	if compiling errors out, you won't have a program to run
2013-04-18 20:55:36	pfaffle	the cout statements only happen if you run your program
2013-04-18 20:56:01	User953	right thats sort of what i meant
2013-04-18 20:56:17	User953	i meant that if i have something outputting to the screen, i shouldn't get that error right?
2013-04-18 20:56:28	pfaffle	well that error means something different
2013-04-18 20:56:42	pfaffle	it means it wasn't able to create a.out (your compiled program)
2013-04-18 20:56:42	User953	oh i just assumed that
2013-04-18 20:56:49	User953	oh
2013-04-18 20:57:06	pfaffle	which is why i'm confused that you're not seeing any other errors
2013-04-18 20:57:43	User953	that makes two of us
2013-04-18 20:58:01	User953	oh wait
2013-04-18 20:58:06	User953	hang on
2013-04-18 20:58:12	pfaffle	ok
2013-04-18 20:58:23	User953	i have no destructor for one of my classes
2013-04-18 20:58:29	<--	magic (steierta@chandra.cs.pdx.edu) has left #cshelp
2013-04-18 20:58:41	pfaffle	well, that shouldn't make it not compile
2013-04-18 20:58:49	User953	oh haha well that did it
2013-04-18 20:58:52	pfaffle	though you probably need one
2013-04-18 20:58:55	pfaffle	hehe
2013-04-18 20:59:01	User953	oh great now i just seg fault
2013-04-18 20:59:03	User953	not surprising
2013-04-18 20:59:08	pfaffle	destructor or constructor? O-o
2013-04-18 20:59:34	User953	i had the destructor in the list class but hadnt made its own little function
2013-04-18 20:59:50	User953	well i dont know why i'm seg faulting
2013-04-18 20:59:56	pfaffle	heh heh
2013-04-18 20:59:56	User953	i'm sure i did something else dumb
2013-04-18 21:00:05	pfaffle	well, the good news is, your code compiles
2013-04-18 21:00:19	pfaffle	the bad news is, now you have to debug it
2013-04-18 21:00:21	pfaffle	:D
2013-04-18 21:00:40	User953	yeah its pretty bad news
2013-04-18 21:01:39	pfaffle	so my advice it to check out all the code where you are working with pointers
2013-04-18 21:02:04	User953	good idea
2013-04-18 21:02:17	pfaffle	before you try to access some_object->data_member, make sure that you ALWAYS test that some_object is not NULL before you do it
2013-04-18 21:02:25	User953	i do have a pointer in there but i don't really understand why its there. so i've probably done it wrong
2013-04-18 21:02:27	User953	okay
2013-04-18 21:03:21	pfaffle	along the same vein, always explicitly set your pointers to NULL when they don't actually point to valid data
2013-04-18 21:03:26	pfaffle	so that the above check will work, heh
2013-04-18 21:04:28	pfaffle	those are general tips at least which will serve you well in all cases
2013-04-18 21:04:38	User953	yeah
2013-04-18 21:04:51	User953	so i have 4 ints that i use as the ticket info
2013-04-18 21:04:58	User953	and they belong privately in the list class
2013-04-18 21:05:05	pfaffle	yeah?
2013-04-18 21:05:16	User953	so i have a list function called build_list
2013-04-18 21:05:27	pfaffle	ok
2013-04-18 21:05:43	User953	it starts a loop that will change those variables a little each iteration so they are diff for each node
2013-04-18 21:06:06	User953	then that function calls make_list1 which sets the section, price, etc with those values
2013-04-18 21:06:16	User953	and creates the linked list
2013-04-18 21:07:01	pfaffle	okay, i think i understand
2013-04-18 21:07:14	User953	since those ints - pr, sect, avail, vis - belong to the class, do i need to still pass them as arguments for make_list?
2013-04-18 21:07:22	User953	does that make sense
2013-04-18 21:07:28	pfaffle	I think so.
2013-04-18 21:07:32	pfaffle	You don't have to pass them, no
2013-04-18 21:07:48	User953	okay bc i have them as arguments but i dont really get why i have to
2013-04-18 21:08:01	pfaffle	if they're class variables, and if the functions that work with them are also inside the class, those functions can access them
2013-04-18 21:08:02	User953	unless its because they are being changed by the first fn
2013-04-18 21:08:13	User953	yeah thats what i thought!
2013-04-18 21:08:14	pfaffle	main can't, not directly, but any class functions can
2013-04-18 21:08:22	User953	ok
2013-04-18 21:08:32	User953	i'll take them out and see if that helps anything. probably wont
2013-04-18 21:09:01	pfaffle	well, if they're just straight-up ints and not pointers to ints, then no that probably won't help
2013-04-18 21:09:11	User953	right
2013-04-18 21:09:13	pfaffle	segfaults happen when you do bad things with ponters
2013-04-18 21:09:18	User953	haha
2013-04-18 21:09:21	pfaffle	er pointers
2013-04-18 21:10:13	pfaffle	though i guess if while you are generating a list, if you try to set one of those data members without checking that the object you're setting it inside isn't null yet, then it will segfault
2013-04-18 21:10:33	User953	hmm
2013-04-18 21:10:55	pfaffle	like object->next->sect
2013-04-18 21:11:02	pfaffle	(since this is a linked list, right?)
2013-04-18 21:11:06	User953	yeah
2013-04-18 21:11:29	User953	can i show you my build_list and make_list functions
2013-04-18 21:13:07	User953	in the constructor i set my pr, vis, sect, avail to their beginning values of the list. is that a problem? i thought it would eliminate the one line of setting them null
2013-04-18 21:13:30	pfaffle	that should be fine
2013-04-18 21:14:03	pfaffle	yeah, if you wanna show me your functions put em in pastie.org and send the link to me privately
2013-04-18 21:14:25	User953	do i just go to pastie.org? or is that through here
2013-04-18 21:14:43	User953	oh
2013-04-18 21:15:42	pfaffle	just go to the website, it gives you a spot to paste stuff like code, then gives you a link to give people who want to see it
2013-04-18 21:16:02	pfaffle	easier and more effective than pasting straight into chat
2013-04-18 21:16:07	User953	oh shoot
2013-04-18 21:16:13	User953	i think i just posted it public
2013-04-18 21:16:15	User953	what an idiot
2013-04-18 21:16:54	User953	i didnt hit the lock button!
2013-04-18 21:17:18	User953	at least it wasnt the whole program
2013-04-18 21:17:20	User953	i guess
2013-04-18 21:18:22	User953	oh
2013-04-18 21:18:42	User953	so i paste the link on here?
2013-04-18 21:23:05	pfaffle	paste the link in a PM to me
2013-04-18 21:23:12	pfaffle	(can you PM in that web client thing?)
2013-04-18 21:24:02	User953	not that i can see
2013-04-18 21:24:14	User953	unless theres like special syntax for it
2013-04-18 21:26:35	pfaffle	hmm
2013-04-18 21:26:42	pfaffle	seem to be some double-slashes in weird places
2013-04-18 21:26:55	pfaffle	is that in the code too? O-o
2013-04-18 21:30:23	pfaffle	User953: ?
2013-04-18 21:30:39	User953	oh yeah those were the ints i had as arguments
2013-04-18 21:30:44	User953	i just commented them out
2013-04-18 21:31:26	pfaffle	oh i see
2013-04-18 21:32:03	pfaffle	well as it stands that shouldn't compile, because you are using those variables in both functions
2013-04-18 21:32:31	User953	why doesnt that work?
2013-04-18 21:32:53	pfaffle	if you don't declare the variables you can't work with them because they don't exist yet
2013-04-18 21:33:13	User953	they are declared in the list and the constructor
2013-04-18 21:33:37	pfaffle	oh
2013-04-18 21:34:26	User953	i can send  you more if that would help
2013-04-18 21:35:15	pfaffle	no that's fine i guess
2013-04-18 21:35:31	pfaffle	anyway, seeing different problems in the make_list function
2013-04-18 21:35:51	User953	also, one_ticket is an object of type ticket in my node struct
2013-04-18 21:36:15	User953	ok what do you see
2013-04-18 21:39:37	pfaffle	well, for starters you create a new temp node object
2013-04-18 21:39:55	pfaffle	and then immediately after that you set it to NULL
2013-04-18 21:39:55	User953	yeah
2013-04-18 21:40:10	User953	thats no bueno
2013-04-18 21:40:30	pfaffle	yeah, cuz in doing that you just lose the object that you just created
2013-04-18 21:40:39	User953	oh doi
2013-04-18 21:40:48	User953	ha good catch!
2013-04-18 21:41:26	pfaffle	then next i think the if (!head) statement following that, you haev your assignment backwards
2013-04-18 21:42:04	User953	ahhaha well it doesnt seg fault anymore
2013-04-18 21:42:13	pfaffle	you want the head pointer to point to your temp object right? right now you are assigning temp to get the value of head
2013-04-18 21:42:17	User953	it does the never ending list of numbers
2013-04-18 21:42:21	pfaffle	which presumably with an empty list is null :p
2013-04-18 21:43:03	User953	wait i thought that made temp the new head
2013-04-18 21:43:20	User953	are you talking about the line with temp -> next = head
2013-04-18 21:43:41	pfaffle	if (!head) temp = head;
2013-04-18 21:43:56	User953	yeah you were right. i changed that
2013-04-18 21:44:07	User953	i get them switched a lot
2013-04-18 21:44:13	pfaffle	heh yeah
2013-04-18 21:44:25	pfaffle	i find it helpful to think of it the way that karla always says it
2013-04-18 21:44:34	pfaffle	"x gets the value of y"
2013-04-18 21:44:55	pfaffle	in this case, the way it previously was, temp gets the value of head
2013-04-18 21:44:58	User953	yeah i think my problem might be that i get confused about what my goal is hahaha
2013-04-18 21:45:04	User953	yeah
2013-04-18 21:45:10	User953	and i guess i thought that was what i wanted
2013-04-18 21:46:46	User953	so now i have the data displaying, but it goes on forever until i control c
2013-04-18 21:46:55	User953	so i have to check out my display functio
2013-04-18 21:46:56	User953	poop
2013-04-18 21:47:18	pfaffle	i think that's an artifact of your make_list too
2013-04-18 21:47:29	User953	yeah you are probably right!
2013-04-18 21:47:35	User953	do you see something else thats bad in there?
2013-04-18 21:47:55	pfaffle	well, i think what i'd recommend at this point is get a piece of paper out and draw what it's doing hehe
2013-04-18 21:48:09	pfaffle	pictures are very instructive and very helpful
2013-04-18 21:48:37	User953	ok
2013-04-18 21:48:44	pfaffle	like draw a box to represent an object/node, and arrows to represent the pointers and where they point
2013-04-18 21:48:54	pfaffle	should become clear what's going on
2013-04-18 21:50:50	User953	okay
2013-04-18 21:56:59	User953	well i thought i found some errors but i think its worse
2013-04-18 21:57:19	User953	the numbers arent even changing as they should from build_list
2013-04-18 21:57:31	User953	i'll look again
2013-04-18 22:01:11	User953	i don't see any more problems! i fixed a couple things.
2013-04-18 22:01:18	User953	this sucks
2013-04-18 22:01:31	User953	is there something you see that you are hoping i'll find on my own?
2013-04-18 22:02:40	pfaffle	has anything changed in the make_list function?
2013-04-18 22:02:54	pfaffle	you wanna pastie a new version of it to me?
2013-04-18 22:03:07	User953	sure
2013-04-18 22:11:50	pfaffle	i think you're constructing the list correctly now
2013-04-18 22:12:17	pfaffle	so it look slike you fixed that problem
2013-04-18 22:13:54	pfaffle	i'm not sure why the int values aren't changing with each call of the function, if they're class variables like you say in the list class
2013-04-18 22:14:28	pfaffle	i'd have to see more i guess, but i kinda have to run now, sorry
2013-04-18 22:15:11	User953	okay thanks for your help!
2013-04-18 22:15:19	User953	i'm glad i got some stuff fixed!

2013-04-19 20:26:12	User499	i am having a really frustrating time just making my linked list for 163. it shouldnt be this hard.  i've reworked it a bunch of times and checked the book, and it just isn't working.
2013-04-19 20:27:34	Slim	What's the issue you are having?
2013-04-19 20:27:58	Slim	Any specific errors coming back?
2013-04-19 20:28:22	User499	when i try to display the list, it just goes on infinitely
2013-04-19 20:28:34	User499	i don't know why it doesnt end
2013-04-19 20:28:49	Slim	Hm it would help to see your code,
2013-04-19 20:29:08	User499	i can send you my building functions and the display function
2013-04-19 20:29:24	Slim	Sure
2013-04-19 20:29:36	Slim	Want my email or will you use pastbin or something?
2013-04-19 20:29:40	User499	do you want me to use pastie?
2013-04-19 20:29:43	User499	whatever you want
2013-04-19 20:29:47	Slim	that works
2013-04-19 20:30:04	Slim	send me your add and display function :)
2013-04-19 20:31:46	User499	okay should i just send it on here or do you want to do the private chat thing
2013-04-19 20:32:12	Wren	Karla's pretty strict about not making your code public.
2013-04-19 20:32:17	User499	yeah
2013-04-19 20:32:17	Slim	Do you know how to /msg on here?
2013-04-19 20:32:26	Slim	do /msg Slim <link>
2013-04-19 20:32:33	User499	okay
2013-04-19 20:32:38	Slim	Thanks Wren, I forgot about that :)
2013-04-19 20:32:52	User499	yeah she is super strict
2013-04-19 20:33:04	User499	did you get it?
2013-04-19 20:33:13	User499	it didnt show up in my window
2013-04-19 20:33:18	Slim	No I didn't, but you can just email it to maxmarchuK@gmail.com
2013-04-19 20:33:20	Slim	that works too
2013-04-19 20:34:43	Slim	I got it, I'm looking through it now :)
2013-04-19 20:34:56	User499	ok thanks
2013-04-19 20:35:06	User499	the ints are declared in the class fyi
2013-04-19 20:35:18	User499	and ticket is a struct
2013-04-19 20:36:01	Slim	In the while loop in your display functoin, there is an extra parenthese . while(current))
2013-04-19 20:36:28	User499	oh yeah. thats new
2013-04-19 20:36:30	Slim	that's not the issue most likely but just a note
2013-04-19 20:36:41	User499	yeah i was fooling around with that
2013-04-19 20:37:01	Slim	so when you add a new node, do you set the next poitner to null?
2013-04-19 20:37:18	Slim	pointer*
2013-04-19 20:37:54	User499	no i guess i just have it as a new node
2013-04-19 20:39:40	Slim	This is just a linear linked list right?
2013-04-19 20:40:07	User499	yeah
2013-04-19 20:40:16	User499	i dont know why im having such a hard time with this one
2013-04-19 20:40:28	Slim	20:33 < User499> it didnt show up in my window
2013-04-19 20:40:28	Slim	20:33 < Slim> No I didn't, but you can just email it to maxmarchuK@gmail.com
2013-04-19 20:40:28	Slim	20:33 < Slim> that works too
2013-04-19 20:40:36	Slim	Whoops sorry abou tthat
2013-04-19 20:44:01	Slim	So explain to me the process that you link up the node in when you add a new one please, I am having trouble understanding what's going on :)
2013-04-19 20:44:59	Slim	so you create temp, and point it to a new node.
2013-04-19 20:45:14	User499	yeah sorry about all the commented liines. they are other attempts
2013-04-19 20:45:27	Slim	then you copy all of the data into the a_ticket object you created/
2013-04-19 20:45:33	Slim	It's fine! :)
2013-04-19 20:45:34	User499	so i make the new node, now i added a line to set temp -> next = null
2013-04-19 20:45:44	Slim	Alright, dos tha tfix anything?
2013-04-19 20:45:53	User499	nope it still runs forever
2013-04-19 20:45:57	User499	i was hoping!
2013-04-19 20:46:22	User499	so then i set temp -> next = head. hmm that seems weird
2013-04-19 20:46:36	Slim	what happens if ou set the while loop to go while current->next ?
2013-04-19 20:46:40	User499	oh i guess bc head was originally the head
2013-04-19 20:46:54	User499	for the display function?
2013-04-19 20:46:58	Slim	Yeah
2013-04-19 20:47:15	User499	same
2013-04-19 20:47:19	Slim	aw
2013-04-19 20:47:43	Slim	okay, so you copy all of the data into the new ticket
2013-04-19 20:47:46	User499	yeah
2013-04-19 20:47:52	Slim	then you set temp->one_ticket to the new ticket you created
2013-04-19 20:48:10	User499	then i set temp -> next = head, so that it goes in front of the old head pointer
2013-04-19 20:48:12	User499	right
2013-04-19 20:48:13	User499	?
2013-04-19 20:48:15	Slim	then you set temp->next to head?
2013-04-19 20:48:22	User499	yeah
2013-04-19 20:48:36	Slim	Hmm
2013-04-19 20:48:38	User499	it seems weird down in these last few lines
2013-04-19 20:48:59	Slim	When you make a linear linked list, head is usually the first one of the list
2013-04-19 20:49:23	Slim	So what you normally do is make the node, and set it to the last nde in the list
2013-04-19 20:49:30	Slim	I mean, the last node's next pointer* :)
2013-04-19 20:49:50	User499	wait what was that?
2013-04-19 20:50:07	Slim	Are you trying to add the new node to the beginning of the list or the end?
2013-04-19 20:50:12	User499	to the beginning
2013-04-19 20:50:19	Slim	Ah
2013-04-19 20:50:40	Slim	Well then how will you access that node after it is added?
2013-04-19 20:51:01	Slim	normally you would access the new nodes by traversing to the end of the list, starting with head
2013-04-19 20:51:08	User499	then i'd link it back up with the new head
2013-04-19 20:51:23	User499	i had it another way earlier then i looked in the book and it had this. but it seems wonky
2013-04-19 20:51:40	Slim	the new head?
2013-04-19 20:51:47	User499	yeah making a new head
2013-04-19 20:52:17	User499	before, i used the current pointer to try and hold the place in line while temp was made, then linked everything up
2013-04-19 20:52:23	User499	thats what all my commented lines are
2013-04-19 20:52:27	User499	maybe i should go back to that
2013-04-19 20:53:19	Slim	I think what you need to do is create a temp pointer, set it to head, and traverse to the end of the list. Because you're supposed to add to the end of a LLL
2013-04-19 20:53:30	Slim	and then set the new node to temp
2013-04-19 20:53:41	Slim	I mean, temp to the new node :)
2013-04-19 20:53:50	Slim	a LLL usually looks like this:
2013-04-19 20:54:06	Slim	[head]->[node]->[node]->NULL
2013-04-19 20:54:14	Slim	if you had your head at the end, you would have
2013-04-19 20:54:20	User499	yeah i was going to make one of those also
2013-04-19 20:54:31	User499	so that i would have two differently ordered lists
2013-04-19 20:54:31	Slim	[node]->[node]->[head]->NULL
2013-04-19 20:54:36	Slim	and you would lose those nodes
2013-04-19 20:54:39	Slim	before head
2013-04-19 20:55:21	Slim	So your function should look more like ~
2013-04-19 20:55:22	User499	yeah, what i wanted to do was to keep moving head to the front and adding nodes at the front and then replacing head at the top
2013-04-19 20:55:49	Slim	Hmm
2013-04-19 20:55:57	Slim	that's confusing!
2013-04-19 20:56:00	User499	maybe i will just do the normal way of adding at the end and making my for loop different
2013-04-19 20:56:02	User499	yeah
2013-04-19 20:56:11	Slim	yeah that's what I would recommend
2013-04-19 20:56:12	User499	i am so irritated with this dumb assignment
2013-04-19 20:56:19	User499	and the fact that i cant do it
2013-04-19 20:56:20	User499	ha
2013-04-19 20:56:24	Slim	Yeah I know that feeling :(
2013-04-19 20:56:35	Slim	So basically,
2013-04-19 20:56:53	Slim	if no head exists, set head to a new node, do all the copying and stuff, then set head->next to null
2013-04-19 20:57:04	User499	yeah that sounds better
2013-04-19 20:57:16	Slim	if head exists, traverse to the end of the list and add the new node there! :)
2013-04-19 20:58:06	User499	yeah fo sho
2013-04-19 20:58:29	Slim	Cool, good luck with that! Let us know if you need some more help!
2013-04-19 20:58:30	User499	i'm frustrated because i know we did this other way in 162 lab and in class, and now i can't do it anymore!
2013-04-19 20:58:42	User499	will you still be online tonight?
2013-04-19 20:58:49	Slim	I'll be online for another hour or so :)
2013-04-19 20:59:09	User499	okay well i'll hopefully get some progress and let you know if i get stuck elsewhere

2013-04-22 14:15:35	User872	I was out of town last week an need help with my lab #2 for cs163
2013-04-22 14:15:58	User872	i am creating a constructor in a .cpp file but getting errors that I am missing ';'
2013-04-22 14:16:07	User872	is there a place I can post the code to show you?
2013-04-22 14:17:04	zaalatta	User872: Are you working with classes?
2013-04-22 14:17:54	User872	yes
2013-04-22 14:18:21	zaalatta	Did you remember to put a ; at the end of your class after the closing '}'?
2013-04-22 14:19:10	User872	yup
2013-04-22 14:19:44	User872	my constructor looks like this: list::list() { head = NULL; }
2013-04-22 14:19:55	User872	isnt that the correct syntax?
2013-04-22 14:20:17	zaalatta	Hrm, that looks right
2013-04-22 14:20:26	zaalatta	Did the error message indicate a line number?
2013-04-22 14:20:48	User872	yeah, it indicates the line right that i call my constructor
2013-04-22 14:20:59	zaalatta	And I assume you checked that line?
2013-04-22 14:21:24	User872	yup
2013-04-22 14:22:06	User872	i get the error in vim and dev c++ so i must be missing something
2013-04-22 14:22:21	zaalatta	Could you send a snippet of you code to zaalatta@cat.pdx.edu?
2013-04-22 14:22:34	User872	sure
2013-04-22 14:22:44	zaalatta	Thanks
2013-04-22 14:22:55	User872	i also get an error that list doesnt exsist... so there maybe something else going on
2013-04-22 14:23:21	zaalatta	Did you #include your .h file?
2013-04-22 14:24:03	User872	yup ill paste my code
2013-04-22 14:24:06	User872	and send it to u
2013-04-22 14:24:16	zaalatta	Alrightie, thanks
2013-04-22 14:24:41	zaalatta	I might have to run soon but someone should be helping you out
2013-04-22 14:26:06	zaalatta	Could you also include the error message please?
2013-04-22 14:26:33	User872	sent
2013-04-22 14:27:17	zaalatta	Got it
2013-04-22 14:27:21	zaalatta	One sec while I read it over
2013-04-22 14:29:18	zaalatta	Okay, well a few things I notice right off the bat:
2013-04-22 14:29:37	zaalatta	1) Your implementation for the functions of your classes shouldn't be inside main
2013-04-22 14:30:00	User872	ok
2013-04-22 14:30:13	zaalatta	I would recommend writing them out in a separately defined .cpp file
2013-04-22 14:31:21	zaalatta	Because what you're essentially doing is trying to call the 'list()' constructor from main
2013-04-22 14:32:02	User872	gotcha. so when the constructor is invoked will to work even if its called from a different .cpp file?
2013-04-22 14:32:42	zaalatta	You shouldn't expressly call your constructor, it will do it implicitly
2013-04-22 14:32:55	zaalatta	when you define a new object of that class
2013-04-22 14:35:40	zaalatta	i gotta run but someone will be assisting you shortly
2013-04-22 14:36:34	+alevar	User872: I'll be taking care of this. zaalatta is sending me a copy of your code.
2013-04-22 14:38:12	User872	thanks!
2013-04-22 14:38:43	User872	ok Zaalatta was saying i should put the constructor into a seperate .cpp file
2013-04-22 14:39:42	User872	why couldnt i just put it in main.cpp and if the classes are defined in the .h files, would there be anything else in the .cpp other than my constructor and deconstructors?
2013-04-22 14:40:34	+alevar	Karla wants you to get practice separating out files.
2013-04-22 14:40:49	+alevar	Enormous monolithic files can be difficult to understand.
2013-04-22 14:41:46	User872	ok. in vim is there a way to create a new window for editing?
2013-04-22 14:41:47	+alevar	I think the errors are coming from the function implementations being inside of main() { ... }
2013-04-22 14:41:54	+alevar	:tabopen <file name>
2013-04-22 14:42:13	+alevar	IIRC, to switch between them use :tabnext
2013-04-22 14:43:48	User872	hmmm that didnt work. how do i close a tab?
2013-04-22 14:43:53	User872	:tabclose filename?
2013-04-22 14:44:30	+alevar	I think just :q
2013-04-22 14:44:45	Slim	if you want to split the screen into two different files you can type :vsplit filename and you can switch between the windows with ctrl+w
2013-04-22 14:45:12	+alevar	Oh, it's tabedit
2013-04-22 14:45:15	+alevar	not tabopen
2013-04-22 14:49:24	User872	god vim is cool
2013-04-22 14:49:37	User872	ok ... ill work on the .cpp files
2013-04-22 14:50:34	+alevar	vim++
2013-04-22 14:51:03	User872	in my new .cpp file that I will be putting my constructor into. I need to include my .h file again right?
2013-04-22 14:53:50	User872	ok got that working.
2013-04-22 14:54:15	User872	So can you clairify something for me?
2013-04-22 14:54:39	User872	I have a journal.h list.h main.cpp and now a lab2.cpp
2013-04-22 14:55:03	User872	would only my constructors and deconstructors go into the lab2.cpp
2013-04-22 14:55:23	User872	becuase the class members are going to be called from main.
2013-04-22 14:55:43	User872	i guess my function definitions would go into the lab2.cpp as well
2013-04-22 14:59:40	+rueckerc	if you have a journal.h and list.h I would think there would be journal.cpp and list.cpp to implement all the class member functions prototyped in those headers
2013-04-22 15:01:42	+rueckerc	and yes, you will need to include .h files in each cpp
2013-04-22 15:04:18	User872	ugh 162 is finally starting to come back to me
2013-04-22 15:07:11	User872	ok I am supposed to implement a add function. I cant remember how to create the first element of a LLL. I am passing a class in by reference called entry. can you get me going on the right track?
2013-04-22 15:08:02	User872	so add looks like this: int add( journal & entry)
2013-04-22 15:09:05	User872	would it be something like head.entry?
2013-04-22 15:10:12	User872	nevermind. I remember (ish) now
2013-04-22 15:24:56	User872	does this look right?

2013-04-22 15:37:09	User872	since int add() is a member function shouldnt it have access to head?
2013-04-22 15:37:26	+alevar	Did you say int list::add() ?
2013-04-22 15:37:42	+alevar	int list::add() { ... implementation ... }
2013-04-22 15:42:16	User872	that was it thanks!
2013-04-22 15:43:55	+alevar	I've seen that mistake many times, mostly in my own code.
2013-04-22 17:00:36	User872	is there a write all windows command in vim?
2013-04-22 17:23:52	User872	are there any tutors still online?
2013-04-22 17:24:17	Slim	There should be
2013-04-22 17:24:24	Slim	What do you mean by write all windows?
2013-04-22 17:24:47	User872	in vim you can split the windows and work on multiple files at once.
2013-04-22 17:25:20	Slim	So you want to be able to see all the files while editing tem?
2013-04-22 17:25:22	User872	I was wondering if you can write all to memory in a single command, rather than selecting each window and writing out one at a time
2013-04-22 17:25:35	Slim	Ohhh
2013-04-22 17:25:45	Slim	try :wa!
2013-04-22 17:25:49	drbop	:wall
2013-04-22 17:25:54	drbop	That is the command.
2013-04-22 17:26:05	User872	bam! :wall did it
2013-04-22 17:26:06	User872	thanks
2013-04-22 17:26:12	Slim	nice drbop++
2013-04-22 17:27:09	Slim	does :wa work as well?
2013-04-22 17:30:52	drbop	Yeah, that works as well.
2013-04-22 17:31:06	User872	well :wa doesnt error, but it also doesnt say it wrote out to the file
2013-04-22 17:34:03	drbop	Which computer are you on?  I tried the command on various computers, which had varying levels of output, but all still wrote to the files.
2013-04-22 17:36:59	User872	chandra
2013-04-22 17:38:20	drbop	I believe it still works there.  If there have been no changes made to the files, it won't actually write since it doesn't need to.  That might be what's happening.

2013-04-23 10:53:47	User759	it's being altered first in the list function, but when the list function is called, its repeating the alteration. how can i make it so that the value is only changed once?

2013-04-23 11:14:11	User759	ok
2013-04-23 11:17:52	@krinkle	User759: in guest::res_seat you are calling search_sect twice, once in the if() and once in the else if(). If the if() part doesn't evaluate to true, it reruns the search_sect in the else if() to try again.
2013-04-23 11:18:25	@krinkle	You could fix this by storing the result of the_list.search_sect() in a variable and then using if() and else if() to check the value of the variable
2013-04-23 11:19:41	User759	okay i'll try it out.
2013-04-23 11:19:42	User759	thanks

2013-04-24 21:47:07	MrBlue	Does anyone know a good way to make Vim show me both my .h file and my .cpp file at the same time?
2013-04-24 21:47:10	MrBlue	Tabs suck
2013-04-24 21:48:10	Wren	MrBlue: You can use a split screen
2013-04-24 21:48:33	MrBlue	Wren:so just run vim twice?
2013-04-24 21:48:51	Wren	No. See the bottom of this page: http://www.worldtimzone.com/res/vi.html
2013-04-24 21:49:27	Wren	Basically, ctrl-wv will split windows vertically, and ctrl-ww will cycle between windows.
2013-04-24 21:49:38	MrBlue	That is EXACTLY what I needed, thank you.
2013-04-24 21:50:02	Wren	From the command line you can type vim -O file1 file2 file3 etc to open them in vertical split mode.
2013-04-24 21:51:12	MrBlue	the vim command line, or the other one?
2013-04-24 21:52:55	Wren	The shell command line
2013-04-24 21:53:06	Wren	So bash, zsh, etc.
2013-04-24 21:53:11	MrBlue	ok, awesome.
2013-04-24 21:55:32	MrBlue	Anytime I use the split window command my putty crashes...
2013-04-24 21:55:34	MaddHatter	ctrl-w,s to split horizontally
2013-04-24 21:56:01	Wren	putty crashes? That's sure weird.
2013-04-24 21:56:10	MrBlue	Am I doing it wrong?
2013-04-24 21:56:32	Wren	Doubt it. Not sure what the deal is though.
2013-04-24 21:56:41	MaddHatter	I do all kinds of splitting and tabbing in vim. And I've never gotten putty to crash no matter what I do.
2013-04-24 21:56:55	MrBlue	I am the master crasher, fear me!
2013-04-24 21:57:23	Wren	How could the remote shell cause PuTTy to crash anyway?
2013-04-24 21:57:41	Wren	Maybe putty is choking on some line-drawing character?
2013-04-24 21:58:11	MaddHatter	the remote shell can request to change the terminal window title, and putty will honor this. And if that request has something invalid in it....? I don't know.
2013-04-24 21:58:22	MrBlue	I think I was typing a command that vim didn't understand.
2013-04-24 21:58:29	MrBlue	It was vim, not putty.
2013-04-24 21:58:38	Wren	oh, ok.
2013-04-24 21:58:49	MrBlue	I fixed it.
2013-04-24 21:58:55	Wren	goodgood
2013-04-24 21:59:02	MrBlue	I was keeping ctr down for the second character of each command.
2013-04-24 21:59:51	Wren	That doesn't cause me any problems. Hmm.
2013-04-24 22:00:29	MrBlue	I got it working, that's what's important, right?
2013-04-24 22:00:45	Wren	heh, sure.
2013-04-24 22:00:51	Wren	I'm just curious.
2013-04-24 22:01:36	MrBlue	You are free to to prod my computer if you like whenever I'm in the tutor lounge.

2013-04-25 00:39:14	jbyuhas	it's weird, i get a segfault if i do that, but if i call individual functions to set the initializers it works fine
2013-04-25 00:45:59	jbyuhas	sigh.... i was passing a null char pointer into strlen, time to go to sleep

2013-04-25 20:11:53	User167	if i have a pointer to a new class called A and I want to pass it into a function of my list class. would the syntax be:
2013-04-25 20:12:59	User167	<list name>->list.function(A)
2013-04-25 20:15:23	Wren	It should just be <list_name>->function(A)
2013-04-25 20:15:33	Wren	Assuming function expects a pointer.
2013-04-25 20:16:08	Wren	If it expects an actual object you will need to dereference it with *A
2013-04-25 20:16:24	Wren	But I would wait around for a second opinion, my C++ is a little rusty
2013-04-25 20:23:20	User167	well that went from 1 error to like 20, so at least we know its on the right track (compiler went further)

2013-04-29 00:06:18	Wren	MrRed: ^^
2013-04-29 00:07:03	MrRed	I'm getting a segmentation fault in my code.
2013-04-29 00:07:25	MrRed	I think it's because I don't delete my memory at the end, but I don't know if that's it.
2013-04-29 00:07:38	MrRed	Also, the only memory allocated is a class and I don't know how to delete them.
2013-04-29 00:08:25	MrRed	I wrote it a deconstructor but it is not a pointer.
2013-04-29 00:08:42	MrRed	Help?
2013-04-29 00:09:43	Racoon	what class is this for?
2013-04-29 00:10:24	MrRed	It's for program 1 of 163
2013-04-29 00:10:29	Racoon	you wanna pm me a link to your .h file for the class via pastebin
2013-04-29 00:10:33	MrRed	It's about making tickets to sell.
2013-04-29 00:11:37	Racoon	yeah thats a fun one
2013-04-29 00:12:10	Racoon	http://pastebin.com/ paste your .h code and maybe i can throw some hints back at you
2013-04-29 00:12:17	MrRed	http://pastebin.com/YaWfz9SU
2013-04-29 00:12:22	MrRed	Is that how do?
2013-04-29 00:13:05	Racoon	gimme a sec to check it out
2013-04-29 00:13:23	MrRed	I just wasn't sure I did pastebin right.
2013-04-29 00:13:26	Racoon	and find a bikelock for my roomate :p
2013-04-29 00:13:32	Racoon	looks good
2013-04-29 00:13:34	MrRed	A noble quest.
2013-04-29 00:15:12	Racoon	mkay, now that that is handled lets walk through this a bit
2013-04-29 00:16:18	MrRed	Go for it.
2013-04-29 00:16:45	Racoon	when i get a seg fault i always go to arrays and pointers first
2013-04-29 00:17:41	Racoon	you only have LLL data in the class
2013-04-29 00:17:47	MrRed	Yeah...
2013-04-29 00:17:53	MrRed	It's pretty much a front for an LLL
2013-04-29 00:17:56	Racoon	does it happen when traversing the LLL?
2013-04-29 00:18:24	MrRed	It happens when I run the code.
2013-04-29 00:18:34	MrRed	I could put markers between bits to see when it is.
2013-04-29 00:18:35	MrRed	Just a sec.
2013-04-29 00:18:47	Racoon	noice okay you should pastebin your best assumtion
2013-04-29 00:19:05	Racoon	typically this happens when dereferencing a null/junk pointer
2013-04-29 00:19:31	Racoon	also I'm curious about this int * seats line in your section struct
2013-04-29 00:20:10	Racoon	I wonder at how you treat that
2013-04-29 00:20:16	Racoon	in your code
2013-04-29 00:20:29	Racoon	why a pointer?
2013-04-29 00:21:21	MrRed	I honestly don't know why.
2013-04-29 00:21:27	MrRed	I wrote most of this when really tired.
2013-04-29 00:21:34	MrRed	I was trying to go with the spirit of the assignment.
2013-04-29 00:21:52	MrRed	I don't have any dynamically allocated anything and I thought it might be somehting we were graded on.
2013-04-29 00:22:31	MrRed	It did, in fact, happen as soon as I tried to traverse.
2013-04-29 00:23:57	Racoon	mkay, and are you traversing using a while loop?
2013-04-29 00:24:08	Racoon	or some looping construct?
2013-04-29 00:24:49	Racoon	and what is the condition (the statement in the parens) you use to loop?
2013-04-29 00:24:59	MrRed	Yeah, I am.
2013-04-29 00:25:10	MrRed	While current.
2013-04-29 00:26:06	Racoon	throw that section up on pastebin for me
2013-04-29 00:28:16	MrRed	http://pastebin.com/qEXQiqSm
2013-04-29 00:29:13	 *	Racoon proceeds to analyze
2013-04-29 00:33:09	Racoon	mkay first thing to catch my eye was this : node*current = new node;
2013-04-29 00:34:05	MrRed	What's wrong with that?
2013-04-29 00:34:09	Racoon	you are allocating new nodes and then immediately discarding that information into oblivion when you do :current = previous = head;
2013-04-29 00:34:27	Racoon	well everytime you call 'new' you allocate space
2013-04-29 00:35:05	Racoon	the current pointer isnt meant to hold a new node so much as it intends to point to the node that you already have
2013-04-29 00:35:30	MrRed	So should I just make the nodes and not make them pointers first?
2013-04-29 00:35:53	Racoon	well the node you make is called temp
2013-04-29 00:36:01	Racoon	and temp holds your new data
2013-04-29 00:36:14	Racoon	current shoud just be a raw pointer
2013-04-29 00:36:20	Racoon	node * current;
2013-04-29 00:36:31	MrRed	got it.
2013-04-29 00:36:38	Racoon	same with previous
2013-04-29 00:36:51	MrRed	Those should just be pointers, not new nodes.
2013-04-29 00:36:59	Racoon	right
2013-04-29 00:37:04	MrRed	Oh, right, because they're just going to point at head and stuff anyway.
2013-04-29 00:37:06	Racoon	they are tools for traversal
2013-04-29 00:37:16	Racoon	edzachary
2013-04-29 00:38:30	Racoon	also this: while(current->seats.price>temp->seats.price && current)
2013-04-29 00:38:50	MrRed	edzachary?
2013-04-29 00:39:05	MrRed	And is that bad just because of spacing?
2013-04-29 00:39:11	Racoon	(exactly said in my fathers words)
2013-04-29 00:39:37	MrRed	I see.
2013-04-29 00:39:39	Racoon	well if current is null, you cant access seats
2013-04-29 00:40:59	MrRed	Isn't that handled by the if(!head) before that?
2013-04-29 00:41:42	Racoon	well lets say you have a list with one element
2013-04-29 00:41:42	MrRed	or should I put current first?
2013-04-29 00:41:48	MrRed	Is that the fix?
2013-04-29 00:41:51	Racoon	head isnt null
2013-04-29 00:42:07	Racoon	that might work
2013-04-29 00:42:21	MrRed	In that boolean, should current go first so it checks that first and it won't try to dereference a NULL pointer?
2013-04-29 00:42:28	Racoon	some languages will stop evaluating the condition sometimes if the answer is immediate
2013-04-29 00:43:01	Racoon	i think c++ does that
2013-04-29 00:43:06	MrRed	I think so...
2013-04-29 00:43:38	MrRed	I just can't remember if it goes the other way.
2013-04-29 00:43:45	MrRed	It might read left to right or right to left.
2013-04-29 00:43:50	MrRed	Karla talked about this..
2013-04-29 00:43:55	Racoon	try it out, Ill google

2013-04-29 00:45:39	Racoon	its called "short-circuit" operators
2013-04-29 00:46:31	MrPurple	So it does read left to right.
2013-04-29 00:46:39	Racoon	for instance (False && anything_else) is false immediately regardless of what anything_else is
2013-04-29 00:46:55	MrPurple	Right, and it won't even evaluate anything_else
2013-04-29 00:47:02	Racoon	so cool
2013-04-29 00:48:17	Racoon	give that a shot and keep me posted, I got to go check on food real quick
2013-04-29 00:48:31	MrPurple	It got way farther!
2013-04-29 00:48:39	MrPurple	WAY farther, like it DID something!
2013-04-29 00:48:49	MrPurple	I think I just need to go back and finish making those revisions to the other code.

2013-04-29 01:19:50	Racoon	do you know where it may be seg faulting?
2013-04-29 01:20:09	MrPurple	It's seg faulting in a specific function.
2013-04-29 01:20:26	MrPurple	I don't know where more exactly...

2013-04-29 01:42:40	Racoon	 mkay im back
2013-04-29 01:42:47	Racoon	checking it out
2013-04-29 01:45:00	MrPurple	Did you find anything?
2013-04-29 01:46:09	Racoon	okay so i have a couple of suggestions
2013-04-29 01:47:35	Racoon	if you follow through the code, check out what happens when you have one object in your list
2013-04-29 01:47:58	Racoon	you jump over the if statement, and hit the counter
2013-04-29 01:48:09	Racoon	it counts to one and saves it to number
2013-04-29 01:48:40	Racoon	then you hit the while loop, you say (number >=0)
2013-04-29 01:49:16	Racoon	so then you hit the for loop and progress curent fom the onject node to its next pointer
2013-04-29 01:49:23	Racoon	which would be null
2013-04-29 01:49:46	MrPurple	So it tries to progress too far.
2013-04-29 01:50:00	MrPurple	Could I fix that by just making it >0 instead of 0?
2013-04-29 01:52:05	Racoon	the while loop is counting through the indexes of the list
2013-04-29 01:52:36	Racoon	its also executing when number is zero
2013-04-29 01:52:55	Racoon	which should mean there is nothing in the list,
2013-04-29 01:53:16	Racoon	your for loop is the seg fault culprit
2013-04-29 01:53:48	Racoon	hes looping into a null pointer
2013-04-29 01:53:55	Racoon	index = 1
2013-04-29 02:01:28	Racoon	I got to go to bed, but the key is to make sure you don't dereference any null pointers
2013-04-29 02:02:39	MrPurple	ok, thank you!
2013-04-29 02:03:21	Racoon	have fun!

2013-05-02 22:43:49	User944	i have a question about my matrix for cs201
2013-05-02 22:44:29	User944	not as much about the code, but theoretically
2013-05-02 22:49:29	User944	we have to find the sum of our matrix in different ways. first, going through by columns first, then by rows first, then by rows first but with indices  reversed. he is suggesting that these sums will not all be the same.
2013-05-02 22:49:49	User944	oh nevermind. shoot
2013-05-02 22:49:56	User944	i misread the assignment!
2013-05-02 22:50:01	User944	idiot
2013-05-02 22:53:42	zaalatta	User944: glad to see I'm not the only one doing this assignment last minute :)
2013-05-02 22:55:37	User944	hah yeah
2013-05-02 22:55:41	User944	its stupid
2013-05-02 22:55:56	User944	and his directions are stupid long
2013-05-02 22:57:45	zaalatta	Yep, it's not that hard if only he didn't want us to explain time differences and stuff :(
2013-05-02 22:58:58	User944	yeah i've put that last part off for like an hour now
2013-05-02 22:59:27	User944	i just don't care why the times are different!
2013-05-02 23:00:47	zaalatta	Same :/

2013-05-02 23:15:59	pfaffle	you will be talking a lot about how times are different and stuff
2013-05-02 23:16:17	User944	i won't be there, luckily

2013-05-02 23:16:19	User944	i'm comp e
2013-05-02 23:16:31	User944	i have a quick question though
2013-05-02 23:16:39	zaalatta	Shoot
2013-05-02 23:16:49	User944	what's total system time, and real time
2013-05-02 23:16:54	User944	i guess i could just look it up
2013-05-02 23:17:07	zaalatta	Is that for "time" on the command line?
2013-05-02 23:17:23	pfaffle	not sure, but i'm guessing that system time is how much time it's spent on the CPU running
2013-05-02 23:17:29	User944	yeah they are outputs from that
2013-05-02 23:17:50	User944	the 'time' command gives real time, system time and user time
2013-05-02 23:17:54	pfaffle	oh
2013-05-02 23:18:07	User944	real time is the longest on mine
2013-05-02 23:18:11	User944	i guess i should look them up
2013-05-02 23:18:35	pfaffle	system time is how long it's spent in superuser mode
2013-05-02 23:18:49	pfaffle	i.e. if you're making system calls and such which require the kernel to do things
2013-05-02 23:19:13	User944	whoa! superuser mode
2013-05-02 23:19:16	User944	sounds extreme
2013-05-02 23:19:26	pfaffle	heh yeah
2013-05-02 23:19:33	sabreman	im also working on this lol
2013-05-02 23:19:38	User944	oh ahah
2013-05-02 23:19:40	sabreman	but im haivng a strange thing happen
2013-05-02 23:19:46	pfaffle	things like accessing hardware require elevated privileges which means going through the OS to do it
2013-05-02 23:19:54	pfaffle	your program doesn't get direct access
2013-05-02 23:19:58	sabreman	Im running it on a vm, and afgter the first exectuion, everything happens super fast
2013-05-02 23:20:03	sabreman	like it takes less then a second to sum
2013-05-02 23:20:08	sabreman	and like 1.4 seconds to copy/transpose
2013-05-02 23:20:15	sabreman	the first time i ran teh code while testing though
2013-05-02 23:20:25	sabreman	summing took lik 15s, and copy/transpose nearly 30
2013-05-02 23:20:51	sabreman	i have no idea what's happeneing
2013-05-02 23:20:52	User944	do you have the full matrix size?
2013-05-02 23:20:55	sabreman	yea
2013-05-02 23:21:03	sabreman	could my host machine be physicly caching it?
2013-05-02 23:21:05	User944	mine takes a long time to do everything
2013-05-02 23:21:16	zaalatta	sabreman: That's what I was thinking - cache
2013-05-02 23:21:22	sabreman	hmm
2013-05-02 23:21:30	sabreman	rebooting the vm didnt solve it.
2013-05-02 23:21:30	zaalatta	yeah, mine takes ~20 seconds to do each step
2013-05-02 23:21:37	sabreman	I'll try reboting host and see if that helps
2013-05-02 23:21:38	User944	mines at like 30
2013-05-02 23:21:42	sabreman	brb
2013-05-02 23:21:50	User944	i wonder if its bc i have so many apps open hah
2013-05-02 23:22:06	zaalatta	Are you on cs.pdx.edu?
2013-05-02 23:22:09	User944	yeah
2013-05-02 23:22:27	User944	probably shouldnt matter what my computer has
2013-05-02 23:22:29	zaalatta	Not sure if your apps will affect it then cuz it's a different computer
2013-05-02 23:22:38	User944	yeah that makes sense
2013-05-02 23:22:48	User944	my program probably just sucks
2013-05-02 23:22:54	User944	even though he gave us almost everything
2013-05-02 23:23:11	User944	did you use ints for the sums?
2013-05-02 23:23:21	zaalatta	Yeah, but they came out weird
2013-05-02 23:23:26	zaalatta	Got negative numbers...
2013-05-02 23:23:43	User944	yeah i got that. i think its overflow. i ended up making mine long long
2013-05-02 23:23:45	sabreman	also guys
2013-05-02 23:23:51	sabreman	this sint due till 10am tommorw
2013-05-02 23:23:55	sabreman	so stil ltons of time fyi
2013-05-02 23:24:08	zaalatta	But what about sleep?
2013-05-02 23:24:36	User944	i thought about going to bed. but realistically im not going to get myself up before i absolutely have to
2013-05-02 23:25:02	zaalatta	Hmm... I'm gonna try long long
2013-05-02 23:25:12	User944	i still can't get the full 15000
2013-05-02 23:25:18	sabreman	use unsigned int for the sum
2013-05-02 23:25:19	User944	but i got up to like 13000
2013-05-02 23:25:29	sabreman	use ulimit -s unlimited
2013-05-02 23:25:34	sabreman	that'll let you do the full
2013-05-02 23:25:36	zaalatta	I tried unsigned but I got an error
2013-05-02 23:25:41	User944	yeah i did that ulimit
2013-05-02 23:25:45	sabreman	also the restart helped
2013-05-02 23:25:50	zaalatta	I also did the ulimit thing
2013-05-02 23:25:51	sabreman	but my times are still rediculosly low
2013-05-02 23:26:00	sabreman	8.2 for transpose
2013-05-02 23:26:06	zaalatta	Whatever, embrace it
2013-05-02 23:26:07	sabreman	<1.8 for summing
2013-05-02 23:26:14	User944	overachiever
2013-05-02 23:26:15	sabreman	i dont wann explain it though D:
2013-05-02 23:26:16	zaalatta	You probably just have a good computer
2013-05-02 23:26:25	sabreman	but that's the thing
2013-05-02 23:26:30	sabreman	the first time it ran it was like 30 something
2013-05-02 23:26:43	sabreman	is ther any way to reset teh caches fully?
2013-05-02 23:26:49	sabreman	like would a hard-reset do?
2013-05-02 23:27:17	zaalatta	Idk about resetting caches
2013-05-02 23:27:23	User944	me neither
2013-05-02 23:28:12	sabreman	where are all the smart people when you need them
2013-05-02 23:28:14	sabreman	D:
2013-05-02 23:28:18	User944	how long are your "sum of all matrix elements"
2013-05-02 23:28:27	User944	mine is way longer than his example
2013-05-02 23:28:35	sabreman	.79, 1.2, 1.7
2013-05-02 23:28:46	sabreman	well
2013-05-02 23:28:49	sabreman	ima try something
2013-05-02 23:29:02	zaalatta	Mine are about the same as his
2013-05-02 23:29:44	User944	did you just do the same line for the sum in your matrix creator as he gave?
2013-05-02 23:30:00	User944	i've tried different variations but its just huge
2013-05-02 23:30:02	zaalatta	Yeah, I used his examples
2013-05-02 23:30:39	User944	and you said like sum = a[m][n] or whatever in your initial summation?
2013-05-02 23:30:56	bowzr	does anyone in CS201 understand why these simulations take different times?
2013-05-02 23:31:16	sabreman	man
2013-05-02 23:31:23	sabreman	my guess:
2013-05-02 23:31:23	User944	i'm going to look it up
2013-05-02 23:31:34	sabreman	caching, cpu power, ram
2013-05-02 23:31:37	sabreman	in that order
2013-05-02 23:31:44	sabreman	i jsut knoced the amount of cpu my vm cna use
2013-05-02 23:31:47	sabreman	form 100% to 40
2013-05-02 23:32:01	sabreman	and it bascily doubled my times
2013-05-02 23:32:06	sabreman	to like ~2s per sum
2013-05-02 23:32:12	sabreman	and like 15-17 for copy/transpose
2013-05-02 23:32:37	sabreman	Oh well, w/e. I dont care enough anymore. I'm jsut gonna do a bs writeup on this.
2013-05-02 23:32:50	bowzr	but the cpu or ram wouldnt change between one simulation and another, would it?
2013-05-02 23:32:59	zaalatta	User944: I used sum += a[m][n]
2013-05-02 23:33:21	sabreman	but it would caceh
2013-05-02 23:33:24	sabreman	like
2013-05-02 23:33:28	sabreman	the very first time i ran it
2013-05-02 23:33:36	sabreman	it took >30 seconds to do the transpose
2013-05-02 23:33:44	User944	yeah that's what i meant. my bad
2013-05-02 23:33:45	sabreman	even after rebbot it was dast
2013-05-02 23:34:11	sabreman	if i knew of a shure fire way to clear my caches, i'd do it and run it agian
2013-05-02 23:34:15	sabreman	but i ahve no clue
2013-05-02 23:42:39	bowzr	sigh i have got to start working on these assignments earlier...
2013-05-02 23:52:09	User944	if it makes you feel better, i did my hw2 way early, then lost a bunch of points bc i forgot to do a section. so it's probably just as well to do it the night before
2013-05-02 23:54:15	zaalatta	I hate that it's due by the start of class
2013-05-02 23:54:25	zaalatta	It would be so much better if we had all Friday to do it
2013-05-02 23:54:47	User944	does anyone know what his midterms are like
2013-05-02 23:55:06	zaalatta	Nope, I'm actually kinda concerned about that
2013-05-02 23:55:09	User944	me too
2013-05-02 23:55:32	zaalatta	Like it feels like there's a lot of nit-picky material and I can't imagine that he'd want to test us on it all
2013-05-02 23:55:39	User944	especially after that one guy had the answer to the sample question in like a second
2013-05-02 23:55:59	User944	im hoping it will be general short answer stuff
2013-05-02 23:56:22	zaalatta	Yeah, me too
2013-05-02 23:56:37	zaalatta	I really need to get my butt in gear and do some studying for this class
2013-05-02 23:57:06	sabreman	from what i've heard
2013-05-02 23:57:10	sabreman	it's open note and open book
2013-05-02 23:57:21	User944	oh really?
2013-05-02 23:57:24	User944	shazam
2013-05-02 23:57:35	sabreman	also i;m kinda warried to.
2013-05-02 23:57:42	zaalatta	That's not necessarily a good thing though
2013-05-02 23:57:53	sabreman	this feels like a class that would have jsut a ton of trick and difficult questions ont eh test
2013-05-02 23:58:05	zaalatta	Yeah
2013-05-02 23:58:33	User944	yeah probably
2013-05-02 23:58:48	User944	did you guys go to the make up class
2013-05-02 23:58:54	zaalatta	I did
2013-05-02 23:59:01	User944	was it just more of the same
2013-05-02 23:59:17	zaalatta	Yeah, basically
2013-05-02 23:59:27	zaalatta	He kinda just went over the parameter passing stuff
2013-05-02 23:59:38	zaalatta	Essentially gave us the answers to the homework
2013-05-02 23:59:54	User944	oh
2013-05-03 00:00:13	User944	its weird how his hws dont really match up with lecture at all
2013-05-03 00:00:22	User944	unless theres a magical connection that i'm missing
2013-05-03 00:00:49	sabreman	good mornign everyone
2013-05-03 00:00:52	sabreman	it's friday!
2013-05-03 00:00:54	sabreman	yay
2013-05-03 00:00:58	User944	yuck
2013-05-03 00:01:11	User944	i have a test on saturday for karla
2013-05-03 00:01:27	sabreman	II find it silly how he basicly jsut gives us the anwsers to his hw in his slides and assingment docs
2013-05-03 00:01:31	zaalatta	Oh Karla's exams are no big deal
2013-05-03 00:01:34	sabreman	yea
2013-05-03 00:01:35	zaalatta	You'll do great
2013-05-03 00:01:41	User944	pffft maybe for you
2013-05-03 00:01:52	User944	i got b's on everything almost for her in 162
2013-05-03 00:01:57	User944	it was depressing
2013-05-03 00:02:21	User944	she just kept writing SEG FAULT all over my pages hahahah
2013-05-03 00:02:22	sabreman	Man this class scares me
2013-05-03 00:02:35	sabreman	I'm doing so well on the hw, i just KNOW i'll screw up the midterm
2013-05-03 00:02:38	sabreman	D:
2013-05-03 00:02:39	zaalatta	Haha, I got some of those seg faults too
2013-05-03 00:02:45	zaalatta	sabreman: same
2013-05-03 00:03:02	zaalatta	I usually do well on hw but crappy on exams
2013-05-03 00:03:07	sabreman	what part of the grade are the tsts btw?
2013-05-03 00:03:18	zaalatta	no idea
2013-05-03 00:03:33	User944	tests are 200 pts each
2013-05-03 00:03:37	User944	hws are 120 each
2013-05-03 00:04:06	sabreman	oh dam
2013-05-03 00:04:10	sabreman	that's not bad at all
2013-05-03 00:04:15	User944	yeah
2013-05-03 00:04:27	sabreman	that measn if i totaly fuck up the midterms
2013-05-03 00:04:31	sabreman	i can still get an easy c
2013-05-03 00:04:34	sabreman	and final
2013-05-03 00:04:36	sabreman	yay
2013-05-03 00:04:46	User944	2.0 and go
2013-05-03 00:04:59	User944	that's my dad's motto
2013-05-03 00:05:03	sabreman	lul
2013-05-03 00:05:09	sabreman	im not shooting for a c
2013-05-03 00:05:18	sabreman	but it's good to know that it wil be REALLY hard to do worse
2013-05-03 00:05:31	sabreman	so i'm probably looking at a b for this class
2013-05-03 00:05:34	User944	haha me neither. but its sort of a sad funny idea
2013-05-03 00:10:43	sabreman	um
2013-05-03 00:12:01	sabreman	nvm
2013-05-03 00:12:07	sabreman	wel good night
2013-05-03 00:12:10	sabreman	im off
2013-05-03 00:12:42	User944	night

2013-05-06 17:29:26	User998	i'm having issues getting my 163 assignment going
2013-05-06 17:30:33	User998	i'm just trying to create my list of customers in the queue, but when i try to compile it says that my object of 'guest' type isn't defined.
2013-05-06 17:31:20	User998	i have a guest struct which has a person's info, then i have my queue class, and a node struct which has a dynamically allocated array of 'guest' objects
2013-05-06 17:31:52	User998	then in main i prompt the user for their info, and i store it in main's guest object
2013-05-06 17:32:36	+askore	User998: is the 'guest' object type defined correctly in your header file?
2013-05-06 17:32:47	User998	i'm trying to access that in my enqueue function, but it's not working. i'm not sure if i need to pass in guest as an arg, or if i can just call it
2013-05-06 17:33:34	User998	i think it is
2013-05-06 17:33:55	User998	i only have one guest object type in my node struct
2013-05-06 17:34:01	User998	guest * info
2013-05-06 17:35:15	+askore	so if you had a node called "node * temp", you are accessing the guest in that node by doing "temp->info"?
2013-05-06 17:36:14	User998	well i had tried that earlier, then i changed it
2013-05-06 17:36:18	User998	i have it in now.
2013-05-06 17:36:37	User998	i don't need to pass in guest a_guest as ar argument right?
2013-05-06 17:36:43	User998	since a struct is public?
2013-05-06 17:36:58	+askore	that sounds right, yes
2013-05-06 17:37:15	User998	ok thanks
2013-05-06 17:39:07	User998	but i do need a pointer to the guest object when i make my display function right?
2013-05-06 17:39:43	+askore	hmm, you should be able to access it the same way you do in the enqueue function, if they're in the same class
2013-05-06 17:40:08	User998	okay
2013-05-06 17:42:23	User998	on another note, i'm stuck on my recursion practice. i've written a couple of functions but they don't work, and i can't understand what i have wrong
2013-05-06 17:43:04	+askore	all right, what part of it are you having difficulty with?
2013-05-06 17:44:33	User998	well i made one just to see if the node's data matches with the match, but it's not giving me consistent results, so i'm not sure if it's right
2013-05-06 17:44:58	User998	i think that i understand the concept of recursion, i just get into snags trying to implement it
2013-05-06 17:45:30	+askore	yeah, recursion can be pretty difficult to get a hang of.
2013-05-06 17:46:03	User998	i think i go wrong in the bottom parts
2013-05-06 17:46:13	User998	i check for !head first
2013-05-06 17:46:32	User998	then if[data matches] return true
2013-05-06 17:46:44	User998	else if[data doesnt match]
2013-05-06 17:46:54	User998	repeat the function with head -> next
2013-05-06 17:47:07	+askore	hmm, that sounds right to me.
2013-05-06 17:47:21	+askore	so if !head you just return false?
2013-05-06 17:47:29	User998	yeah
2013-05-06 17:48:13	+askore	do you have an iterative version of the function that works?
2013-05-06 17:48:32	User998	nope not right now. i probably have an old one though
2013-05-06 17:48:59	+askore	all right, I would say that you should make sure that your check for [data matches] works correctly.
2013-05-06 17:49:06	+askore	your logic looks correct to me.
2013-05-06 17:49:10	User998	okay
2013-05-06 17:49:31	User998	then on my other one, we are supposed to insert a node with '9' after each '2' found in the list
2013-05-06 17:50:53	User998	my function is getting pretty long for this, because don't i have to check to see if a.] the 2 is the last node, b.] second to last node so that i know if i have to connect up the new node
2013-05-06 17:52:49	+askore	that part is probably pretty similar to when you add a node into a list iteratively. Just check for each piece as you go along
2013-05-06 17:53:14	User998	okay that's what i thought. it just ends up with so much that it seems silly to do with recursion
2013-05-06 17:54:44	+askore	the recursion doesn't really affect that part; recursion is just for finding it
2013-05-06 17:54:54	+askore	once you find one you don't need recursion in order to insert another node.
2013-05-06 17:55:47	User998	yeah good point
2013-05-06 19:44:28	User998	askore i'm not sure if you're still online, but your last note about recursion actually cleared it up a lot for me, so thanks

2013-05-07 17:42:37	User261	i am using the rand function in c++ to generate a char so i have the statement char ranchar = 'a' + rand() % (('z'-'a') + 1);, it generates a char but i would like to get say, 6 or 7 or 8 letters to place within an array and cout that array
2013-05-07 17:48:35	User261	any help?
2013-05-07 17:51:41	+lpl	I would recommend putting it in a for loop that updates each element of the array
2013-05-07 17:55:08	User261	right, but how would i assign the generated letter from the function such as the char 'a' into the first element of an array?
2013-05-07 17:57:28	+lpl	array_name[0] = 'a' + rand()... etc

2013-05-09 19:55:17	Zer	Hey guys can anyone help me figure out something regarding c++, I am in CS162
2013-05-09 19:56:03	zaalatta	Zer: Ask your question and someone should get back to you. If no one answers, you can send it to tutors@cs.pdx.edu
2013-05-09 19:57:10	Zer	Sure thing thanks zaalatta
2013-05-09 19:58:22	zaalatta	No problem :)
2013-05-09 20:00:21	Zer	I am facing difficulties in a program I am writing, it's supposed to be a word matching game, player 1 enters 3-5 words and player 2 creates a sentence or a phrase using those words, I am facing difficulties with figuring out how to calculate the score and the score is based on the unused words from those 3-5 words, the player with the lowest score wins, here is a snippet of my function for you to understand the idea.   http://pastebin.com/pzaEuDug
2013-05-09 20:09:13	Zer	?
2013-05-09 20:14:20	zaalatta	You could have an array of arrays and input each word of the phrase Player 2 creates as one element of this array of arrays
2013-05-09 20:15:04	zaalatta	That way you could count how many words they used and add 1 point for each word they didn't use
2013-05-09 20:16:22	zaalatta	Alternatively, you could loop through the 'phrase' variable and have a counter that you increment after every space you encounter
2013-05-09 20:17:05	zaalatta	If I'm understanding this correctly, you're trying to figure out how to keep track of the number of words Player 2 uses of the 3-5, right?
2013-05-09 20:18:31	Zer	Yes correct, but player 2 has to create a phrase, for example player 1 gave player two the words "car" "jack" "peter"  and player 2 created the sentence "jack's car is very luxurious" he failed to use the word
2013-05-09 20:18:33	Zer	p
2013-05-09 20:18:37	Zer	"peter"
2013-05-09 20:18:41	Zer	so player 2
2013-05-09 20:18:46	Zer	's score is 1 point
2013-05-09 20:18:54	Zer	sorry i keep pressing enter by mistake.
2013-05-09 20:20:48	Zer	If I do create a for loop, how will I only extract the words only player one chose and not the other words player 2 entered, for example. "jack" and "car" were entered by player 1 but is very luxurious are just words that player two used and aren't counted towards the score.
2013-05-09 20:20:58	zaalatta	Oh, I see. The user doesn't have to use only the words Player 1 gave him?
2013-05-09 20:21:43	Zer	If player 2 chooses not to use any of the words, he will surely lose because he will get 3 points if player 1 wrote 3 words
2013-05-09 20:23:09	zaalatta	You'd have to do some comparisons using strcmp
2013-05-09 20:23:28	Zer	This is copied directly from the assignment, if my explanation wasn't clear enough.  Matching a. Player 1 types in 3-5 words b. Player 2 creates a phrase with all of the words put together in a  sentence (they can use more words) c. The program computes the score based on the number of  unused words. Again, the player with the lowest score will win.
2013-05-09 20:24:29	zaalatta	Hmm
2013-05-09 20:24:36	Zer	If I use strcmp, how would you suggest me to approach using it?
2013-05-09 20:25:27	zaalatta	I, personally, would try an array of arrays - but that might be a bit difficult
2013-05-09 20:26:27	Zer	I honestly have no idea of using arrays of arrays
2013-05-09 20:26:28	zaalatta	You could try something to do with the spaces in the phrase Player 2 enters and comparing letter for letter
2013-05-09 20:26:51	Slim	So basically what you need to do is go through the entered sentence and see if it contains any of the words?
2013-05-09 20:27:01	Zer	Yes,
2013-05-09 20:27:45	Zer	If he uses all the words player 1 gave him player 2 will get a 0 [lowest score wins]
2013-05-09 20:28:25	Slim	Ah I see.
2013-05-09 20:28:29	 *	Slim thinking
2013-05-09 20:30:59	Zer	How about, if I ask player 2 how many words he uses and make them re-enter them again and using for loops to compare the words player one entered with player 2 entered by using strcmp?
2013-05-09 20:31:37	Slim	hm check out the built in string function strpos()
2013-05-09 20:31:41	Slim	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd355417.aspx
2013-05-09 20:31:42	Zer	he used*
2013-05-09 20:32:02	Slim	It searches for a string within a string
2013-05-09 20:32:19	Slim	returns 0 if it's not found :)
2013-05-09 20:32:30	Slim	Do you have Karla?
2013-05-09 20:32:42	Zer	Yes, sir.
2013-05-09 20:32:56	Slim	I believe she lets you use the string functions right?
2013-05-09 20:33:36	Slim	let me test this out
2013-05-09 20:34:11	zaalatta	Slim: She lets them use strlen, strcmp, strcpy - idk about anything else
2013-05-09 20:34:23	Zer	Correct, but one her TA's mentioned that if we use things we haven't taken yet it might make us lose marks.
2013-05-09 20:34:31	Zer	one of *
2013-05-09 20:34:32	Slim	oh. Oops!
2013-05-09 20:34:52	Zer	Yeah, some people went with tutor's suggestions of using strtok
2013-05-09 20:35:21	Zer	Would my suggestion above work?
2013-05-09 20:38:19	Slim	I guess i'm just not sure what exactly you meant by that suggestion.
2013-05-09 20:39:12	Zer	Yeah thought about it for a minute, I don't believe it will work
2013-05-09 20:40:07	Zer	What I was thinking of doing was.
2013-05-09 20:44:01	Zer	.
2013-05-09 20:44:02	Zer	When player 2 enters a phrase, I would ask him about how many words he used from the words that player one gave him and them prompt him re enter the words and comparing the words he re-entered with the words that player 1 entered using strcmp

2013-05-09 20:46:34	Slim	I'm not sure:)
2013-05-09 20:47:08	Zer	Anyways, what I was thinking about was
2013-05-09 20:47:15	Slim	"When player 2 enters a phrase, I would ask him about how many words he used from the words that player one gave him and them prompt him re enter the words and comparing the words he re-entered with the words that player 1 entered using strcmp
2013-05-09 20:47:19	Slim	tthat ^?
2013-05-09 20:47:28	Zer	Yes sir!
2013-05-09 20:49:16	Slim	Ah so he types the sentence in, then after that he inputs how many of the words he used, and then .. ( i'm not sure what the last part is)
2013-05-09 20:49:33	Slim	so you want the player2 to re-enter the phrase? or the words he used?
2013-05-09 20:51:30	Zer	I am sorry I typed that really fast I even couldn't understand it myself after reading it lol.
2013-05-09 20:51:41	Slim	haha
2013-05-09 20:51:43	Slim	it'sokay
2013-05-09 20:52:53	Zer	Yes and then he would entered what are the words that he used and then O
2013-05-09 20:53:14	Zer	I'd use strcmp to compare those words to the words player one entered for him
2013-05-09 20:54:00	zaalatta	What you could do is have them input the whole phrase into an array, then loop through the array and put each word into a new array, then compare each new array with the words Player 1 entered
2013-05-09 20:54:05	-->	whopper (whopper@serenity.cat.pdx.edu) has joined #cshelp
2013-05-09 20:55:10	Slim	How could we loop through the phrase and parse it after the spaces?
2013-05-09 20:55:31	Slim	c++ is terrible at parsing lol :p
2013-05-09 20:56:40	Zer	zaalatta won't that count all the sentence rather than the words player 1 entered that are  used in the sentence?
2013-05-09 20:57:55	zaalatta	Well, you could copy each element over until you encounter a space, then create a new array and do it over again
2013-05-09 20:58:11	Slim	with cin.get?
2013-05-09 20:58:18	Slim	well never mind ignore that
2013-05-09 20:58:34	zaalatta	Just the assignment operator should work

2013-05-09 20:59:29	nameless	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/
2013-05-09 21:00:21	Zer	I don't really understand where you're going with that suggestion honestly zaalatta
2013-05-09 21:00:33	Zer	nameless i can't use strstr, because I haven't learned it yet.
2013-05-09 21:00:53	Slim	i think what she means is break up the sentence after every sentence and strcmp to the three words
2013-05-09 21:00:55	sabreman	strstr takes 2 sttrings, 1 that you are looking through, and the other what you're looking for
2013-05-09 21:01:07	zaalatta	Zer, sorry. What I'm trying to do is break up the phrase into multiple arrays so they're more manageable
2013-05-09 21:01:19	sabreman	and it returns a pointer to the first occurance of the second stirng in string 1, if found
2013-05-09 21:01:23	sabreman	otherwise it returns null
2013-05-09 21:01:36	nameless	...

2013-05-09 21:02:06	Slim	lol :)
2013-05-09 21:02:13	zaalatta	Too many cooks?
2013-05-09 21:02:17	zaalatta	;)
2013-05-09 21:02:33	Slim	Zer can't use any functions besides strcmp, strcpy, .. ? the basic ones that karla teaches
2013-05-09 21:03:37	sabreman	If only you could use vectors and std::string. Life would be so simple.
2013-05-09 21:04:06	Zer	Well zaalatta any word that is in the phrase that is not from the words that player one gave before player 2 made the phrase won't do anything to the scoring, so I don't really need them, My only concern is what words from the words given by player 1 has player 2 used.
2013-05-09 21:04:20	Zer	You are correct Slim, that's what we've learned so far.
2013-05-09 21:04:36	Racoon	so here is what I would do:
2013-05-09 21:05:00	Slim	UHOH
2013-05-09 21:05:01	Racoon	Save P1 words to seperate char[]
2013-05-09 21:05:28	zaalatta	Lol, I think it's time for me to wander away too
2013-05-09 21:05:32	Racoon	then loop through the phrase given by player two, and cut out each word delimiting on spaces
2013-05-09 21:05:45	Racoon	hehe
2013-05-09 21:06:18	Racoon	then simply loop through the words given by player one to see if it matches
2013-05-09 21:06:34	Racoon	if it does -> increment the score
2013-05-09 21:06:40	Slim	What would be your method for cutting out on the space delimiter though?
2013-05-09 21:06:51	Zer	Guys I really appreciate all your help, all of you are being really patient :D
2013-05-09 21:06:59	Slim	No problem :)
2013-05-09 21:07:00	Racoon	This is a blast
2013-05-09 21:07:05	zaalatta	Slim: For loop until you encounter a space
2013-05-09 21:07:09	Slim	we are all learning
2013-05-09 21:07:18	Racoon	well copy each letter until a space
2013-05-09 21:07:25	Racoon	but watch out
2013-05-09 21:07:30	zaalatta	that^
2013-05-09 21:07:34	Racoon	the last word won't have a space after it
2013-05-09 21:07:40	Racoon	;)
2013-05-09 21:07:47	Slim	:O
2013-05-09 21:07:52	zaalatta	So you'd have to be testing for either a space or the \0
2013-05-09 21:07:57	jesusaurus	good thing c-strings are null-terminated :)
2013-05-09 21:08:32	Slim	Okay. But what would be the process for allocating the arrays for copying into?
2013-05-09 21:08:46	Slim	basically have a bunch of arrays ready beforehand?
2013-05-09 21:08:51	Zer	You're idea Racoon sounds amazing, but I have no idea on how to implement it Y_Y
2013-05-09 21:09:04	Slim	Racoon++
2013-05-09 21:09:04	Racoon	easy: one step at a time
2013-05-09 21:09:14	Zer	LOL SLIM
2013-05-09 21:12:28	Zer	so Racoon you were saying
2013-05-09 21:12:43	Racoon	ha sorry, tied up in another channel
2013-05-09 21:13:08	Racoon	so you could prompt the first player for some odd amount of words
2013-05-09 21:13:32	Zer	Racoon take a look at this it's the word input function that
2013-05-09 21:13:35	Zer	I have so far
2013-05-09 21:13:46	Racoon	mkay
2013-05-09 21:13:53	Zer	http://pastebin.com/pzaEuDug
2013-05-09 21:14:38	Zer	ignore the last 2 lines there's a huge error in them lol
2013-05-09 21:14:55	Racoon	not bad
2013-05-09 21:15:00	Racoon	suggestion :
2013-05-09 21:15:33	Racoon	you could by default prompt for words 0ne-three, then only promt once or twice more if four or five are expected
2013-05-09 21:15:39	Racoon	save you some typing
2013-05-09 21:16:00	Racoon	but looks like you're on the right track
2013-05-09 21:17:24	Zer	Yeah, I honestly didn't think about saving typing I just want it to work lol
2013-05-09 21:17:41	Racoon	haha, and? you get it to compile?
2013-05-09 21:17:54	Zer	so regarding your suggestion earlier would you mind explaining it a bit more I am curious
2013-05-09 21:18:10	Racoon	sure
2013-05-09 21:18:19	Zer	yeah it's compiling but I only have the words but nothing regarding the scoring
2013-05-09 21:18:35	Racoon	so you have each of player ones words in seperate char[]
2013-05-09 21:18:47	Racoon	 next loop through the phrase that player two gave
2013-05-09 21:19:00	Racoon	copying each letter into a temporary char[]
2013-05-09 21:19:11	Racoon	until you hit either a space or a '\0'
2013-05-09 21:19:45	Racoon	everytime you fully copy a word, do a strCmp with the words given by player one
2013-05-09 21:20:00	Racoon	once you get a match you can increment the score
2013-05-09 21:20:37	Racoon	or decrement or what have you the capacity to score the game with
2013-05-09 21:21:08	Racoon	couple tips:
2013-05-09 21:21:29	Racoon	keep track of the index that denotes your current position in the phradse
2013-05-09 21:21:45	Racoon	that way after each word you can pick up where you left off
2013-05-09 21:22:15	Racoon	make sure that you add a \0 to the end of the temp after you finish copying a word into it
2013-05-09 21:22:43	Racoon	and you might wanna loop through the temp and zero it out after every word
2013-05-09 21:22:48	Racoon	just to be safe
2013-05-09 21:23:10	Zer	I assume I'd be using strcopy to copy them to other char[] ?
2013-05-09 21:24:50	Racoon	not exactly, strCpy will see the entire phrase as a string
2013-05-09 21:25:26	Racoon	you should just walk down the index copying eacah letter until you either hit a ' ' or '\0'
2013-05-09 21:28:50	Racoon	hows that help?
2013-05-09 21:28:55	Racoon	make sense?
2013-05-09 21:29:26	Zer	Well Racoon I think I'd still have a problem when using your method since i'd still be counting the words that aren't in the words that player 1 gave me so if i compare it with a word the score will be more than what the actual score should be because I am taking all the words in the phrase rather than just the words that player 2 used from the words that player  1 gave him  am I correct?
2013-05-09 21:31:10	Racoon	right
2013-05-09 21:31:22	Racoon	but that is where strCmp comes in
2013-05-09 21:31:35	Racoon	It'll tell you if two words match
2013-05-09 21:31:52	Racoon	so if it does match -> only then do you increment the score
2013-05-09 21:32:08	Racoon	if it doesnt -> simply move on to the next word
2013-05-09 21:32:55	Zer	well what we need is the opposite what I should do is not increment the score when they match
2013-05-09 21:33:08	Racoon	oh i c
2013-05-09 21:33:25	Racoon	run me by the scoring real quick
2013-05-09 21:33:36	Racoon	I'm not sure I understand how that works
2013-05-09 21:33:38	Zer	The player with the lowest score wins
2013-05-09 21:33:50	Zer	For each unused word you get 1 point
2013-05-09 21:34:31	Racoon	is it: Total_words_in_phrase - words_used_given_by_player_one
2013-05-09 21:34:44	Racoon	?
2013-05-09 21:34:59	Zer	so if player 1 gave player 2 the words "car" "daniel" "zachary" and player 2 made the sentence "Daniel's car is new" player 2 failed to use the word zachary so he gets 1 point
2013-05-09 21:35:36	Racoon	oh interesting
2013-05-09 21:37:04	Racoon	side note: Daniel and daniel's aren't equal in strCmp's eyes
2013-05-09 21:37:31	Zer	Yeah I realised that after typing XD
2013-05-09 21:38:02	Racoon	hehe, all good
2013-05-09 21:38:10	Racoon	but lets see
2013-05-09 21:38:28	Racoon	so once you match a word, you need to keep track of the fact
2013-05-09 21:39:45	Racoon	i guess, the simplest way that I can think about is to use an integer for each word
2013-05-09 21:40:01	Racoon	like a 'flag'
2013-05-09 21:40:19	Racoon	so that once you are done you can look back and see the flags that were set
2013-05-09 21:41:31	Racoon	that way you can count all of the flags at the end, and subtract that from the total number of words that P1 gave you
2013-05-09 21:42:43	Zer	What would be the benefit of doing that, I don't really get it tbh.
2013-05-09 21:43:09	retrov	it's so you wouldn't have to repeat the strcmp function call again
2013-05-09 21:43:26	retrov	and it's easier to use elsewhere in your code
2013-05-09 21:43:57	Racoon	also there is the chance you see the same word twice
2013-05-09 21:44:26	Racoon	if you increment a counter you will see a 2 and mistake it for two seperate words
2013-05-09 21:45:52	Racoon	P1 -> "Erik" "Bunnies" "Bubbles" "carpet"
2013-05-09 21:46:13	Racoon	P2 -> "Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik"
2013-05-09 21:46:21	Racoon	P2 scores -3
2013-05-09 21:46:25	Racoon	without flags
2013-05-09 21:46:50	Racoon	but scores 3 if you set the flag for the word that stands for i_saw_word_erik
2013-05-09 21:47:20	Racoon	brb
2013-05-09 21:47:26	Racoon	dinner
2013-05-09 21:47:43	Zer	tyt, I'll try to work on the concept
2013-05-09 22:22:07	Racoon	hows it coming?

2013-05-12 23:08:27	Wren	So my knowledge of C++ memory managament is a little rusty. Is it safe to pass a reference to a object allocated on the stack to a vector allocated dynamically? In other words:
2013-05-12 23:08:38	Wren	vector<Things> v = new Vector<Things>
2013-05-12 23:09:01	Wren	v.push_back(Thing('foo'f))
2013-05-12 23:09:26	Wren	err sorry
2013-05-12 23:09:41	Wren	I think I answered my own question.
2013-05-12 23:10:21	Wren	You wouldn't be able to pass a reference, because the vector is expecting an actual object, not a pointer.
2013-05-12 23:10:48	Wren	So the above would create a new copy, and `v.push_back(&thingObj)` would fail.

2013-05-12 23:18:12	Unitas	I just tried it with a very simple case, and the program wouldn't compile sending a reference into an argument list that was expecting an object
2013-05-12 23:18:44	Unitas	so yea I think you're right
2013-05-12 23:19:57	Wren	cool cool
2013-05-12 23:20:35	Unitas	you could pass *&thingObj though

2013-05-13 17:10:50	knick	just sent an email with some code and a question to tutors@cs.pdx.edu
2013-05-13 17:15:25	@krinkle	knick: I see you figured it out :)
2013-05-13 17:15:30	+askore	knick: hello, I'm looking at your code
2013-05-13 17:15:44	knick	yes, thanks
2013-05-13 17:16:31	+askore	ah ok
2013-05-13 17:23:02	knick	tutors: new question
2013-05-13 17:23:13	knick	just emailed main.cpp again
2013-05-13 17:23:37	knick	question: if switching from the 4 step cin process for dynamic memory to using a helper function to replace it
2013-05-13 17:24:00	knick	but i'm sending in multiple arguments based upon the cin
2013-05-13 17:24:18	knick	how can i tell the function i'm sending them to which input is which argument
2013-05-13 17:24:45	knick	for example, lines 64-71 in the main.cpp i just emailed
2013-05-13 17:27:16	beaker	knick: looking at your code now
2013-05-13 17:28:37	beaker	so do u want to get a bunch of dynamic arrays of characters from the user from stdin? and then pass them to to_add.create_job ?
2013-05-13 17:28:55	knick	yes
2013-05-13 17:29:17	knick	but i want to use the input function that i've put in main.cpp to do it
2013-05-13 17:29:45	beaker	gotcha, well as of now you are just continuously creating local variables in your input function and not doing anything with them
2013-05-13 17:30:01	knick	i know
2013-05-13 17:30:20	knick	i sent a previous version of the code about 10 minutes ago
2013-05-13 17:30:25	knick	everything worked fine
2013-05-13 17:30:36	beaker	ah ok one sec lemme look at that one too
2013-05-13 17:30:44	knick	but when I entered nothing when the computer asked for input it caused an infinite loop
2013-05-13 17:30:52	knick	the input function is part of a solution to fix that
2013-05-13 17:32:45	beaker	in the first main.cpp you sent us, you had a bunch of arrays of characters and pointers to characters
2013-05-13 17:32:51	knick	yes
2013-05-13 17:32:57	knick	that builds hash tables just fine
2013-05-13 17:33:17	knick	so long as you enter info when prompted
2013-05-13 17:33:26	knick	if you enter nothing when prompted for info that version enters an infinite loop
2013-05-13 17:33:38	beaker	if you pass those arrays to the input function you made, and strcpy into them that should be fine
2013-05-13 17:34:41	beaker	i actually dont say any of those arrays now in the most recent version of main you sent us
2013-05-13 17:34:44	knick	i thought part of the purpose of an input function was to cut down on the number of local variables
2013-05-13 17:34:54	knick	and cut out some of the code for dynamic input
2013-05-13 17:35:39	beaker	well if you are continuously prompting the user for input an input function can cut down on code size cuz you just keep calling the same function again and again
2013-05-13 17:35:47	knick	right
2013-05-13 17:36:18	knick	I guess I was looking for a way to pass the arrays handled by the input function into the arguments of my insert function
2013-05-13 17:36:42	knick	in line 73
2013-05-13 17:36:50	knick	and 71
2013-05-13 17:37:23	beaker	well, you could add a second argument to input, having the second argument be one of your arrays you want to read in to
2013-05-13 17:37:41	beaker	that way you can keep the prompt as an argument for each time you are calling it
2013-05-13 17:38:13	knick	but I would still need to declare 7 arrys and 7 pointers?
2013-05-13 17:38:20	knick	like in the first version of main.cpp?
2013-05-13 17:39:04	beaker	well to_add.create_job takes 7 arguments, so you need to get that information somehow
2013-05-13 17:39:28	knick	ok
2013-05-13 17:40:11	beaker	yeh either way probably wont be the prettiest ever, but oh well
2013-05-13 17:40:16	knick	true
2013-05-13 17:40:28	knick	can you explain why it's entering an infinite loop in the first version?
2013-05-13 17:40:49	knick	if the client enters a blank array when asked for input
2013-05-13 17:41:03	beaker	do you have a line number?
2013-05-13 17:41:27	knick	it happens in multiple places
2013-05-13 17:41:51	beaker	case 'A' ?
2013-05-13 17:42:00	knick	A, S, and R
2013-05-13 17:42:06	knick	after you're prompted for input
2013-05-13 17:42:09	knick	if you type nothing and hit enter
2013-05-13 17:42:17	knick	it enters an infinite loop
2013-05-13 17:42:22	knick	IO jams somehow
2013-05-13 17:42:49	knick	and it infinitely repeats the root menu and the cout statements for that particular function that jammed it
2013-05-13 17:43:06	beaker	probably just happens with cin.get when you provide no input
2013-05-13 17:43:25	beaker	does it work when you enter actual input? like the "beaker"?
2013-05-13 17:43:32	knick	it works with real input
2013-05-13 17:43:48	knick	all the functions work so long as you enter input when requested
2013-05-13 17:44:08	beaker	then thats fine
2013-05-13 17:44:17	knick	ok
2013-05-13 17:45:01	beaker	yeh im not sure why cin,get behaves that way
2013-05-13 17:45:16	knick	thanks for looking at it
2013-05-13 17:45:20	beaker	your welcome
2013-05-13 17:45:26	beaker	anything else you need help with?
2013-05-13 17:45:31	knick	that's it
2013-05-13 17:46:16	beaker	ok then for the time being we will consider the email you sent us as closed
2013-05-13 17:46:26	knick	sounds good
2013-05-13 17:49:07	beaker	knick: check out this link: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/get/
2013-05-13 17:49:21	beaker	it may help with understand issues associated with cin.get

2013-05-15 23:06:26	pfaffle	20:28:38   sabreman | firstly to get assembly compile with the -S flag for g++ (capital s)
2013-05-15 23:06:28	pfaffle	20:29:01   sabreman | secondly, don't compile with the debug flag (-g) otehrwise you get a shitton of bs assembly that you

2013-05-16 15:33:11	User696	on the man pages it looks like there's a -Q, do i need to do both of those?

2013-05-16 15:47:02	User696	ok were your times really different?
2013-05-16 15:48:37	sabreman	basicly 0 for max optimisations. a tiny bit longer for in-lining and no optimisatinos
2013-05-16 15:48:43	User696	bc mine have all been the same
2013-05-16 15:48:46	User696	almost the same
2013-05-16 15:49:14	User696	but also mine didnt change much for the last assignment either
2013-05-16 15:49:20	User696	so maybe it's my computer or something
2013-05-16 15:49:21	sabreman	make sure that for teh optimisations you re suing the command -O4

2013-05-16 21:32:33	bowzr	does anyone know of any good websites where i can lists of assembly code keywords and what they mean?
2013-05-16 21:33:23	bowzr	more specifically, assembly code generated by a g++ -S with a .cpp file
2013-05-16 21:50:23	zaalatta	That would be incredibly helpful
2013-05-16 21:50:36	 *	zaalatta is having trouble with the optimized code -_-

2013-05-16 22:26:24	 *	pfaffle also
2013-05-16 22:28:06	kini	bowzr, zaalatta - you might want to try -O0 with g++
2013-05-16 22:28:15	kini	that should simplify the generated assembly slightly
2013-05-16 22:28:37	kini	as for what the various instructions are, you can google for the x86 instruction set
2013-05-16 22:28:45	zaalatta	kini: we need to compile our programs with -O4 for the assignment
2013-05-16 22:28:52	kini	wtf?
2013-05-16 22:28:55	kini	does -O4 even exist?
2013-05-16 22:29:01	zaalatta	Apparently
2013-05-16 22:29:06	kini	it doesn't
2013-05-16 22:29:09	kini	in gcc anyway
2013-05-16 22:29:15	zaalatta	We're using g++
2013-05-16 22:29:20	kini	g++ is gcc
2013-05-16 22:29:30	zaalatta	No... gcc is used for c, right?
2013-05-16 22:29:36	zaalatta	and g++ for C++?
2013-05-16 22:29:46	zaalatta	Maybe?
2013-05-16 22:29:59	kini	gcc and g++ are both commands that call the same basic program
2013-05-16 22:30:26	zaalatta	How come when bowzr tried compiling his program with gcc he got a weird error but g++ didn't bring up the error?
2013-05-16 22:30:41	kini	they call the same basic program, but depending on which command you use, it has different default options
2013-05-16 22:30:56	kini	but the options you can pass to them are the same
2013-05-16 22:30:59	kini	and -O4 is not one of them
2013-05-16 22:31:08	zaalatta	But it works...
2013-05-16 22:31:36	zaalatta	I mean it doesn't give an error or whatever
2013-05-16 22:31:38	kini	what version of gcc?
2013-05-16 22:31:53	kini	it's probably just ignoring it, or rounding it down to -O3 (which is the highest optimization level available)
2013-05-16 22:31:58	zaalatta	Um... would that be in the man page?

2013-05-16 22:34:01	zaalatta	No
2013-05-16 22:34:31	kini	I'm guessing that means it doesn't exist

2013-05-17 00:23:21	Zeroun	Hello.
2013-05-17 00:23:54	Zeroun	Is there a way for me in C++ to ask the user to input a name and use the name he inputted as a name of an array of characters?
2013-05-17 01:02:25	kini	I don't think so, but more importantly why do you want to do that?
2013-05-17 01:07:51	Zeroun	It's for an assignment, to make a user enter the category of the photo and that make that category into an array so that I can add all photos of that category into one array so that the user can display photos in a certain category only without using predefined categories
2013-05-17 01:08:03	Zeroun	not actual photos only file names and etc.

2013-05-17 01:25:06	kini	Zeroun: but why do you need the *name* of the array to match the name the user inputted?
2013-05-17 01:25:52	kini	in most languages, names of variables and things like that are just conveniences for the programmer and are never actually relevant to the program's runtime behavior
2013-05-17 01:26:16	kini	when you define a variable called "foo", there's no way to have your program know, while it's running, that the variable is called "foo"
2013-05-17 01:26:24	TheShazbot	if you're looking for having a name related to it, I would make a named pointer with a string that points to array1 or something

2013-05-17 01:49:44	Zeroun	another link for easier viewing
2013-05-17 01:49:45	Zeroun	https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5e4feegg5b0aHRJVWI2aWxZVFU/edit
2013-05-17 01:50:03	pilgrimd	Considering that it uses external data files, think about how you would want to access the information.
2013-05-17 01:50:13	Zeroun	TheShazbot, I am almost done, I just have no idea how to implement a search by whatever
2013-05-17 01:50:21	pilgrimd	For example, do you want to list all photos in a given category, or everything in a particular place?
2013-05-17 01:50:37	pilgrimd	Perhaps you just want to get all the info about a single photo.
2013-05-17 01:50:49	Zeroun	I have to do it by category
2013-05-17 01:50:50	pilgrimd	How you answer those questions changes how to you store the info.
2013-05-17 01:50:59	Zeroun	"IMPORTANT: Your program should allow photos to be added to the list (up to 20), saved them in external storage, load in photos previously stored, and allow the user to display all photos in a particular category (e.g., if the user wants to know all about the photos with friends). Let the user continue to add photos or display using a loop until they want to quit."
2013-05-17 01:51:35	Zeroun	but the thing that's giving me a hard time is, how can I do that without pre-defining the categories!
2013-05-17 01:51:47	pilgrimd	Ok. If you wanted to quickly list off every photo in a given category, how might you organize the data files?
2013-05-17 01:52:17	pilgrimd	Zeroun: There's a hint to that two paragraphs before the one you quoted.
2013-05-17 01:52:45	pilgrimd	kini was right in that you can't define a *variable* name per user input.
2013-05-17 01:52:51	kini	(in C++, anyway)
2013-05-17 01:53:09	kini	(and more importantly you shouldn't want to do that)

2013-05-17 01:59:06	TheShazbot	search by said integer in the struct
2013-05-17 01:59:08	TheShazbot	maybe
2013-05-17 02:00:53	TheShazbot	sequential searches might help you.

2013-05-17 02:05:57	Zeroun	are you sure about the page number shazbot?
2013-05-17 02:06:15	Zeroun	it pointed me to the beginning of structs rather than the sequential searches you talked about
2013-05-17 02:07:10	TheShazbot	I've got the 4th edition book
2013-05-17 02:07:20	pilgrimd	You guys can use external files.  You can name a file just about anything, right?
2013-05-17 02:07:20	TheShazbot	so that's probably why, sorry
2013-05-17 02:11:58	Zeroun	True pilgrimd
2013-05-17 02:12:11	Zeroun	Shazbot, can you please tell me in what chapter is it?
2013-05-17 02:12:47	TheShazbot	Chapter 11: the struct chapter
2013-05-17 02:14:36	Zeroun	I can't find anything about sequential searches, that;s weird :S
2013-05-17 02:20:41	Zeroun	Found it! thanks.
2013-05-17 02:23:20	Zeroun	Shazbot, or anyone
2013-05-17 02:23:30	Zeroun	Can I predefine the categories?
2013-05-17 02:23:35	Zeroun	it would make things much easier!
2013-05-17 02:25:25	kini	a sequential search is just what it sounds like
2013-05-17 02:25:58	kini	start at the beginning of the data structure and go through each part checking whether it's what you're looking for, until you find it or run out of pieces to check
2013-05-17 02:26:11	kini	I doubt you need to look up anything about sequential searches in order to write one
2013-05-17 02:48:26	Zeroun	Thanks kini.

2013-05-19 17:12:46	Tim	Awesome, can the odin servers compile it as well?
2013-05-19 17:15:41	nightfly	It looks like odin has fairly old version or ruby available. I also wouldn't recommend odin as a host to use unless absolutely required.
2013-05-19 17:20:04	Tim	I believe I don't have access to the cs servers at the moment, so odin is my only choice. Would you recommend downloading a third party program to compile it on my home pc?
2013-05-19 17:23:09	nightfly	absolutely. http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ can help you get ruby installed directly on your machine. If you are using windows you'll find the section titled RubyInstaller most helpful. If you have a decent machine you can also run ruby in a linux virtual machine.
2013-05-19 17:30:49	Tim	Excellent, thank you very much! I'll go ahead and download it and use it until I can access the cs servers.

2013-05-22 15:11:50	Slim	Is it possible to do operator overloading with dynamic binding in c++?
2013-05-22 15:12:01	Slim	for example i have a base class account which is virtual
2013-05-22 15:12:29	nUbee	Slim: is the operator overloading function virtual?
2013-05-22 15:12:56	Slim	and i have a pointer account * newAccount; which points to a derived class object savings savingsObj;
2013-05-22 15:13:14	Slim	well the reason I'm askign is because I don't know how it couldbe done
2013-05-22 15:13:18	Slim	I was sort of just wondering
2013-05-22 15:13:45	nUbee	you'd probably want to have it defined in the derived classes
2013-05-22 15:13:55	Slim	Ah for each derived class
2013-05-22 15:14:08	Slim	and I would need a virtual overload function in the base calss?
2013-05-22 15:14:08	nUbee	what are you overloading?
2013-05-22 15:14:13	Slim	operators
2013-05-22 15:14:25	Slim	+, =,  >> , <<
2013-05-22 15:14:26	nUbee	obviously... which ones?
2013-05-22 15:14:27	nUbee	ok
2013-05-22 15:15:08	nUbee	so.. the '+' operator might be doing things differently in a checking object than a savings object
2013-05-22 15:15:28	nUbee	so you might just define them differently for each derived class
2013-05-22 15:15:42	Slim	yeah for sure
2013-05-22 15:16:45	Slim	So of course the base class needs a virtual overload functoin for each one I implement in the derived classes , but do I actually need to anything in that function?
2013-05-22 15:17:10	Slim	cause i will never be comparing, inserting, etc.. a base class obj
2013-05-22 15:17:20	nUbee	if the base class is not going to be used... you don't need to implement anything
2013-05-22 15:17:30	Slim	K, thanks a lot
2013-05-22 15:17:31	Slim	:)
2013-05-22 15:17:41	nUbee	just write something like... virtual func() = 0;
2013-05-22 15:17:57	nUbee	anytime!
2013-05-22 15:18:06	Slim	Sure. ty
2013-05-22 15:20:16	TheShazbot	umlaut power
2013-05-22 15:29:43	MaddHatter	if you create a pure abstract virtual function in the base, the compiler will not allow instantiation of the base class. (so, what nUbee said)
2013-05-22 15:30:58	MaddHatter	(constructors and destructors can't be virtual though, so make sure any concrete class objects are destroyed via concrete class types, not via the abstract type)

2013-05-22 15:58:50	wbrennan	I have a question regarding passing structs to a function that is using linear linked lists. Specifically I am working with a hash table
2013-05-22 16:00:18	wbrennan	Is it better to create an instance of the struct in main, then in the storing function, create a new node and copy that information into it
2013-05-22 16:01:21	wbrennan	or have main create a new node and pass a pointer to that node into the function?
2013-05-22 16:03:54	@krinkle	wbrennan: what class are you in?
2013-05-22 16:04:00	wbrennan	cs163
2013-05-22 16:04:08	nUbee	wbrennan: If this is for CS163, I would recommend creating a temporary instance of the struct in main and then copy it in your data structure
2013-05-22 16:04:15	@krinkle	^ yep
2013-05-22 16:04:53	nUbee	the idea is to have anything created in your data structure, not be able to be touched outside of it
2013-05-22 16:05:19	wbrennan	ah I see. that does make sense
2013-05-22 16:05:23	wbrennan	thank you very much!

2013-05-23 13:33:13	User485	sure. do you want all of it or just the hash.cpp or just a particular function?
2013-05-23 13:40:27	@krinkle	User485: send us the part that is segfaulting
2013-05-23 13:41:08	User485	ok
2013-05-23 14:30:32	@krinkle	User485: sorry, I got pulled away
2013-05-23 14:31:08	@krinkle	your segfault isn't jumping out at me
2013-05-23 14:31:38	User485	shoot!
2013-05-23 14:31:40	@krinkle	are you initializing each element of hash_table to NULL before using it?
2013-05-23 14:31:50	User485	yeah in the constructor
2013-05-23 14:31:55	@krinkle	hrm
2013-05-23 14:32:19	User485	whats hrm?
2013-05-23 14:32:55	@krinkle	just hmmm
2013-05-23 14:33:16	@krinkle	can you show how you're initializing hash_table in your constructor?
2013-05-23 14:33:34	User485	sure
2013-05-23 14:35:12	@krinkle	also, at what point is it segfaulting? does it print anything out before segfaulting?
2013-05-23 14:35:54	@krinkle	it will probably be most helpful to use gdb to pinpoint exactly where it's segfaulting, if you haven't already
2013-05-23 14:36:08	User485	it returns a few of my test outputs, then the insert function returns a 1 bc i have a statement that says if it was successful or not, though it might not be quite right
2013-05-23 14:36:17	User485	yeah i'm not great at gdb
2013-05-23 14:36:24	User485	i can't remember all the steps to do it
2013-05-23 14:36:47	User485	here are the three lines of the constructor, can i just paste it on here?
2013-05-23 14:36:57	@krinkle	that's okay, all you need to do is recompile your program with a -g, like g++ -g file.cpp, and then run gdb a.out, then in the gdb shell run 'run'
2013-05-23 14:37:01	@krinkle	and it should tell you
2013-05-23 14:37:23	User485	okay i'll try it
2013-05-23 14:37:29	@krinkle	i need to run to a meeting for a few minutes, i will be back soon if someone else isn't around to help out
2013-05-23 14:37:33	User485	ok
2013-05-23 14:46:37	User485	oh so it doesnt like my destructor actually. i wasn't really sure what exactly needed to be done, so i'm not surprised that it has a problem
2013-05-23 14:47:06	User485	i'll look through it, but maybe i can send that in too?
2013-05-23 14:49:02	@krinkle	User485: sure
2013-05-23 15:05:33	User485	i think i just need to say if[temp -> next] temp = temp -> next
2013-05-23 15:05:42	User485	then say while[temp]
2013-05-23 15:09:49	User485	shoot it still stops at that same line
2013-05-23 15:49:26	@krinkle	User485: sorry for the intermittent help
2013-05-23 15:49:31	@krinkle	I'm looking at your destructor now
2013-05-23 15:50:31	User485	no problem! i appreciate any help!
2013-05-23 15:52:42	@krinkle	if it's segfaulting at something like X->Y that usually means that X can't be dereferenced
2013-05-23 15:52:59	@krinkle	why are you checking temp->next instead of temp?
2013-05-23 15:55:31	@krinkle	also current isn't an array, it should just be one node, so you shouldn't have to use [] when you delete it

2013-05-24 14:56:41	Slim	hey protoben or askore can I get some quick help with my code once you guys are done helping whoever you're helping?
2013-05-24 14:58:04	Slim	meanwhile, I'm having an issue with what looks to be my virtual destructor for a base class. whenever the program hits the ending curly bracket of the virtual destructor it just goes itno a memory leak
2013-05-24 15:05:20	+askore	Slim: are you in the cs lounge? or over irc?
2013-05-24 15:05:32	Slim	i can coe in

2013-05-24 15:55:47	kini	but then I don't get to sit here and laugh at how terrible Slim's code and askore and protoben's tutoring skills are...

2013-05-24 18:47:20	OZmc	can somone tell me why the following code only outputs "s" and not "string"
2013-05-24 18:47:23	OZmc	char ** test;
2013-05-24 18:47:23	OZmc	test = new char * [2];
2013-05-24 18:47:23	OZmc	test[0]= "string" ;
2013-05-24 18:47:23	OZmc	cout<<*test[0];
2013-05-24 18:53:32	@krinkle	the test[0] is a pointer to sequential memory containing "string", and dereferencing it gets you the value of the first element that it is pointing to
2013-05-24 18:53:48	@krinkle	so you could get 't' by doing *(test[0]+1)
2013-05-24 18:57:49	OZmc	so i would need a for loop to output string?
2013-05-24 18:58:01	@krinkle	no
2013-05-24 18:58:24	@krinkle	if you want to output the whole string you can just use test[0]
2013-05-24 18:58:45	@krinkle	as a side note you should be allocating memory for your string and using strcpy to copy it in
2013-05-24 18:59:18	kini	lol are string literals allocated on the stack or something
2013-05-24 18:59:50	OZmc	gotcha thanks!
2013-05-24 20:15:48	protoben	kini: yep. temporary variable.
2013-05-24 20:16:00	kini	I guess they would have to be
2013-05-24 20:16:17	kini	since C++ doesn't do automatic memory management
2013-05-24 20:16:33	protoben	sure, rub it in

2013-05-24 22:21:44	Slim	Quick question for anyone cs202+
2013-05-24 22:22:08	Slim	i have a virtual base class pointer which is pointing to a derived object of that base class
2013-05-24 22:22:42	Slim	and i overloaded the << operator. it works fine, but when I try to cout << the base class ptr it just prints the address
2013-05-24 22:23:03	Slim	it prints whether or not i say cout << ptr; or cout << *ptr;

2013-05-26 20:12:47	User428	it's all wonky. is someone online who can help me figure it out?
2013-05-26 20:13:01	User428	i must have some dumb error in it.
2013-05-26 20:19:44	dondon	there should be a few of us online. post some code so we can look at it. Use pastebin or some other service; don't paste in the chat.
2013-05-26 20:20:26	User428	should i just post the link right in here, or to the email?
2013-05-26 20:20:48	dondon	well, i'm not a tutor, so I can't read that email. here would do
2013-05-26 20:20:55	User428	ok
2013-05-26 20:21:33	User428	its supposed to remove any nodes that have a match
2013-05-26 20:21:56	User428	i know mine isnt right, but i cant get my brain to figure out the right way
2013-05-26 20:22:03	User428	i guess i didnt practice this way enough.
2013-05-26 20:22:06	User428	http://pastie.org/private/vr2t910awbekgv9eomdhia
2013-05-26 20:23:12	nUbee	User428: Does hash_func(char*) return a value?
2013-05-26 20:23:56	dondon	a value that you'd put in a variable?
2013-05-26 20:24:14	nUbee	do you mean to write: key = hash_func(comp_to_rm); ?
2013-05-26 20:24:18	User428	yeah it holds the value key
2013-05-26 20:24:41	User428	oh i didnt think i needed to do that, but maybe i do.
2013-05-26 20:25:11	User428	the hash_func finds the key value, which is a private variable, but that's available to both functions since they are in the same class
2013-05-26 20:25:30	User428	so i thought that it just updates "key" and then remove_one can use it
2013-05-26 20:25:42	dondon	so "key" is a variable they both can access? that would work too
2013-05-26 20:25:48	nUbee	ok
2013-05-26 20:27:40	dondon	is hash_table an array of node * ?
2013-05-26 20:28:35	dondon	hmmm you better check that if statement
2013-05-26 20:28:52	nUbee	what if hash_table[key] is the one you want to remove? then you would need to set that variable to the next in the list
2013-05-26 20:29:22	User428	yeah hash_table is an array of node *
2013-05-26 20:29:23	dondon	if(!strcmp(thing1, thing2)) //only run loop if they are NOT equal
2013-05-26 20:29:41	dondon	so you delete every ono-match in that key
2013-05-26 20:29:43	nUbee	no
2013-05-26 20:29:49	dondon	*non-match
2013-05-26 20:29:49	User428	i thought that that line meant it was a zero, so they would be equal
2013-05-26 20:29:52	nUbee	strcmp returns 0 if the two strings match
2013-05-26 20:30:03	dondon	ah
2013-05-26 20:31:06	User428	nUbee: what line are you looking at that needs fixing? i see the area but not sure what exactly will need changing
2013-05-26 20:31:29	nUbee	so you need to cover all cases when removing from a linked list
2013-05-26 20:31:40	nUbee	1. the list is empty: you already did that
2013-05-26 20:31:46	dondon	so the if succeeds, so you set current = NULL; then prev = current. so even if there were more things in that key...
2013-05-26 20:31:51	nUbee	2. the node being removed is the head
2013-05-26 20:32:05	nUbee	in this case, head == hash_table[key]
2013-05-26 20:32:15	TheShazbot	6
2013-05-26 20:32:31	nUbee	so if hash_table[key] is to be removed, then you need to change that variable to the next in the list
2013-05-26 20:33:00	User428	so it would be hash_table[key] = current -> next?
2013-05-26 20:33:53	User428	would i keep that inside the while loop ?
2013-05-26 20:34:08	nUbee	no
2013-05-26 20:34:20	nUbee	you do it before the while loop
2013-05-26 20:34:33	nUbee	the while loop is supposed to be your "traversing loop"
2013-05-26 20:34:36	dondon	nubee: what if you don't want to remove the entry
2013-05-26 20:34:40	User428	ok so itd have its own whole deleting section
2013-05-26 20:34:52	nUbee	User428: exactly
2013-05-26 20:35:00	User428	okay
2013-05-26 20:35:15	nUbee	you have to have something like strcmp(comp_to_rm, hash_table[key]->info.company)
2013-05-26 20:35:35	nUbee	dondon: that's what the strcmp is for
2013-05-26 20:35:53	User428	okay i'm working on that now
2013-05-26 20:36:34	dondon	nubee: current is just a holding value for hash_table[key] though?
2013-05-26 20:37:04	nUbee	current is a temporary pointer that exists only in this function, it doesn't change where hash_table[key] is pointing
2013-05-26 20:37:29	dondon	ah, prev isn't set
2013-05-26 20:37:35	nUbee	if current is pointing to head, and you delete current and set current to NULL, head will still be pointing to that delete memory location
2013-05-26 20:37:49	nUbee	deleted* memory location
2013-05-26 20:38:38	User428	so i need to set both hash_table[key] and current equal to current -> next?
2013-05-26 20:38:46	User428	yeah i guess that makes sense
2013-05-26 20:40:00	dondon	and if the one hash_table[key] points to has a next, but that next shouldn't be deleted,hash_table[key] should = current->next
2013-05-26 20:40:02	nUbee	the current pointer only comes into play when the first node is not the one being deleted
2013-05-26 20:40:15	User428	ok
2013-05-26 20:42:13	User428	i dont understand why it doesnt like my i[current -> next] statements
2013-05-26 20:42:45	dondon	is this before or after you delete current?
2013-05-26 20:43:27	User428	after
2013-05-26 20:43:42	User428	i thought that delete only released the memory
2013-05-26 20:43:45	User428	is this wrong?
2013-05-26 20:43:49	dondon	so current doesn't have a next, since you just scorched it, right?
2013-05-26 20:43:50	User428	i get confused about it
2013-05-26 20:43:54	User428	yeah i suppose so
2013-05-26 20:44:19	User428	what if i set it to NULL
2013-05-26 20:44:52	dondon	delete releases the memory for reuse, yes, so it isn't directly and immediately erased, but it is removed from the list of memory places you are allowed to use
2013-05-26 20:45:03	dondon	so it is an access-violation
2013-05-26 20:45:14	User428	oh okay
2013-05-26 20:45:36	dondon	you need to set whatever needed current->next, before you deleted it
2013-05-26 20:45:55	User428	okay gotcha
2013-05-26 20:46:10	dondon	so a complete LLL delete function needs to go inside your if
2013-05-26 20:46:38	nUbee	I would recommend having your traversal while loop be conditioned on current->next instead of current
2013-05-26 20:47:00	User428	okay
2013-05-26 20:47:08	nUbee	then the following algorithm should hold for non-head removals
2013-05-26 20:47:22	nUbee	while (current->next)
2013-05-26 20:47:36	nUbee	1. If there is a match
2013-05-26 20:47:58	nUbee	1a. prev->next = current->next
2013-05-26 20:48:10	nUbee	1b. current->next = NULL
2013-05-26 20:48:17	nUbee	1c. delete current
2013-05-26 20:48:35	nUbee	2. Otherwise, set prev = current
2013-05-26 20:48:40	nUbee	and current = current->next
2013-05-26 20:48:52	nUbee	terrible pseudocode, I know
2013-05-26 20:49:33	User428	but i can't just delete current->next, because i need to link up any further nodes with the previous
2013-05-26 20:49:38	User428	right?
2013-05-26 20:50:13	nUbee	right... that's why you only delete the current... after connecting the previous with current's next and disconnecting current from the list
2013-05-26 20:50:17	User428	i dont understand why i'd do current 0> next = NULL
2013-05-26 20:50:21	User428	->
2013-05-26 20:50:36	User428	ohhhhhhh
2013-05-26 20:50:42	User428	of course!
2013-05-26 20:50:48	nUbee	I do that because I make destructors that would recursively delete everything after
2013-05-26 20:50:57	nUbee	so setting next to NULL stops that
2013-05-26 20:52:46	User428	okay well it stopped seg faulting! but it didnt clear the entries, so i have a new problem
2013-05-26 20:53:30	nUbee	give your struct/class a destructor and just have delete current
2013-05-26 20:54:09	User428	but shouldnt the destructor go through all the lists and delete everything
2013-05-26 20:54:28	User428	that what [i think] mine does
2013-05-26 20:54:33	dondon	does node have a destructor?
2013-05-26 20:54:34	nUbee	class/struct info?
2013-05-26 20:54:44	User428	the class has a destructor
2013-05-26 20:54:51	User428	the node struct does not
2013-05-26 20:55:17	nUbee	you can add constructor/destructors for structs
2013-05-26 20:55:23	User428	poop
2013-05-26 20:55:33	dondon	then the things in node (info.thing) needs to be deleted somewhere
2013-05-26 20:55:55	User428	but they are being deleted right in my remove function!! right??
2013-05-26 20:56:04	nUbee	yes
2013-05-26 20:56:08	User428	i would assume that the remove_one would take care of that
2013-05-26 20:56:23	nUbee	it's mainly for shortening your code, it's not essential
2013-05-26 20:56:45	dondon	i think we need a new pastie of your changed function, since it now doesn't remove.
2013-05-26 20:56:51	User428	okay i'll send it
2013-05-26 20:57:37	User428	http://pastie.org/private/r4dmzidtmidn1dgagg1uka
2013-05-26 20:57:43	User428	i probably forgot to change something
2013-05-26 20:58:41	User428	i'm adding in a current -> next = NULL in the first portion
2013-05-26 20:58:56	nUbee	that if statement in your head pointer removal is unecessary
2013-05-26 20:59:06	nUbee	if head is the one your are removing,
2013-05-26 20:59:49	nUbee	set current/temp to hash_table[key]->next
2013-05-26 20:59:57	nUbee	then delete hash_table[key]
2013-05-26 21:00:08	nUbee	and then set hash_table[key] to current/temp
2013-05-26 21:00:11	User428	but if there's no next node, then won't that seg fault?
2013-05-26 21:00:24	nUbee	if there is no next node
2013-05-26 21:00:27	nUbee	than it's null
2013-05-26 21:00:34	nUbee	which current would be set to
2013-05-26 21:00:55	nUbee	so the function would end with hash_table[key] being set to NULL
2013-05-26 21:02:32	User428	okay
2013-05-26 21:03:55	User428	ok so now its faulting at while[current -> next]
2013-05-26 21:04:10	User428	so i need to traverse if there is a next first i guess
2013-05-26 21:04:51	User428	oh or just say if theres no current -> next, return?
2013-05-26 21:04:53	nUbee	did you set current to hash_table[key]->next before or after the head node check?
2013-05-26 21:05:14	nUbee	set it before
2013-05-26 21:05:36	User428	i did that one, then i deleted hash_[key] they set hash = current
2013-05-26 21:05:48	User428	im getting lazy with my long variable names
2013-05-26 21:05:50	User428	sorry
2013-05-26 21:07:08	User428	but i'm testing it out with only one company, so there is really no linked list to traverse
2013-05-26 21:07:36	nUbee	lets just refer to hash_table[key] as head
2013-05-26 21:07:46	nUbee	so you check if head is null
2013-05-26 21:07:58	nUbee	then.. you check to see if head is the one you want to remove
2013-05-26 21:08:09	nUbee	if so, then set current to head->next
2013-05-26 21:08:15	dondon	so what happens if you dlete the first entry, and current->next == NULL? you don't delete
2013-05-26 21:08:16	nUbee	and delete head
2013-05-26 21:08:21	nUbee	and set head to current
2013-05-26 21:10:50	User428	oh i deleted head
2013-05-26 21:11:01	User428	oh yeah thats right
2013-05-26 21:11:05	User428	okay
2013-05-26 21:11:20	User428	yeah so that's what i have
2013-05-26 21:12:32	User428	what if inside that loop, at the end, i check for current -> next and return 1 if it's not, so then it just exits
2013-05-26 21:13:35	User428	hmm it doesnt like that either
2013-05-26 21:15:09	nUbee	well.. did you put your head check into an else if section, and your traversal into the else section?
2013-05-26 21:15:40	nUbee	like this: if (head == NULL) ... else if (head to be removed) ... else (traverse the list)
2013-05-26 21:18:10	User428	nope i only have whats on the pastie
2013-05-26 21:18:18	User428	if[!head]
2013-05-26 21:18:25	User428	if[!strcmp ....]
2013-05-26 21:18:32	User428	while[current -> next]
2013-05-26 21:18:38	nUbee	yeah... break them up into if, else if, and else
2013-05-26 21:18:41	User428	ok
2013-05-26 21:19:16	User428	so then for the last else, i'll put a while loop inside it?
2013-05-26 21:19:22	User428	yeah
2013-05-26 21:19:27	User428	ok
2013-05-26 21:19:46	nUbee	pretty much
2013-05-26 21:19:58	nUbee	the if statements should be what your removal cases are
2013-05-26 21:20:04	User428	ok
2013-05-26 21:20:16	nUbee	empty list, remove head, remove from inside list
2013-05-26 21:22:55	User428	holy crap
2013-05-26 21:23:11	User428	i need to send you some kind of present
2013-05-26 21:24:34	nUbee	it worked?
2013-05-26 21:24:40	User428	yeah!
2013-05-26 21:24:43	nUbee	awesome!
2013-05-26 21:25:06	nUbee	I always accept coffee :p
2013-05-26 21:25:12	User428	haha okay
2013-05-26 21:25:26	User428	i'll just start bringing coffee into the tutor center
2013-05-26 21:27:05	User428	oh wait, one more issue
2013-05-26 21:27:24	User428	its only deleting the first one. so if i have two, i have to go through two rounds of deleting to get them both
2013-05-26 21:27:41	nUbee	that's awesome. good thing I'm a CS tutor hahaha
2013-05-26 21:28:09	User428	so should i change the last else to an if[current -> next] to keep going
2013-05-26 21:28:10	nUbee	it's only deleting the first?
2013-05-26 21:28:14	User428	yeah
2013-05-26 21:28:31	nUbee	the else if(head to be removed)
2013-05-26 21:28:44	nUbee	should only be run, if your strcmp() is successful
2013-05-26 21:28:58	User428	right
2013-05-26 21:29:18	User428	but if i have two nodes that both match and need to be deleted, then i need to let it keep traversing
2013-05-26 21:29:48	nUbee	two nodes?
2013-05-26 21:29:55	nUbee	you're remove_one() should only remove one
2013-05-26 21:29:57	User428	i meant like two entries
2013-05-26 21:30:00	User428	oh yeah
2013-05-26 21:30:09	User428	its supposed to mean like remove one company
2013-05-26 21:30:14	User428	that's my bad on naming
2013-05-26 21:30:39	nUbee	so you want to remove several nodes?
2013-05-26 21:30:51	User428	well i need to remove any nodes that match the comp_to_rm
2013-05-26 21:30:57	nUbee	I see
2013-05-26 21:31:13	User428	i could just leave it like this and change the user interface a little
2013-05-26 21:31:17	User428	that's probably be easier
2013-05-26 21:31:27	nUbee	you could run the function multiple times
2013-05-26 21:31:33	User428	yeah i'll do that
2013-05-26 21:31:36	User428	okay all set!
2013-05-26 21:31:37	nUbee	cool
2013-05-26 21:32:01	User428	thanks!
2013-05-26 21:32:05	nUbee	no problem :)
2013-05-26 21:32:11	nUbee	have a good night

2013-05-26 22:38:15	bowzr	so im writing a c++ program, i have a int variable and im trying out something with the system() function. Am i able to use that int inside the system function ? if so, what syntax/format?
2013-05-26 23:36:55	nUbee	bowzr: system() requires a char * input, so you'll need to convert your integer into a string. itoa() might be something to look at. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/itoa/

2013-05-30 20:39:54	User558	i have a quick graphs question for 201
2013-05-30 20:40:23	User558	if my graph is basically an array of linked lists, and i have two ints that are entered at a time by the user
2013-05-30 20:40:33	User558	and i want a to point to b
2013-05-30 20:40:51	User558	if b's index in the array is null, do i add b to there also?
2013-05-30 20:41:09	User558	so i would have a point to b and then also put b in its spot in the array?
2013-05-30 20:41:48	User558	one of the girl tutors explained it to me for a couple minutes today, but now i can't remember what she said about that
2013-05-30 20:56:47	@krinkle	User558: yeah, I think you would have to add b to the array and then add the edge that points from a to b
2013-05-30 20:57:07	User558	okay so now i'm rereading the assignment
2013-05-30 20:57:28	User558	herb wants us to go back through the graph after the building is done
2013-05-30 20:58:07	User558	and i think go in order of how they came to determine whether or not the node is new or pre-existed
2013-05-30 20:58:27	User558	but i don't think that i can do that if i use an array of linked lists
2013-05-30 20:59:10	User558	i heard there is a more complicated way of pointing a node in a list back to its index position, but i don't think i would know how to do that
2013-05-30 20:59:24	User558	so should i NOT use an array of ll's?
2013-05-30 21:00:31	User558	i was just going to go through as its building, but the directions say to go through after, so i guess i can't do that
2013-05-30 21:00:35	@krinkle	I don't see why you couldn't
2013-05-30 21:00:46	User558	is there a difference, besides just the timing?
2013-05-30 21:01:08	User558	like if i go through the output DURING the build, is that a way of cheating the problem?
2013-05-30 21:01:15	User558	herb likes to knock off points!
2013-05-30 21:01:29	User558	he seems to anyways
2013-05-30 21:02:12	@krinkle	I would track him down and ask him--I couldn't say for sure what he's expecting

2013-05-31 01:18:44	User078	my node * root is a private member of the tree class, and inside that class i have wrapper functions that call private functions
2013-05-31 01:19:00	User078	the private functions use root as an argument
2013-05-31 01:19:14	User078	so root is available to both functions being used
2013-05-31 01:19:59	User078	the error says 'root' undeclared [first use this function]
2013-05-31 01:20:21	User078	for the line inside the wrapper function that is calling the private function.
2013-05-31 01:20:32	User078	NONE of my other functions have this error!!!
2013-05-31 01:21:53	sabreman	are you sure the functions is part of the class?
2013-05-31 01:22:03	sabreman	like, do you ahve clas:: before the function name in the .cpp file?
2013-05-31 01:22:13	User078	yeah
2013-05-31 01:22:21	User078	oh let me check
2013-05-31 01:22:51	User078	omg
2013-05-31 01:22:53	User078	that was it
2013-05-31 01:22:55	sabreman	:p
2013-05-31 01:23:01	User078	what an IDIOT
2013-05-31 01:23:04	User078	hahahah
2013-05-31 01:23:17	sabreman	well, goog night (and good luck) i'm off
2013-05-31 01:23:22	User078	i was stuck on that for an hour
2013-05-31 01:23:24	User078	thanks!

2013-05-31 15:37:47	Slim	just curious... Would it be more efficient in C++ to return an item from a function and set it to another item versus passing in a data item by reference and modifying it in the function without returning it?
2013-05-31 15:39:54	Slim	like data = return_item();    vs     assign_item_to(data);

2013-05-31 15:56:45	Racoon	im a fan of the first
2013-05-31 15:57:01	Slim	Any particular reasons/
2013-05-31 15:57:15	Slim	Or just better readability?
2013-05-31 15:58:46	Racoon	mostly readability, it helps me understand my recursive recipes
2013-05-31 15:59:48	Slim	But you're not sure which is more efficient?
2013-05-31 16:00:31	Slim	if you have a program that does operations like that on a large scale, it could possibly  make a difference right/
2013-05-31 16:01:13	Racoon	one may have some benifit over the other, but I feel like it all depends on the app
2013-05-31 16:01:47	Racoon	what is your algorithm
2013-05-31 16:01:49	Racoon	?
2013-05-31 16:02:08	Slim	I don't have an algorithm, I was sort of just wondering about this
2013-05-31 16:02:47	Slim	This isn't for any specific program or anythin
2013-05-31 16:02:51	Racoon	word
2013-05-31 16:04:43	Racoon	well say you had to remove a node in a BST, and you found your node, you could saysomething like previous->left = findNextNode(current) and it would traverse from current and return some leave(withoutchildren) to fit in the removed nodes location
2013-05-31 16:05:26	Slim	for sure
2013-05-31 16:05:27	Racoon	or null it current has no children

2013-06-01 19:02:23	User293	i have a 163 bst problem
2013-06-01 19:02:29	User293	i just sent an email to the tutor email
2013-06-01 19:02:40	User293	its for an insert function
2013-06-01 19:03:18	User293	i need to return the root position so that the insert function can just insert the info
2013-06-01 19:12:35	nUbee	Hey User293, I can help you. Just give me one moment to take a look at your e-mail
2013-06-01 19:14:11	nUbee	May I ask what error you are receiving?
2013-06-01 19:17:10	nUbee	In your place() function, a_job is a pre-built node that you inserting into the tree?
2013-06-01 19:21:47	User293	a_job is an object of the struct that holds all the job info
2013-06-01 19:22:18	User293	i thought that maybe passing root by reference with 'place' would then return automatically the new root position
2013-06-01 19:22:47	User293	oh shoot. i think i need to then create a new node!
2013-06-01 19:22:49	User293	i forgot about that
2013-06-01 19:22:55	nUbee	here's what I would recommend with your recurrive function()
2013-06-01 19:23:02	User293	the error i get is
2013-06-01 19:23:10	nUbee	go aheard
2013-06-01 19:23:12	nUbee	ahead*
2013-06-01 19:23:40	User293	how do i type ampersand?
2013-06-01 19:23:50	nUbee	& - shift 7
2013-06-01 19:23:59	User293	haha thanks
2013-06-01 19:24:02	User293	no on here
2013-06-01 19:24:04	nUbee	no problem
2013-06-01 19:24:15	User293	it erases my line
2013-06-01 19:24:23	User293	i'll just copy and paste
2013-06-01 19:24:25	nUbee	what are you using to connect to IRC?
2013-06-01 19:24:41	User293	Undefined                       first referenced  symbol                             in file tree::place(job&, node*&)           /var/tmp//ccMeKf2z.o ld: fatal: symbol referencing errors. No output written to a.out collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2013-06-01 19:24:48	User293	ummm the internet?
2013-06-01 19:25:09	nUbee	I meant what computer OS or program
2013-06-01 19:25:27	nUbee	gnu/linux, windows, puTTY, terminal, etc
2013-06-01 19:25:55	nUbee	I suppose that doesn't matter right now
2013-06-01 19:26:32	nUbee	here's what I recommend for a recursive insert function
2013-06-01 19:26:59	nUbee	have your function return a "node *"
2013-06-01 19:27:36	User293	oh i can have that be the return type??
2013-06-01 19:27:37	nUbee	and pass in the temporary "job" object, and a node *
2013-06-01 19:27:38	nUbee	yes
2013-06-01 19:27:43	nUbee	it's very handy
2013-06-01 19:27:55	User293	so should i put root back to by value
2013-06-01 19:28:10	nUbee	hmm
2013-06-01 19:28:32	nUbee	it depends if there is a possibility of changing where root points to
2013-06-01 19:28:41	User293	i just want to add at the bottom of the tree
2013-06-01 19:28:45	nUbee	yes
2013-06-01 19:28:48	User293	so no i guess root should stay
2013-06-01 19:29:01	nUbee	so what's the base case?
2013-06-01 19:29:07	nUbee	I'll call the node * ptr
2013-06-01 19:29:15	nUbee	if ptr is NULL
2013-06-01 19:29:15	User293	ok
2013-06-01 19:29:24	nUbee	return insert() function
2013-06-01 19:29:34	nUbee	which copies the temp job object into a new one
2013-06-01 19:29:53	User293	whoa mine is like backwards from that
2013-06-01 19:30:00	User293	my insert function calls place
2013-06-01 19:30:03	User293	should i change it
2013-06-01 19:30:09	nUbee	I see
2013-06-01 19:30:11	nUbee	hmmm
2013-06-01 19:30:43	User293	i would think that they do basically the same thing right?
2013-06-01 19:30:48	nUbee	I suppose if the job object is being created inside your data structure, then placed in the tree
2013-06-01 19:30:51	nUbee	that would be fine
2013-06-01 19:30:54	nUbee	ok then
2013-06-01 19:31:20	nUbee	so I'll assume you have a pre-built job to place into the tree
2013-06-01 19:31:26	nUbee	so base case:
2013-06-01 19:31:31	User293	i dont think i like the if[!root -> left] return statement
2013-06-01 19:31:36	User293	and with right
2013-06-01 19:31:41	nUbee	yeah, it won't really do anything
2013-06-01 19:31:44	User293	ok
2013-06-01 19:32:05	nUbee	base case: if ptr is NULL, then ptr.data = "job to insert"
2013-06-01 19:32:09	nUbee	and return ptr
2013-06-01 19:32:30	nUbee	otherwise
2013-06-01 19:33:19	nUbee	if "job to insert" is less than ptr's data, ptr->left = place(job, ptr->left)
2013-06-01 19:33:38	nUbee	else, ptr->right = place(job, ptr->right)
2013-06-01 19:34:00	User293	so i'm not using root -> left or root -> right anymore
2013-06-01 19:34:07	User293	i'm changing to node*
2013-06-01 19:34:36	User293	?
2013-06-01 19:34:42	nUbee	basically, you are reconstructing the tree
2013-06-01 19:34:58	User293	i guess i don't really understand why we don't just traverse with root
2013-06-01 19:35:07	nUbee	well.. you can call it whatever you want
2013-06-01 19:35:14	nUbee	I just called it ptr instead of root
2013-06-01 19:35:18	nUbee	to avoid confusions
2013-06-01 19:35:22	nUbee	I guess that didn't help
2013-06-01 19:35:29	User293	oh i thought ptr was =node*
2013-06-01 19:35:35	User293	which is my return type?
2013-06-01 19:35:36	nUbee	ptr is a node *
2013-06-01 19:35:38	nUbee	yes
2013-06-01 19:35:39	User293	right
2013-06-01 19:35:58	User293	okay so just to clarify
2013-06-01 19:36:02	nUbee	ok
2013-06-01 19:36:15	User293	my return type is "node*"
2013-06-01 19:36:23	User293	but i'm still traversing with 'root'
2013-06-01 19:36:34	nUbee	yes
2013-06-01 19:36:53	nUbee	well... yes, since you should pass root by value
2013-06-01 19:37:15	User293	okay
2013-06-01 19:37:21	User293	i'll see if that fixes it!
2013-06-01 19:37:27	nUbee	something like this: node * place(job & toInsert, node * root)
2013-06-01 19:37:50	User293	ok
2013-06-01 19:42:04	User293	okay can i send another email with the newer code and the new error?
2013-06-01 19:42:12	User293	or i'll just pastie it in here
2013-06-01 19:42:24	nUbee	a pastie would be cleaner
2013-06-01 19:42:31	nUbee	and easier
2013-06-01 19:42:38	User293	ok
2013-06-01 19:42:47	nUbee	pastie or pastbin
2013-06-01 19:42:50	nUbee	pastebin*
2013-06-01 19:43:11	User293	http://pastie.org/private/u0tlqb5yfxqxs8s93o80w
2013-06-01 19:43:57	nUbee	you're not returning anything in your base case
2013-06-01 19:44:12	User293	oh right
2013-06-01 19:44:18	User293	so i return root
2013-06-01 19:45:21	nUbee	http://pastie.org/7995068# this should work
2013-06-01 19:45:23	User293	okay that worked
2013-06-01 19:45:24	nUbee	it's not c++ code
2013-06-01 19:45:34	nUbee	sort of :p
2013-06-01 19:45:38	User293	uh oh
2013-06-01 19:45:42	User293	what does that mean
2013-06-01 19:45:56	nUbee	it means you'll need to transcribe it yourself
2013-06-01 19:46:07	User293	haha
2013-06-01 19:46:07	nUbee	but it's simple enough
2013-06-01 19:46:15	User293	i dont think i know how to do that
2013-06-01 19:46:17	User293	!
2013-06-01 19:46:23	nUbee	for example
2013-06-01 19:46:31	nUbee	I don't know how you do your comparing of nodes
2013-06-01 19:46:38	nUbee	you can implement that your way
2013-06-01 19:46:49	nUbee	but that function I pasted should work
2013-06-01 19:46:56	nUbee	ignoring syntax
2013-06-01 19:47:25	User293	if "job to insert" is less than ptr's data, ptr->left = place(job, ptr->left)
2013-06-01 19:47:28	User293	that one?
2013-06-01 19:47:34	User293	oh wrong one!!
2013-06-01 19:47:37	User293	hang on
2013-06-01 19:47:38	nUbee	look at the link I sent
2013-06-01 19:48:09	User293	what link?
2013-06-01 19:48:18	nUbee	look about about 20 lines
2013-06-01 19:48:22	nUbee	above*
2013-06-01 19:48:35	User293	oh i didnt see that
2013-06-01 19:49:12	User293	so then that basically means that i dont need the insert function
2013-06-01 19:49:21	nUbee	you probably do
2013-06-01 19:49:46	nUbee	I'm guessing your insert function (part of your data structure) makes the node to insert
2013-06-01 19:49:57	nUbee	and then your place function places it into the tree
2013-06-01 19:49:59	User293	yeah i copied it into the pastie earlier
2013-06-01 19:50:37	User293	my insert function just calls place, then i wanted place to return back the place to insert, then the insert function just made a new node and put the data all in
2013-06-01 19:51:04	nUbee	I see
2013-06-01 19:51:20	nUbee	than disregard my pastie
2013-06-01 19:51:49	nUbee	you would still return the pointer to the position that the new node will go to
2013-06-01 19:52:06	User293	so as far as i can see, it should work?
2013-06-01 19:52:13	User293	unless theres just something i dont understand
2013-06-01 19:52:36	nUbee	your way works I think, I just didn't think of doing it that way
2013-06-01 19:52:40	User293	oh ok
2013-06-01 19:52:45	User293	i just ran the program and it was okay
2013-06-01 19:52:54	User293	now i have to figure out my remove function!!
2013-06-01 19:52:56	User293	its a doozy
2013-06-01 19:53:03	nUbee	in your case, your insert function calls the place() function and gives insert() the location
2013-06-01 19:53:19	nUbee	hehe, yeah it's pretty complicated
2013-06-01 19:53:23	User293	someone told me that i need like two separate functions just to remove one node from the tree?
2013-06-01 19:53:26	nUbee	but I can give you my algorithm if you'd like
2013-06-01 19:53:34	User293	sure
2013-06-01 19:53:46	nUbee	you probably need 3 functions
2013-06-01 19:53:49	User293	my function apparently doesnt work and is probably all wacked out
2013-06-01 19:53:57	nUbee	one to check if the node to remove is root
2013-06-01 19:54:04	nUbee	another to find the node you want to remove
2013-06-01 19:54:12	nUbee	and a third function to actually remove it
2013-06-01 19:54:27	User293	yeah and link everything back up!!
2013-06-01 19:54:54	nUbee	let me write my remove algorithm
2013-06-01 19:55:10	User293	ok
2013-06-01 20:08:42	nUbee	done phew
2013-06-01 20:09:29	nUbee	http://pastie.org/private/vjil7hhfsvk9vysvskcr3g
2013-06-01 20:10:06	nUbee	the case statements will if/else if/else statements
2013-06-01 20:12:34	User293	holy cow
2013-06-01 20:12:42	nUbee	lol
2013-06-01 20:12:44	nUbee	yeah
2013-06-01 20:13:37	User293	so on the second line it has me remove the node but put an empty node in its place?
2013-06-01 20:13:46	User293	am i understanding that correctly?
2013-06-01 20:14:05	nUbee	that's just defining the function parameters and return type
2013-06-01 20:14:19	nUbee	everything below would be in the remove function
2013-06-01 20:15:17	User293	ohhh
2013-06-01 20:15:45	User293	so at #2, everything else is inside that function
2013-06-01 20:15:50	nUbee	yes
2013-06-01 20:15:59	User293	okay coolio
2013-06-01 20:16:04	User293	thanks! i'll work on it
2013-06-01 20:16:10	nUbee	cool ;)
2013-06-01 20:16:13	User293	the one i tried to write was all one function
2013-06-01 20:17:28	nUbee	I can imagine that would be messy
2013-06-01 20:17:52	User293	oh actually it looks like parts of mine were maybe similar
2013-06-01 20:17:56	User293	just yeah messier

2013-06-02 20:59:02	User292	i'm having problems with my insert function for my bst
2013-06-02 20:59:10	User292	it's overwriting the previous node
2013-06-02 20:59:23	User292	i'm having a hard time understanding why though
2013-06-02 20:59:42	User292	my insert function calls the "place" function [which calls the place to insert]
2013-06-02 20:59:59	User292	and it traverses right or left based on the comparison
2013-06-02 21:00:17	User292	and then when root is null, it returns back to the insert function to put the data in
2013-06-02 21:00:28	User292	should i not be returning the null root, but something else instead??
2013-06-02 21:02:05	User292	should i go until root -> left or right is null?
2013-06-02 21:02:15	User292	then link up in the insert function
2013-06-02 21:03:50	User292	im going to google it, i havent done that yet.
2013-06-02 21:04:16	User292	oh so i do do that

2013-06-02 22:46:18	User649	i have 5 buttons in my app... i want to now which combination of the buttons was simultaneously pressed.... i am confused as to whether use the onTouchListener on the entire view to get all the touches and then figure out which button was pressed or to add a touch handler for each button and then a main handler which figures out which buttons were actually presed... hope my question makes sense to you guys

2013-06-05 08:35:27	+askore	User735: hello, what's your question?
2013-06-05 08:35:45	User735	I'm having an issue in passing by reference and storing to the members of a variable.
2013-06-05 08:36:08	User735	Prototype:    void input_name(photo_info & photo);
2013-06-05 08:36:17	User735	member would be ".name"
2013-06-05 08:36:35	+askore	yes, as in photo.name
2013-06-05 08:36:36	User735	similar to above prototype)
2013-06-05 08:36:39	User735	alsdjfkj
2013-06-05 08:36:44	User735	So the problem is..
2013-06-05 08:37:00	User735	Hrmm, can't do parantehsis it seems..
2013-06-05 08:37:01	User735	at least opening
2013-06-05 08:37:02	User735	anyways
2013-06-05 08:37:12	User735	When I try to pass by reference to another function, similar to above functoin prototype..
2013-06-05 08:37:19	User735	it rewrites the previous member's information
2013-06-05 08:37:28	User735	so second function would be writing to photo.desc
2013-06-05 08:37:36	User735	but it will also rewrite over photo.name with the same information
2013-06-05 08:37:53	+askore	hmmm
2013-06-05 08:38:03	User735	so, if user inputs "bob" for name, and "jim" for description, photo.name and photo.desc both become "jim"
2013-06-05 08:38:16	User735	and it does this for every function that's passed "photo" by reference, similar to above prototype
2013-06-05 08:38:35	+askore	so the function input_name gets a name and then stores it into photo.name
2013-06-05 08:38:52	User735	In theory, and it does--tested with a cout after the function call
2013-06-05 08:38:55	+askore	and you have another function input_desc that gets the description and stores it in photo.desc?
2013-06-05 08:39:08	User735	well it's just passed "photo" by reference, similar to the function above.
2013-06-05 08:39:33	User735	a;ls;ajlsfdlkafsj
2013-06-05 08:39:38	User735	can't do opening parantehsis!
2013-06-05 08:39:43	User735	silly web browser irc
2013-06-05 08:39:49	+askore	heh it's ok you can use the brackets or something and I'll know what you mean
2013-06-05 08:39:52	User735	k
2013-06-05 08:40:13	User735	asd;lfjal;ksdfjakl;sf
2013-06-05 08:40:18	User735	can't do a lot of things in this.
2013-06-05 08:40:19	User735	one sec
2013-06-05 08:40:30	User735	                input_name(photo.name);                 cout << photo.name;                 input_desc(photo.desc);                 cout << photo.name << photo.desc;
2013-06-05 08:40:42	User735	that's my test.
2013-06-05 08:40:52	User735	even if I just pass "photo" instead of "photo.name" etc.
2013-06-05 08:41:07	+askore	hmmm
2013-06-05 08:41:57	+askore	can you show me the code for input_desc?
2013-06-05 08:42:10	User735	Sure. is there easier way to do it than here? Have skype if that's easier.
2013-06-05 08:42:17	User735	Although then it wouldn't be as anonymous O.O
2013-06-05 08:42:50	+askore	it would be easier for you to email the snippets of code to tutors@cs.pdx.edu probably
2013-06-05 08:42:51	User735	also have mIRC but it didn't show #cshelp in the list of channels.
2013-06-05 08:42:58	User735	K, you have access to that?
2013-06-05 08:43:01	+askore	yes
2013-06-05 08:43:14	User735	kk, will e-mail momentarily. Just want to see functions for name/desc?
2013-06-05 08:43:28	+askore	yes please
2013-06-05 08:44:33	User735	ygm therotically
2013-06-05 08:44:50	+askore	indeed!
2013-06-05 08:45:14	User735	so imagine function call is input_name[photo]
2013-06-05 08:45:57	User735	errr
2013-06-05 08:46:01	User735	and name is passed by reference properly
2013-06-05 08:46:08	User735	I was trying to brute force the code to work :D
2013-06-05 08:47:18	User735	I suppose I ought to have sent the struct as well so you could tel me if it was proper.
2013-06-05 08:47:28	+askore	it doesn't look like input_name will work correctly when you pass in photo.name, because it references an object called photo...
2013-06-05 08:47:34	+askore	is photo.name a char *?
2013-06-05 08:47:47	User735	nope, just photo_name photo;
2013-06-05 08:48:01	User735	as far as it's created inside of main.
2013-06-05 08:48:39	+askore	er, in the photo_info struct, the "name" member is what data type?
2013-06-05 08:48:48	User735	char
2013-06-05 08:49:12	+askore	is it dynamically allocated, or statically?
2013-06-05 08:49:21	User735	hrmmmmm........ dunno... should I email the struct?
2013-06-05 08:49:26	+askore	okie dokie
2013-06-05 08:49:29	User735	ty!
2013-06-05 08:49:45	User735	ygm
2013-06-05 08:50:23	User735	I have class otherwise I would have come to the tutors lounge at 11 and thrown myself at the mercy of the tutors in person.
2013-06-05 08:50:50	+askore	ok, so name and desc are statically allocated, so in the struct you need to have a size
2013-06-05 08:50:57	+askore	for example char name[30];
2013-06-05 08:51:01	User735	Had that originally, but it was spitting out errors.
2013-06-05 08:51:43	User735	Instead I was assigning size inside of the functions and it was compiling without errors.
2013-06-05 08:52:11	+askore	 photo.name[30] = ' ';
2013-06-05 08:52:13	+askore	right?
2013-06-05 08:52:15	User735	Yep.
2013-06-05 08:52:39	+askore	I don't think that that is working correctly; all that does is set the 31st character in the array to null

2013-06-05 08:52:52	User735	Yeah, I realized that afterwards
2013-06-05 08:53:03	User735	Hrmm
2013-06-05 08:53:15	User735	Would that be actually causing the error I'm getting though?
2013-06-05 08:53:41	+askore	the problem you're having sounds like a memory issue, so possibly. Have you tried calling input_name after input_desc?
2013-06-05 08:54:06	User735	No. The order of calls is the order of the info in struct
2013-06-05 08:54:26	User735	And if I display after each call, or display at the end, no matter what the final call overwrites all previously stored information
2013-06-05 08:55:04	+askore	only the final one? If you print out name and desc after calling input_name, is desc empty and name has the name?
2013-06-05 08:55:54	User735	So if I call name, feed it information, it displays properly. If I then pass "photo" by reference to desc, and user inputs something [supposedly for photo.desc], when I display it will spit out desc's information for both name and desc
2013-06-05 08:56:23	User735	Test: User inputs Bob for name, cout displays bob. User inputs Jim for desc in next call, cout display jim for name and jim for desc
2013-06-05 08:57:24	+askore	yeah it sounds like desc isn't getting memory allocated properly, so it's using the same memory location for name and desc...
2013-06-05 08:57:48	User735	So how do I fix that problem?
2013-06-05 08:58:44	User735	Like... to my neophyte mind, it looks like it should be working logically...
2013-06-05 08:58:58	+askore	I think if you put sizes in for the arrays in the photo_info struct, it will work better. I can help you work through the errors that come up when you do that.
2013-06-05 08:59:14	User735	Nah, fixed that and it compiles and runs fine
2013-06-05 08:59:33	User735	ooooooo

2013-06-05 17:18:40	MaddHatter	once you know where it is, you usually need to look for off-by-one errors, trying to dereference invalid pointers, and that sort of thing.
2013-06-05 17:19:30	Seanshine	the line thats erring is just an if statement to see if a pointer is NULL
2013-06-05 17:19:40	MaddHatter	what's the if statement?
2013-06-05 17:19:52	Seanshine	if(!root->left && !root->right)
2013-06-05 17:19:56	Seanshine	for my BST
2013-06-05 17:20:03	MaddHatter	that will segfault if root is invalid
2013-06-05 17:20:19	MaddHatter	(because -> is dereferencing root)
2013-06-05 17:20:32	Seanshine	hmm ok
2013-06-05 17:21:41	Seanshine	they were initialized to null by the constructor, does that not make it valid?
2013-06-05 17:22:15	MaddHatter	dereferencing a null pointer is illegal
2013-06-05 17:22:52	MaddHatter	but it's not left and right that are the problem, it's root itself
2013-06-05 17:23:20	Seanshine	ok, that must mean the initial check to set root to a value isn't working
2013-06-05 17:23:21	Seanshine	right?
2013-06-05 17:23:31	Seanshine	i mean my (!root) case
2013-06-05 17:24:08	MaddHatter	probably
2013-06-05 17:24:30	MaddHatter	or it could mean that you set root to something valid, then some other boundary error elsewhere causes it to be overwritten with something invalid.
2013-06-05 17:25:10	Seanshine	that would make more sense
2013-06-05 17:26:03	MaddHatter	you can load up your program in gdb and go step by step, watching the value of root, and see when it gets changed
2013-06-05 17:26:55	Seanshine	I've been trying to do that (however unsuccesfully). I assume the hex values im getting are the addresses?
2013-06-05 17:30:49	Seanshine	ok thanks for your help

2013-06-06 22:04:01	shen	oh..

2013-06-06 22:04:14	shen	wasn't sure how this works..
2013-06-06 22:04:31	nameless	Well, you're in a chat channel on irc. So what's your question?
2013-06-06 22:05:33	shen	It's regarding to create a shell program so that it would find an existing text in my file called "users.ref" and then display specific contents in the file
2013-06-06 22:06:00	nameless	like grep?
2013-06-06 22:06:22	shen	so if I said "lily.brown" or "lily brown," it would be able to out put "lily.brown Lily Brown"
2013-06-06 22:06:24	shen	yes grep
2013-06-06 22:06:58	nameless	Sounds like grep.
2013-06-06 22:07:22	shen	I'm just stuck on how a user would just type a name and then have the program display the line of contents regarding to "lily brown"
2013-06-06 22:07:45	shen	I was thinking that I could create an If else loop
2013-06-06 22:08:26	shen	if grep -qs name /home/student/users.ref
2013-06-06 22:08:54	shen	so this would search for the name or text within users.ref
2013-06-06 22:09:03	nameless	man grep
2013-06-06 22:09:29	nameless	then /Regular Expressions
2013-06-06 22:09:47	nameless	Its like, 60% down the entry.

2013-06-06 22:11:15	shen	oh ok lol
2013-06-06 22:11:29	shen	I guess my first question was too general
2013-06-06 22:11:31	nameless	Mostly because you said unix, which matches a pre-defined highlight pattern I have set, which gets my attention rather fast.
2013-06-06 22:12:07	shen	that's pretty cool how you can do that

2013-06-07 17:01:04	sabreman	I never really figured this out. In c++, what's the best way to set a bunch of meber variables for a class? I want to make them public, but that feels rather silly.
2013-06-07 17:01:18	sabreman	At the same time, having a bunch of settr functions also feels silly
2013-06-07 17:01:54	sabreman	I have a feeling that public is the best way to go, I just wanted to see what you guys think
2013-06-07 17:02:24	kini	I agree
2013-06-07 17:02:24	kini	(note: not a C++ programmer)
2013-06-07 17:02:32	kini	(but getter/setters are the devil)
2013-06-07 17:03:17	sabreman	You know, now that I think about it, I don't think i've seen "offical" standards for this ever.
2013-06-07 17:04:25	pfaffle	sabreman: are you just using it as a data structure?
2013-06-07 17:04:36	+askore	sabreman: if you're setting a whole bunch in one fell swoop, you could create a function for modifying them all at once
2013-06-07 17:04:48	+askore	and have the function be public in the class
2013-06-07 17:05:12	 *	pfaffle thinks "best way" really depends on what the use case is
2013-06-07 17:05:43	sabreman	So, I think this is what im gonna do
2013-06-07 17:05:58	sabreman	i'll make duplicates of the vars that I want to change (like 10) and make them public
2013-06-07 17:06:18	sabreman	then every update I'll run a sanity check function that will make sure their values are allright
2013-06-07 17:06:23	sabreman	and do any nessesary adjustments
2013-06-07 17:06:35	sabreman	Best way I could come up with.
2013-06-07 18:19:29	kini	if you need to validate these things you should be using getters and setters
2013-06-07 18:19:40	kini	what will your sanity check function do if the values aren't allright
2013-06-07 18:19:49	kini	by that point it's too late to cause some kind of error condition in whatever code actually set those values
2013-06-07 20:03:11	MaddHatter	if you need to be doing sanity checks, then you should create functions to get/set those values
2013-06-07 20:03:41	MaddHatter	(this is where dynamic languages really shine, but alas, cpp is what we have)
2013-06-07 20:06:09	sabreman	I jsut decided to go with pulbic values
2013-06-07 20:06:10	MaddHatter	if you have a lot of them, you could store it as a map and expose SetProperty(string name, type value) and GetProperty(string name) for set/get
2013-06-07 20:06:22	sabreman	this is something that I'll be using only in thios project for now, and not a library

2013-06-10 20:08:03	User087	Hello. Is there a tutor available to help with a 162 question?
2013-06-10 20:11:18	nightfly	maybe, go ahead and ask. :)
2013-06-10 20:12:10	User087	wellllllllll I'm getting some really fun looking errors and I was hoping to gnab some help for a few minutes to figure out exactly why I feel.... confused.
2013-06-10 20:13:33	User087	for example, int resp; gives me the error: main.cpp:21: error: new types may not be defined in a return type main.cpp:21: error: extraneous `int' ignored main.cpp:21: error: `main' must return `int'
2013-06-10 20:18:22	User087	hrrrrrrmmmmm I'll just go back to teh gewglez. ty though!
2013-06-10 20:18:33	pfaffle	there is likely more to it than just that one line of code
2013-06-10 20:18:43	User087	yeaaaaah... there's a lot more errors.
2013-06-10 20:18:56	User087	Guess it's just some minor syntax stuffs....
2013-06-10 20:19:07	pfaffle	i'd start by making sure you've got ; at the end of each statement
2013-06-10 20:19:20	pfaffle	and making sure you have a return statement at the end of main which returns an int
2013-06-10 20:19:29	pfaffle	that'll clear up one o fthose errors
2013-06-10 20:19:32	User087	I do. That's at the beginning of the function.
2013-06-10 20:19:44	User087	That error is actually at the very first {
2013-06-10 20:19:54	@krinkle	could you copy and paste line 21 of main.cpp here?
2013-06-10 20:20:04	User087	hehe, it's literally just {
2013-06-10 20:20:09	@krinkle	ah
2013-06-10 20:20:20	@krinkle	what's the line above it?
2013-06-10 20:20:24	User087	I can't type paranthesis in here...
2013-06-10 20:20:27	User087	it's just the main header
2013-06-10 20:20:31	User087	int main
2013-06-10 20:20:36	User087	with paranthesis
2013-06-10 20:22:11	@krinkle	are you including any header files? did you make sure your structs and classes end with a ; ?
2013-06-10 20:22:54	User087	...... .....
2013-06-10 20:23:02	User087	so that error is gone
2013-06-10 20:23:02	User087	:D
2013-06-10 20:23:06	@krinkle	woot
2013-06-10 20:23:08	User087	forgot the ; at end of class
2013-06-10 20:23:14	User087	now just the meet of the errors is left.
2013-06-10 20:23:27	User087	and that's just my lack of understanding of classes/pointers I think....
2013-06-10 20:26:11	User087	May I ask another question?
2013-06-10 20:26:12	User087	:)
2013-06-10 20:26:35	@krinkle	of course
2013-06-10 20:26:44	@krinkle	(it's best to just ask the question rather than asking to ask)
2013-06-10 20:27:09	@krinkle	(that way shy people are more likely to speak up and help out)
2013-06-10 20:27:19	User087	So let's say I have a class "class" and a struct "struct".   if I want class to have member of an array of structs, what would the syntax look like?
2013-06-10 20:27:55	User087	Sometimes you're only granted so many questions. Seems more polite to ask if you're allowed to ask.
2013-06-10 20:28:16	User087	err... maybe my lingo is wrong..
2013-06-10 20:29:38	User087	so in defining the private data of "class" I want to have an array of "struct"...
2013-06-10 20:30:05	User087	would that look like struct * var[number];?
2013-06-10 20:31:28	@krinkle	well, calling your class "class" and your struct "struct" is illegal and very confusing, let's call them my_class and my_struct
2013-06-10 20:31:58	User087	Sure.
2013-06-10 20:32:01	@krinkle	then your data declaration would look like my_struct var[number]; (for a statically allocated array of my_struct)
2013-06-10 20:32:22	User087	and if I wanted to do dynamically?
2013-06-10 20:32:26	@krinkle	or my_struct * var;
2013-06-10 20:33:01	User087	okay... that's what I thought...
2013-06-10 20:33:15	User087	and then onnnne last question....
2013-06-10 20:33:30	@krinkle	shoot
2013-06-10 20:34:00	User087	al;sjdflkajdsf silly parnthesis... imagine that [] = paranthesis
2013-06-10 20:34:18	@krinkle	okay
2013-06-10 20:34:48	User087	in the my_class[] default constructor, if I wanted the user to set the total of the array, would it be my_struct * var[x]?
2013-06-10 20:35:25	@krinkle	to allocate memory for your array you will need to use the new operator
2013-06-10 20:35:36	User087	err,l yeah, sry
2013-06-10 20:35:39	User087	I misread my own code -.-
2013-06-10 20:35:45	@krinkle	which will look like var = new my_struct[size];
2013-06-10 20:35:52	User087	Ohhhhhhhh
2013-06-10 20:37:38	User087	hrmm.... okay, I think that's everything! :D
2013-06-10 20:37:46	@krinkle	cool
2013-06-10 20:38:12	User087	Oh... wait... well... I mean... just out of curiousity sake...
2013-06-10 20:40:45	User087	What does: script::~script()                   /var/tmp//ccMMdz8E.o ld: fatal: symbol referencing errors. No output written to a.out collect2: ld returned 1 exit status          mean?
2013-06-10 20:41:50	User087	or, one line at a time...
2013-06-10 20:41:55	@krinkle	ld is the linker, which means that gcc got past checking your syntax and is now trying to link your .cpp and .h files
2013-06-10 20:42:04	User087	oh..
2013-06-10 20:42:22	@krinkle	it's probably saying that it either didn't find ~script in your header file or in your .cpp file
2013-06-10 20:42:37	User087	hrmmm... it's there..... ~script[];
2013-06-10 20:42:41	User087	with paranthesis
2013-06-10 20:42:55	User087	                script();                 ~script();
2013-06-10 20:42:56	User087	2 lines
2013-06-10 20:43:05	User087	in header
2013-06-10 20:43:51	kini	[2013-06-10 20:26:44] <krinkle> (it's best to just ask the question rather than asking to ask)
2013-06-10 20:43:51	kini	[2013-06-10 20:27:09] <krinkle> (that way shy people are more likely to speak up and help out)
2013-06-10 20:43:51	kini	besides that, it also reduces time lag - a common pattern in IRC channels is like, A: hey can I ask a question? [an hour passes] B: sure, go ahead [an hour passes] A: oh, didn't see your response, my question was ____ B: *pings out*
2013-06-10 20:43:51	kini	it's just good network protocol design :P why make your opening handshake any longer than it needs to be?
2013-06-10 20:44:25	@krinkle	kini: thanks :)
2013-06-10 20:44:34	@krinkle	User087: did you define your destructor in a .cpp file?
2013-06-10 20:44:55	User087	No. Didn't know I needed to. Hrmm
2013-06-10 20:45:13	@krinkle	If you say it exists in your header file then c++ expects you to follow through with your promise
2013-06-10 20:45:33	User087	Hrmmmm.... I have 0 ideas what it should look like. Time to google!
2013-06-10 20:46:29	@krinkle	to clear the error you can just put script::~script(){} somewhere in your file, but karla will have examples in her notes of destructors depending on what type of data structure you're using

2013-06-11 12:13:13	User464	ug
2013-06-11 12:13:47	User464	in a adjacency list does an edge acutually hold a vertex struct, or just a pointer
2013-06-11 12:14:03	User464	to a vertex held in the adjacency list?
2013-06-11 12:18:08	drbop	Edges should hold a pointer to a vertex since there could be multiple edges pointing to the same vertex.
2013-06-11 12:18:37	drbop	Or if the vertices are held in an array, the edge could just hold the index of the vertex.

2013-06-25 20:37:20	Wren	putty is a windows-only utility. If you wish to SSH to remote servers on a mac you can use the terminal app included with mac os
2013-06-25 20:37:20	blkperl	skye: you don't need putty on a mac
2013-06-25 20:37:31	blkperl	ah. wren beat me too it
2013-06-25 20:38:18	skye	okay. im in the cs 102 class for c++. i need to access unix because thats what were using in the class. when i enter my username and cs.pdx.edu into terminal it asks for my password but i cant type anything in.
2013-06-25 20:38:27	skye	is this a password that i got from cat last term? what if i dont know it?
2013-06-25 20:39:20	Wren	When you type your password into terminal applications, they generally do not output text into the window
2013-06-25 20:39:36	Wren	That is, it will not appear that you are typing anything, but you are.
2013-06-25 20:40:12	skye	oh. okay. so, it is the pdx password that i got from cat before?
2013-06-25 20:40:18	Wren	yes
2013-06-25 20:40:24	skye	gah, i cant remember it. ill just go and get a new one from you guys tomorrow?
2013-06-25 20:40:42	Wren	That works. We are open from 8am to 6pm.

2013-06-26 13:33:59	User849	I started reading the book" Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner" and the end of the first chapter speaks of making your program run by double-clicking its icon, but they never explained what you do to run the program that way.  You can run it in the interactive shell environment, you can run it in the script window, but how do you set it up to run by clicking on an icon?
2013-06-26 13:34:51	User849	Clicking on the icon of the document you've saved merely brings up your script window.

2013-06-26 13:58:59	retrov	there's a dropdown list in the small window that comes up that lets you pick which program will open the script
2013-06-26 13:59:29	retrov	the python interpreter should be in that list. there's also a check box below the list that sets the program you pick to be the default for all files of the same type

2013-06-26 14:05:40	User849	Is the python interpreter the "Python Launcher"?
2013-06-26 14:07:20	User849	Python Launcher opens it, but the book was trying to get you to see the difference between a program that merely had the print function with no request for input, which supposedly makes the window flash briefly before disappearing, because the student was supposed to use the input function to make the console stay open.
2013-06-26 14:07:58	User849	Python Launcher keeps some sort of console open no matter what you do.
2013-06-26 14:08:21	pfaffle	heh
2013-06-26 14:08:50	User849	But maybe the book is outdated or incorrect as far the Mac is concerned?
2013-06-26 14:09:04	pfaffle	yeah, I'd say that's likely
2013-06-26 14:10:21	User849	K, thanks.
2013-06-26 14:13:09	User849	The book has the following example:  print ('Program "Game Over" 2.0')
2013-06-26 14:13:12	User849	print ('Program "Game Over" 2.0')  print ('Same', 'message', 'as before')

2013-06-26 14:15:23	User849	Seems like it wants you not to use the print function twice in a row, but the book says it should work.
2013-06-26 14:21:28	kini	User849: each statement should be on a separate line in python
2013-06-26 14:21:53	kini	if you put two print statements on one line it tries to read it as one statement but can't
2013-06-26 14:24:05	User849	I had them on separate lines in Python.  Though I didn't know that either, that it would have rejected statements on the same line.
2013-06-26 14:25:02	pfaffle	maybe it's the space between print and ( ?
2013-06-26 14:25:21	kini	that shouldn't really matter (in python 2 anyway)
2013-06-26 14:25:29	kini	it'll print something different but it'll still print
2013-06-26 14:25:45	User849	I deleted the space, but get the same syntax error.
2013-06-26 14:25:51	kini	or wait, I guess it'll print the same thing
2013-06-26 14:26:01	kini	User849: what's your exact code and what's the exact error you get?
2013-06-26 14:26:28	User849	print('Program "Game Over" 2.0')

2013-06-26 14:27:31	pfaffle	does the second print statement have an indent in front of it like you've got there?
2013-06-26 14:27:55	User849	no indent.  It's not large.
2013-06-26 14:28:13	User849	It's chapter one stuff for beginners.
2013-06-26 14:28:23	kini	pfaffle: the indent looks wrong but it wouldn't produce that error message

2013-06-26 16:30:32	User742	I don't understand the continuation character, i.e. the backslash.  I'm using a mac, running an extremely simple print function as a beginner exercise.  It says you use the backslash to stretch a single statement across multiple lines.  I can take out the backslashes or leave them in without affecting the output of the program.  What am I misunderstanding?
2013-06-26 16:31:33	User742	Here's the first part of the exercise:
2013-06-26 16:31:38	User742	print("\nThis string " + "may not " + "seem terr" + "ibly impressive. "\       + "But what " + "you don't know " + "is that \n" + "it's one real" \       + "l" + "y" + " long string,")
2013-06-26 16:32:12	User742	If I delete those backslashes, the program runs just the same as if they were there.
2013-06-26 16:32:54	User742	So what are they supposed to be doing?
2013-06-26 16:33:25	haus	User742: the line continuation matters if your print spans multiple lines
2013-06-26 16:33:34	haus	User742: like print("\nThis string " + "may not " + "seem terr" + "ibly impressive. "\

2013-06-26 16:42:15	User742	In the place where I wrote the code, I hit enter a couple times and it spans three lines.  But the backslashes are not necessary.  The code does the same thing without them.
2013-06-26 16:44:36	User742	I wrote the following, hitting the enter key after each line:
2013-06-26 16:44:40	User742	print("\nThis string " + "may not " + "seem terr" + "ibly impressive. "
2013-06-26 16:44:52	User742	 + "But what " + "you don't know " + "is that \n" + "it's one real"

2013-06-26 16:46:01	User742	In the Python exercise, you're supposed to follow each of these lines by a backslash, but it doesn't affect the outcome.
2013-06-26 16:46:10	User742	So I don't get it.
2013-06-26 16:46:36	User742	This was four lines instead of the previous three.

2013-06-26 16:50:17	kini	"Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation."
2013-06-26 16:50:50	User742	O.K.  Frustrating when the textbook misleads me.  Thanks.
2013-06-26 16:51:03	kini	yeah I'm a bit surprised, Bart said that book was very good
2013-06-26 16:51:51	kini	btw the main reason the continuation backslash is not recommended is that if you put a space after it it breaks
2013-06-26 16:51:51	kini	and in most text editors you can't just glance at it and tell whether there's a space after it or not
2013-06-26 16:53:23	kini	User742: as you probably figured out by now, the () you used with the print statement count as "wrapping expressions in parentheses" as mentioned in the quote I pasted
2013-06-26 16:53:40	kini	which is why you don't need the backslashes in your example, as wrapping expressions in parentheses is another way to split statements over multiple lines

2013-06-26 19:57:01	User111	I tried to run a tiny Python program [on a mac] that was supposed to demonstrate the use of variables.  I don't understand why it worked when it displayed it on the Shell, but not when I ran it through the Python launcher.  It said the variable was not defined.
2013-06-26 19:57:59	User111	It looked like this:  name = input("Hi.  What's your name?  ")  print(name)  input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
2013-06-26 19:58:57	User111	But the terminal - bash thing said     name = input("Hi.  What's your name?  ")   File "<string>", line 1, in <module> NameError: name 'Bob' is not defined
2013-06-26 19:59:38	User111	After entering "Bob" it doesn't work.
2013-06-26 20:00:09	kini	you want raw_input, not input
2013-06-26 20:00:24	kini	either that or you need to type Bob in quotes when entering it
2013-06-26 20:00:41	kini	I mean, it's the same problem, but those are two ways to solve it
2013-06-26 20:00:56	kini	input() allows you to enter python expressions, whereas raw_input() allows you to enter strings only
2013-06-26 20:02:47	User111	That was the example from the book.  It didn't use raw_input.  And why did it work in the shell thing?
2013-06-26 20:04:12	User111	raw_input doesn't seem to be working in this context.
2013-06-26 20:04:13	kini	it shouldn't have, unless you typed Bob in quotation marks
2013-06-26 20:05:41	User111	I didn't type the variable in quotation marks.
2013-06-26 20:10:23	User111	But yeah, it works with quotation marks.
2013-06-26 20:11:01	User111	That is, if the user puts quotation marks around his own name, then it works.  But that's not what they did in the books example.
2013-06-26 20:13:02	@krinkle	it's a difference between python2.7 and python3
2013-06-26 20:13:31	@krinkle	it should work the way you want it to if you make sure you're using python3
2013-06-26 20:14:34	User111	It's Python 3 something.  I wonder if it's a mac problem.  I had to download some activeTcl thing to make it even work.
2013-06-26 20:15:48	@krinkle	shouldn't be too different on mac
2013-06-26 20:15:52	User111	That is, Python 3 required an extra download for mac.
2013-06-26 20:15:59	@krinkle	ah
2013-06-26 20:16:59	@krinkle	well I think your command line is using python3 and your launcher is for some reason using python2

2013-07-03 12:42:47	Racoon	throw it in pastebin and post it here and tutors can check it out
2013-07-03 12:43:39	Racoon	whoops just read that fully
2013-07-03 12:43:46	Racoon	glad to hear it works
2013-07-03 12:44:40	User847	Thanks, I might be throwing it in the bin anyway, since I still haven't figured out why it doesn't work after I take the comment markers off.

2013-07-03 12:48:15	User847	According to a book on Python, you're supposed to be able to concatenate tuples, right?  So if "inventory" is a tuple and "chest" is a tuple, I should be able to write inventory += chest.  Right?  The book does that, but it seems to be causing a syntax error for me.
2013-07-03 12:50:53	Racoon	no i dont believe you are allowed to concatenate tuples
2013-07-03 12:51:06	User847	I put it in the bin under tuple problem.
2013-07-03 12:51:07	Racoon	lists however can be concatenated
2013-07-03 12:51:35	sabreman	put the adresss to the paste here
2013-07-03 12:51:40	sabreman	so we can see it
2013-07-03 12:52:36	Racoon	tuples are bounded to their initial size
2013-07-03 12:52:44	User847	You mean this?: http://pastebin.com/x7npsPjB
2013-07-03 12:53:20	Racoon	for instance if I write a funtion that takes a twoTuple as an argument, then it'll break on a three or four or nTuple
2013-07-03 12:54:19	sabreman	yea, you sohuld just use lists instead.
2013-07-03 12:54:39	sabreman	unless you REALLY need tuples, lists are better 99% of the time (And can be used in a wider range of situations)
2013-07-03 12:55:25	kini	lol tuples and lists in python
2013-07-03 12:55:53	User847	Mmmh.  I was just following the book's example.  Lists come in the next chapter.
2013-07-03 12:57:07	User847	I'll keep reading.  Thanks.
2013-07-03 12:57:33	Racoon	User847: I was corrected
2013-07-03 12:58:09	Racoon	Im told that you can pass tuples into functions regardless of their size
2013-07-03 12:59:05	kini	Racoon were you thinking of Haskell tuples :P
2013-07-03 12:59:16	Racoon	kini: maybe
2013-07-03 12:59:22	Racoon	:)
2013-07-03 12:59:36	kini	<sabreman> unless you REALLY need tuples, lists are better 99% of the time (And can be used in a wider range of situations)
2013-07-03 12:59:36	kini	I think tuples are immutable so you might be able to save a bit on memory by using them
2013-07-03 12:59:43	kini	but beginners probably don't want to be worrying about that kind of stuff
2013-07-03 13:00:24	kini	well, might be useful for safety reasons too but probably even the concept of using compile-time guarantees to stave off programming error is foreign to the pythonic ideal :P
2013-07-03 13:00:25	sabreman	Yea I don't think beginners should need to worry aobut memory. 
2013-07-03 13:02:41	User847	Still mystified as to why it didn't work, but I guess I'll drop it and go on to lists.
2013-07-03 13:02:52	stormcrow	User847: it looks like you're having issues with python 2 versus python 3
2013-07-03 13:03:13	stormcrow	the code you provided works great when I run it in python 3, but crashes in python 2
2013-07-03 13:03:49	stormcrow	It sounds like the book is assuming python 3
2013-07-03 13:03:55	User847	That's not the first time I've heard that.  I think it's something to do with it being Python for mac, because it says it's Python 3.
2013-07-03 13:04:15	User847	Does that sound likely?
2013-07-03 13:04:17	stormcrow	hmm, how are you running python?
2013-07-03 13:04:43	stormcrow	are you typing `python` in the terminal, or something else?
2013-07-03 13:05:38	User847	Oh, I gave up running things in the pyrhon launcher, after three or four things didn't work in the launcher but they worked in the shell.
2013-07-03 13:05:51	User847	But this tuple question is not in the launcher.
2013-07-03 13:06:10	kini	what is a python launcher
2013-07-03 13:06:34	stormcrow	try using `python3` (without the back ticks) in the shell
2013-07-03 13:07:14	User847	Python launcher?  I probably don't know the right jargon.  But it seems to be the thing you run your final program in on a mac.
2013-07-03 13:07:37	User847	I assumed that's what was meant by terminal.
2013-07-03 13:08:04	kini	terminal means... terminal
2013-07-03 13:08:09	kini	isn't there a program called Terminal on your mac?
2013-07-03 13:08:43	+askore	User847: is the python launcher IDLE?
2013-07-03 13:09:06	User847	The python folder I downloaded comes with IDLE, documentation, Python Launcher, and Update something or other.
2013-07-03 13:09:31	+askore	so the python launcher is a part of IDLE. Terminal is a program on your Mac that you can run commands from.
2013-07-03 13:09:33	User847	Yeah a terminal thing comes up when I run something through the launcher.
2013-07-03 13:10:05	+askore	yes, however that terminal is still part of idle. If your code doesn't behave properly when you run it from a file versus from the IDLE terminal, the problem is likely with your cide.
2013-07-03 13:10:07	+askore	*code.
2013-07-03 13:15:24	User847	Hmm.  There are simple programs that run through the shell thing, but not through the terminal.  I'd be surprised if it was the code.
2013-07-03 13:15:46	User847	I was just checking a couple of them to remind myself what happens.
2013-07-03 13:16:48	User847	To <askore>:  You get dubious syntax errors in the terminal when it runs fine in the shell.
2013-07-03 13:18:10	User847	I bet I could run all of them fine on Windows.
2013-07-03 13:18:16	stormcrow	User847: when you say "shell", what exactly do you mean? how do you open it?
2013-07-03 13:18:38	stormcrow	same questions with "terminal"
2013-07-03 13:18:55	User847	I open it through IDLE.
2013-07-03 13:19:05	User847	So I guess I should say IDLE instead of shell?
2013-07-03 13:19:22	User847	It says shell at the top of the window.
2013-07-03 13:19:35	User847	And the book said shell more often.
2013-07-03 13:20:23	User847	I click on idle and that shell window comes up.  Then I click new window to start writing the program.
2013-07-03 13:20:31	stormcrow	and "terminal"? how are you getting to that?
2013-07-03 13:20:49	User847	I get terminal through Python launcher.
2013-07-03 13:21:11	sabreman	yea that seems right
2013-07-03 13:22:21	User847	So, a few simple programs worked through IDLE, but not through Python Launcher, the terminal.
2013-07-03 13:22:37	User847	Which I assume is only a mac problem for Python 3 right now.
2013-07-03 13:23:18	User847	And what started this conversation was that someone suggested that the problem with tuples might be due to using Python 2.
2013-07-03 13:23:45	User847	But it says Python 3, so maybe there are problems in IDLE on the mac as well.
2013-07-03 13:24:05	stormcrow	it looks like the problem isn't in concatting tuples in python, but in how input is used in python 2 versus python 3
2013-07-03 13:25:49	sabreman	User847: 
2013-07-03 13:25:54	User847	And is it possible that the mac version of Python 3 still has some Python 2 stuff in it?
2013-07-03 13:25:55	sabreman	i figured out what happened
2013-07-03 13:26:04	sabreman	there is a random charecter at the end of the += line
2013-07-03 13:26:13	sabreman	that doesnt show up in normal editors (it did for me in vim)
2013-07-03 13:26:23	sabreman	delete and retype that line (dont copy/paste)
2013-07-03 13:26:26	sabreman	it should fix it
2013-07-03 13:26:52	sabreman	make sure to totaly delete it (including the carriage return)
2013-07-03 13:27:46	User847	Thanks.  I'll try that.
2013-07-03 13:28:21	User847	Why would there be a random character that I couldn't see by looking at the original code?
2013-07-03 13:28:27	sabreman	i have no idea
2013-07-03 13:28:36	sabreman	some sort of file corruption?
2013-07-03 13:31:18	User847	Wonderful it works.  Thanks a lot.
2013-07-03 13:31:28	sabreman	apperantly it's an escape sequince for "Data link escape"
2013-07-03 13:31:37	sabreman	i have no clue how that got in
2013-07-03 13:31:41	sabreman	anyway, no problem
2013-07-03 13:33:57	kini	data link escape? wtf...

2014-07-05 20:47:11	seibert	In object oriented programming, how would you define that one class is a collection of another class? In Karlas lab she has a namespace collection { //class constructs }, is that what this is? I havent been able to find any information about a 'collection' keyword or anything to tell me otherwise
2014-07-05 20:49:08	ryan	seibert: is there only one specific class it would ever be a collection of? or does it need to support being a collect of different types of classes within it?
2014-07-05 20:52:19	seibert	I believe it will need to be a collection of different types of classes, not just one.
2014-07-05 20:52:26	seibert	But starting with one wouldnt be bad either =D
2014-07-05 20:54:08	ryan	seibert: class templates might be helpful, towards the end of this page: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/
2014-07-05 20:54:48	ryan	unless all of the classes it would contain would be subclasses of the same base class. I wish I knew more about Karlas labs, sorry. :(
2014-07-05 20:55:48	seibert	Its okay! Thank you for the help, I will read through that tutorial and continue to research =)

2014-07-07 20:02:38	seibert	What is the best way to shuffle a deck of cards? I am hesitant to use the random_shuffle function since we have not been taught nor used Vectors whatsoever in our classes
2014-07-07 20:03:07	seibert	Our classes meaning Karlas classes. Not a C++ class =D
2014-07-07 20:24:09	+relsqui	that's actually kind of a complicated question :) can you be more specific about what it's for?
2014-07-07 20:24:18	+relsqui	if it's a karla class but not a C++ class, does that mean 161?
2014-07-07 20:24:24	Krampus	seibert: there is an actual random_shuffle template in the standard lib.
2014-07-07 20:29:11	seibert	No no it is in a C++ class. I was trying to clarify what I was refering to but made it more confusing.
2014-07-07 20:29:54	seibert	I found random_shuffle in our book (C++ Primer Plus) but thought that it was a vector opperation.
2014-07-07 20:30:28	+relsqui	if you want an actual algorithm, there's this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm

2014-08-01 22:52:06	seibert	Has anyone installed Eclipse 4.4 on Debian?
2014-08-01 22:52:24	seibert	Synaptic only has 3.8 and I am having trouble getting 4.4 to work with JDK
2014-08-02 01:08:50	seibert	Im building BSTs in C++ for practice trying to get a random tree of ints and for some reason it keeps coming out the exact same. Same number of items, same order, same data
2014-08-02 01:19:59	+relsqui	are you seeding the random number generator with srand()? :)
2014-08-02 01:21:38	seibert	My build function uses rand() modded by an int along with a for loop to iterate through, passing another rand() int into the insert function
2014-08-02 01:21:47	seibert	Should I be using srand() instead?
2014-08-02 01:33:14	seibert	My build function looks like:
2014-08-02 01:33:37	seibert	int max_size(rand() % 23);
2014-08-02 01:34:02	seibert	for (int i=0; i<max_size; ++i) {
2014-08-02 01:34:22	seibert	int to_add(rand() % 100);
2014-08-02 01:34:39	seibert	insert (root, to_add); }
2014-08-02 01:34:46	seibert	Anything I am missing??
2014-08-02 02:10:35	+relsqui	ack, sorry, was in another window
2014-08-02 02:11:06	+relsqui	seibert: you don't use srand() instead; you use srand() once, in addition, somewhere at the beginning of your program (early in main is usually a good choice)
2014-08-02 02:11:30	+relsqui	you can check out the documentation for more details, but essentially it "seeds" the random number generator, gives it a starting place to generate pseudorandomness from
2014-08-02 02:12:56	+relsqui	if you don't do that, it will always start from the same place, so you'll always get the same "random" numbers
2014-08-02 02:13:09	+relsqui	(this is because the random numbers most computers generate aren't really random, because real randomness is really hard)
2014-08-02 02:13:49	seibert	Oh cool, never knew that. Thank you!! I will try it out
2014-08-02 02:23:25	+relsqui	welcome!

2014-08-05 10:43:55	sion	I can ssh into it
2014-08-05 10:44:18	+askore	after you ssh into it you can start a vnc session, and use a vnc client to connect to it

2014-08-05 11:01:24	sion	sokam
2014-08-05 11:01:52	sion	i open the vncserver on chatham
2014-08-05 11:03:08	+askore	then you point your vnc client at chatham, on the port the vncserver gave you?
2014-08-05 11:04:38	sion	I did. but I was wondering what port I need for my local computer. The first port number in the ssh cmd line list in the tutorial site.
2014-08-05 11:05:20	+askore	so when you started the server, what exactly did it say to you?
2014-08-05 11:05:23	+askore	like "New 'X

2014-08-05 11:05:40	sion	chatham:2
2014-08-05 11:05:51	+askore	so the port you need is chatham:5902
2014-08-05 11:06:04	+askore	so do vncviewer chatham.cs.pdx.edu:5902
2014-08-05 11:06:47	+askore	oh, right - you need to do the ssh tunnel too
2014-08-05 11:06:49	+askore	I see what you're asking
2014-08-05 11:07:35	+askore	so you can use 5902 on your computer as well, or you can pick whatever port you want
2014-08-05 11:08:46	sion	so here is my cmd. ssh sokam@eve.ece.pdx.edu -L 5944:localhost:5902
2014-08-05 11:08:59	sion	and I got the connection close message
2014-08-05 11:09:51	+askore	not eve, you need to put chatham
2014-08-05 11:11:14	sion	ok. I login in terminal. How would I get the remote desktop?
2014-08-05 11:12:12	+askore	on your laptop you open a vnc client, usually by typing "vncviewer" in the terminal
2014-08-05 11:16:22	sion	work on my linux box. Thanks. I need to install vnc on my mac.
2014-08-05 11:17:07	+askore	ahh, yeah I don't use macs so I wasn't sure what the vnc client would be there

2014-08-07 11:09:40	brodie_	(C++ , CS202) is it possible to initialize an object within a switch statement? i keep getting compiler errors about cross initialization
2014-08-07 11:09:53	brodie_	the object is only init’d once in case 1
2014-08-07 11:10:41	+mancat	to iniialize it?
2014-08-07 11:10:46	+mancat	i don't see why not
2014-08-07 11:10:48	+askore	brodie_: you can do it if you initialize the object in every case of the switch statement, otherwise it might try to get used uninitialized later
2014-08-07 11:10:55	+mancat	^
2014-08-07 11:11:24	+mancat	but the compiler shouldn't stop you in any case
2014-08-07 11:11:24	+askore	(if your case statement falls through in some cases, have fun with if statements I guess)
2014-08-07 11:11:34	+mancat	you might just get bad behavior later
2014-08-07 11:11:34	+askore	mancat: actually I do think that that will cause compile errors
2014-08-07 11:11:40	+mancat	really?
2014-08-07 11:12:02	+askore	well you definitely get them if you declare the variable in the case
2014-08-07 11:12:10	+askore	initialize, maybe/probably
2014-08-07 11:12:21	+mancat	sure, that makes sense wih declaration
2014-08-07 11:12:46	+mancat	but the compiler doesn't have a concept of iniialization except for at delaraion time
2014-08-07 11:12:56	+mancat	*declaration

2014-08-07 14:07:38	MaddHatter	declaration means the compiler has to allocate memory, and it can't conditionally compile a memory slot based on something that may or may not happen at runtime. Initialization doesn't have to be decided at compile-time.

2014-08-08 21:52:54	brodie_	(java) so, i'm trying to create a class with a "has a" relationship with another class and it
2014-08-08 21:53:02	brodie_	it's derived classes
2014-08-08 21:54:18	brodie_	i can call the class and create the objects in the Main class, but not from another, separate class
2014-08-08 21:55:29	dondon	... isn't that more along the lines of a private interface rather than class?
2014-08-08 21:56:02	brodie_	i'm not following
2014-08-08 22:00:35	dondon	brodie_: oh sorry, read that wrong. let's see... so you've got class1 and class2 extends class1 right?
2014-08-08 22:01:04	dondon	over in main you can make class1 and class2 objects, but not somewhere else?
2014-08-08 22:01:21	brodie_	yeah
2014-08-08 22:01:42	brodie_	i want to be able create another class that can manage the base class and it's derived classes
2014-08-08 22:01:52	dondon	sounds like the somewhere else isn't in the same package, or doesn't import the class1 & 2
2014-08-08 22:02:22	brodie_	so, i would need to import the base class and all of it's derived classes?
2014-08-08 22:02:22	dondon	brodie_: define "manage" ?
2014-08-08 22:02:45	dondon	if they are in the same folder it should already work

2014-09-18 16:52:33	User404	yep that's right!
2014-09-18 16:53:27	User404	for the tree: T(n) = T(3n/7) + T(4n/7) +3n
2014-09-18 16:54:53	User404	I need to prove that T(n) = Omega(n*log 7 n)
2014-09-18 16:54:59	User404	7 is the base of the log

2014-09-18 22:52:00	ryan	...does anybody know about User404's recursion trees? I'm kind of interested to find out what a correct answer would have looked like. and mostly confused.
2014-09-18 23:07:08	nightfly	At first I thought they were a slightly confused early cs student. -_- I'm really not sure how you'd visualize it, and/or how that would help show that it converges on the formula they showed
2014-09-19 01:51:42	+kendall	recursion trees are related to proving the master theorem; not something I'd expect an undergrad to have to deal with.
2014-09-19 01:53:36	+kendall	(actully hmm they may also be a more general method for solving complex recurrences with multiple different recursive calls, but also yeah you typically don't see that kind of complex recurrence in cs350)

2014-10-01 13:21:19	dondon	amillan: staff and other people, just ask your question and we will try to answer it.
2014-10-01 13:22:47	amillan	Remote Desktop Connection doesn't connect to Linux systems, correct? Only PC? I've tried to access a Linux system through my terminal, but when prompted for my password, its like the terminal freezes so I'm unable to type anything. Making me unable to login to the OS. Any way to get around this?
2014-10-01 13:23:53	amillan	I can access PC without a problem, just not Linux through the Remote Desktop Connection OR my terminal
2014-10-01 13:23:55	Krampus	amillan: you can do x-server forwarding, vnc, etc.
2014-10-01 13:23:56	dondon	amillan: you would have to install a remote desktop server on the linux machine you wanted to get to, and start it
2014-10-01 13:24:26	dondon	amillan: the terminal should work, Care to describe how you tried to connect?
2014-10-01 13:24:36	Krampus	as far as the desktop itself, you have to use something like... vino I think it's called?
2014-10-01 13:25:34	amillan	To connect to the linux server, I wrote "ssh linux.cecs.pdx.edu". Then it prompts me for a password, which I'm unable to write for some reason
2014-10-01 13:25:48	Krampus	amillan: it won't echo it back.
2014-10-01 13:26:02	dondon	amillan: you have to give it amillan@linux.cecs.pdx.edu or whatever your username is
2014-10-01 13:26:28	Krampus	amillan: also, you can do something like ssh -X linux.cecs.pdx.edu, which would let you run apps on the server you've connected to but have the output redirect to your local.
2014-10-01 13:26:31	dondon	ah, it isn't going to put stars or something in the box, just finish the password and hit enter
2014-10-01 13:28:50	amillan	Oh!
2014-10-01 13:28:56	amillan	Ok yeah it works
2014-10-01 13:29:19	amillan	Now I have access to PC and Linux. There isn't an interface for the Linux server is there? Only through terminal?
2014-10-01 13:30:35	dondon	amillan: there are, we have instructions for several kinds on cat.pdx.edu
2014-10-01 13:30:45	amillan	Ok thanks. Ill check it out

2014-10-03 17:23:06	patrick	hey, i am trying to compile some code using vs2012 on ts.cecs.pdx.edu but i am running into some problems because the linker does not support UNC paths
2014-10-03 17:23:44	patrick	is there any way to get a directory on ts that is just a regular directory?
2014-10-03 17:24:37	pfaffle	patrick: you can map the UNC path to a drive letter
2014-10-03 17:25:07	pfaffle	if it's in your homedir, just use N:\[directory] instead of \\khensu\home##\patrick\[directory]
2014-10-03 17:25:12	patrick	pfaffle: maybe, how might i do that?
2014-10-03 17:25:23	patrick	oh perfect
2014-10-03 17:25:32	patrick	thanks ill try that
2014-10-03 17:25:35	pfaffle	np
2014-10-03 17:32:15	patrick	worked
2014-10-03 17:34:59	pfaffle	awesome
2014-10-03 18:03:09	patrick	wait maybe that didnt actually work
2014-10-03 18:03:39	patrick	the linker goes through cmd so it has to be somewhere i can cd to
2014-10-03 18:04:03	patrick	is there a way to cd to N:\Desktop or something?
2014-10-03 18:06:42	--	kendall is now known as kenda
2014-10-03 18:06:43	pfaffle	yes, you should be able to get there

2014-10-03 18:09:05	patrick	i cant cd there from cmd
2014-10-03 18:09:41	patrick	maybe i am just bad at windows
2014-10-03 18:09:43	pfaffle	if you aren't currently on N:, you'll have to type 'n:' first
2014-10-03 18:09:47	pfaffle	then 'cd Desktop'
2014-10-03 18:10:32	patrick	oh ok
2014-10-03 18:11:29	patrick	well i moved the files to the C drive and it still dosent work so maybe it unrelated

2014-10-04 14:57:53	blkperl	which machine are you compiling on?
2014-10-04 14:58:09	skot	Ubuntu Linux, Intel corei5
2014-10-04 14:58:39	blkperl	I've heard people have more success on chandra Solaris 10 sparc
2014-10-04 14:58:57	blkperl	you can login to chandra remotely at chandra.cs.pdx.edu
2014-10-04 14:59:23	skot	Hmmm.
2014-10-04 14:59:54	skot	So, there's no "silver bullet," here?
2014-10-04 15:00:19	blkperl	you could try an older version of gcc
2014-10-04 15:00:29	blkperl	but then you would have to compile it yourself
2014-10-04 15:00:41	blkperl	which is non trivial
2014-10-04 15:00:48	skot	I'm not opposed to that.
2014-10-04 15:01:13	blkperl	im just guessing that an older gcc would help btw, based on the "deprecrated conversion" message
2014-10-04 15:01:45	blkperl	if you wait long enough others who have taken that class might be able to give input
2014-10-04 15:02:10	skot	I had the same thought, about the "deprecated version."
2014-10-04 15:03:07	skot	It just seems a little rinky-dink to me to offer software which is impossible to compile for a current course. :(
2014-10-04 15:03:41	skot	I'll give it a go.
2014-10-04 15:03:52	skot	If it were you, what would YOU do?

2014-10-05 14:33:55	relsqui	when you say it doesn't let you -- what happens?
2014-10-05 14:34:10	relsqui	if it prompts you for a password but nothing happens when you type, that's correct :)
2014-10-05 14:34:16	relsqui	(type it anyway and hit enter, and it should go)
2014-10-05 14:34:50	User149	Oh! Ok so I pressed enter and nothing happened as well
2014-10-05 14:35:33	relsqui	hmm. so it prompted you for a username, and you typed it and hit enter; then it prompted you for a password, you typed it (seeing nothing) and hit enter, and nothing happened? is that correct or did something else happen?
2014-10-05 14:36:20	User149	Yep, that is correct! then usually after I keep trying to type something after a while it will say there is a "fatal error" and that im disconnected from the network
2014-10-05 14:37:06	relsqui	huh. weird. okay. and you're using your usual cecs credentials?
2014-10-05 14:37:36	relsqui	(any chance you can screencap what you're seeing, just to make sure I'm not missing anything?)
2014-10-05 14:37:42	User149	Yep, my username is just myfirstname@cecs.pdx.edu
2014-10-05 14:37:45	User149	oh sure
2014-10-05 14:37:48	relsqui	oh! no, it's not :)
2014-10-05 14:37:52	relsqui	your username is just the first bit, before the @
2014-10-05 14:38:10	User149	oh my... so you mean that all i have to input is "ssh username"
2014-10-05 14:38:26	relsqui	if you're using putty, you should never have to type ssh anything
2014-10-05 14:38:46	relsqui	when you're setting up the connection in putty, the host would be linux.cecs.pdx.edu
2014-10-05 14:38:52	relsqui	and then when it asks for a username, just type myfirstname
2014-10-05 14:39:06	relsqui	and then when it asks for a password, your cecs password
2014-10-05 14:39:10	User149	Oh! Ok. Ill try this right now
2014-10-05 14:39:23	User149	Uh oh same issue..
2014-10-05 14:39:45	User149	Login as: (just my username)
2014-10-05 14:39:53	relsqui	^ where are you typing that, exactly?
2014-10-05 14:40:06	relsqui	in the setup screen or once the connection has been started
2014-10-05 14:40:19	User149	in PuTTY, once the connection has started
2014-10-05 14:40:23	relsqui	okay
2014-10-05 14:42:36	relsqui	hmm. I'd still take that screencap if it's easy; alternatively, it might be more straightforward just to bring your laptop down to the CAT tomorrow and we can take a look
2014-10-05 14:43:29	User149	Alright, Ill do that screencap right now, then If I can't solve it online, Ill bring it on down!
2014-10-05 14:43:38	relsqui	cool, thank you )
2014-10-05 14:43:39	relsqui	:)
2014-10-05 14:47:24	User149	Ok, I uploaded the screenshots to imgur.
2014-10-05 14:47:30	User149	http://i.imgur.com/XQJ4Qcb.png, what I did first
2014-10-05 14:47:42	User149	http://i.imgur.com/AKLtsMO.png, what happens next
2014-10-05 14:49:45	relsqui	okay, cool. and then if you type your password and hit enter at that prompt, what happens then?
2014-10-05 14:50:06	User149	no characters showup on screen
2014-10-05 14:50:26	relsqui	yup; that's what's supposed to happen. :) *nix normally doesn't echo your password (or even *s) as you type it
2014-10-05 14:50:32	relsqui	but if you type it anyway, and hit enter, it'll send
2014-10-05 14:51:04	User149	Oh ok! wow that is interesting.. so I should restart the process and type my password exactly as it is
2014-10-05 14:51:09	User149	and then it will confirm it if it's correct?
2014-10-05 14:52:06	relsqui	yep!
2014-10-05 14:52:21	User149	OK YES IT WORKS. finally. Thanks so much!
2014-10-05 14:52:31	relsqui	haha, you're welcome :) good luck with the homework!
2014-10-05 14:53:02	User149	OH and is there any way to let the people at the CAT know that my issue is fixed so they don't waste their time responding to my panic email?
2014-10-05 14:53:43	+mancat	you're in luck :D most tutors are also cats
2014-10-05 14:53:47	relsqui	haha, indeed
2014-10-05 14:53:47	+mancat	consider us notified

2014-10-05 14:54:16	User149	Perfect hahah, thanks again! Wow i got stuck this hard on the first homework..
2014-10-05 14:54:20	User149	this is embarrassing
2014-10-05 14:54:34	+mancat	you're not the only one, don't feel bad
2014-10-05 14:54:40	+mancat	the first ho
2014-10-05 14:54:42	relsqui	yeah. this is the right time to get stuck :) you're still SUPPOSED to be learning this
2014-10-05 14:54:48	+mancat	er
2014-10-05 14:54:50	relsqui	(and you came to one of several right places)
2014-10-05 14:55:11	+mancat	the first homework is really about learning the workflow, not writing code
2014-10-05 14:55:16	relsqui	^
2014-10-05 14:55:58	User149	Oh ok! Yeah i tried going through the codecademy python course 2 weeks before the class started and I got a little overconfident haha but
2014-10-05 14:56:09	User149	nonetheless I still am committed to going to the next level
2014-10-05 14:56:45	relsqui	sounds like you're making a really good start
2014-10-05 14:57:45	User149	Hopefully! haha, this IRC thing is really cool btw, wish I discovered this years ago
2014-10-05 14:58:27	+mancat	it's facebook from 1985 :P
2014-10-05 14:58:33	relsqui	haha, yes
2014-10-05 14:58:58	relsqui	there are a bunch of persistent channels you might find useful, like #cschat -- if you find yourself around the cs lounge some time with a few minutes on your hands, you can ask one of the tutors to show you how to get set up for it
2014-10-05 14:59:21	relsqui	there are also often channels for specific courses. probably not 161, since most students in it won't know how to use it, but definitely at the 200 level and above
2014-10-05 14:59:49	+mancat	also if you join the CAT we'll teach you to master IRC :P
2014-10-05 14:59:53	relsqui	^^^^ also this
2014-10-05 14:59:55	+mancat	(shameless plug)
2014-10-05 14:59:59	User149	Definitely gotta keep an eye out for this in the future^
2014-10-05 15:00:06	User149	oh yea! the CAT orientation is this friday apparently
2014-10-05 15:00:11	+mancat	yep
2014-10-05 15:00:12	relsqui	sure is :)
2014-10-05 15:00:27	User149	is it worth it? (asking biased people maybe? :P )
2014-10-05 15:00:33	relsqui	we're 100% biased and yes, totally ;)
2014-10-05 15:00:43	+mancat	^
2014-10-05 15:01:02	+mancat	it's been worth it for us anyway, lol
2014-10-05 15:01:05	relsqui	but, I mean -- one of the nice things about it is you can always see for yourself, and leave if it doesn't suit you
2014-10-05 15:01:08	relsqui	that's very common
2014-10-05 15:01:19	relsqui	it's not like a course where you've already paid for it and now you're stuck
2014-10-05 15:02:00	User149	very true! The IRC and helping people aspect seems very interesting/fun tho ill have to check it out
2014-10-05 15:02:20	relsqui	yeah, it's a nice place to be if you find helping people satisfying
2014-10-05 15:02:24	relsqui	because it involves a lot of that whether you like it or not
2014-10-05 15:03:41	User149	Luckily I had a little experience with customer service a summer or two ago! So now for the technical knowledge :P. Anyway I dont take up too much of your time! Have a great day guys! thanks again

2014-10-06 17:39:33	salamander	Hey there, I have a quick question about something we reviewed in class today if you guys aren't swamped with people.
2014-10-06 17:42:23	MaddHatter	usually it works best to just throw your question out there and see if anybody bites
2014-10-06 17:43:42	salamander	Oh ok haha. So can anybody explain what happens if you switch two elif or else statements (with different conditions) with each other ?
2014-10-06 17:45:45	MaddHatter	It means some test cases may see more or fewer tests than they would otherwise.
2014-10-06 17:47:21	MaddHatter	if (A==0) ... elif (A==3) ... elif (A==2) ... elif (A==1) ... If A=1, then all four tests are checked. If you move the elif A==1 up after the if A==0, then the A==2 and A==3 will never be checked.
2014-10-06 17:48:09	salamander	Oh I see. that makes sense
2014-10-06 17:48:47	salamander	And if this somehow involved a "construct" could a bug or infinite loop occur?
2014-10-06 17:48:55	@nUbee	salamander: keep in mind that the order of your elifs can lead to checks never being checked

2014-10-08 14:53:25	User476	Hello
2014-10-08 14:54:53	User476	So, I have a question regarding to the removal of all nodes in a  linked list. I pasted the code on paste bin: http://pastebin.com/vShzVWz4
2014-10-08 14:56:01	User476	and I went through the process of following the process through a diagram and I noticed that if deletion occurs within the while loop, wouldn't head be lost?
2014-10-08 14:58:02	drbop	The data that head is pointing to becomes lost, but not the actual pointer itself.
2014-10-08 15:00:50	User476	I see. So when you say lost, wouldn't this cause memory leaks?
2014-10-08 15:01:43	drbop	No.  By lost I meant deleted.
2014-10-08 15:03:10	User476	Oh good. Thank you for your help.
2014-10-08 15:03:22	drbop	You're welcome.
2014-10-08 15:04:13	User476	Just wondering, when are you guys available on this chatroom
2014-10-08 15:05:47	User476	I mean what date/time are you guys available on this chatroom.
2014-10-08 15:06:58	drbop	Tutors should be available any time during their normal operating hours that they are not swamped by helping students physically in the CS lounge, which is 11-6 Monday-Friday and 12-5 Saturday.  I'm actually an ex-tutor.  Current tutors should have a "+" to the left of their name in this channel.
2014-10-08 15:08:01	User476	Awesome! Thanks for the info.
2014-10-08 15:08:43	drbop	You're welcome.
2014-10-08 15:20:30	relsqui	User476: the tutors who are actually on duty prioritize the people who are physically in the cs lounge (which of course you're welcome to be as well!)
2014-10-08 15:20:43	relsqui	but there are often people who aren't tutors, or aren't current tutors, in here able to answer questions
2014-10-08 15:20:47	relsqui	including at hours that the tutors aren't open :)
2014-10-08 15:20:56	relsqui	(not reliably by any means, but it never hurts to check)
2014-10-08 15:32:24	User476	That's great. I needed something like this since I live outside of campus. Thanks for the info all. Take care!
2014-10-08 15:34:04	relsqui	you too :)

2014-10-11 09:25:31	User933	Hello, I had a question regarding to the copying of a linked list
2014-10-11 09:25:56	User933	the copy function starts like this: bool list::copy(list & from)
2014-10-11 09:26:52	User933	I understand that I have to create a second initialization of the list class but I was wondering how would I be able to call the head of the second list?
2014-10-11 09:30:48	ryan	User933: I am not familiar with the assignment, but it looks like you are already in the second instance of the list class with that function - so "this" would reference the list copy was called on and "from" would be a reference to the one passed in to copy.
2014-10-11 09:35:02	User933	Thank you for responding. So I believe you are saying that if I wanted to access the nodes of the second list, I would use this.head instead of from.head?
2014-10-11 09:36:56	User933	I understand how linked lists work and what to do to traverse and copy the data inside the node but I don't know how to differentiate between the first list and the second list and as to how I would call the second list
2014-10-11 09:42:06	ryan	User933: yes, I believe that is the case.
2014-10-11 09:43:12	ryan	User933: well, actually "this" is a pointer, so you would need to do "this->head" instead of "this.head".
2014-10-11 09:44:38	User933	sorry yes, I was thinking of *(this).head
2014-10-11 09:44:55	User933	great! thanks for the help. This place is pretty awesome
2014-10-11 09:44:57	User933	take care!

2014-10-13 18:47:45	ripper	is anyone out there?
2014-10-13 18:48:14	relsqui	I'm here, but I'm unlikely to be able to answer your question, I'm afraid
2014-10-13 18:48:34	relsqui	if you have time to stick around, someone may pop up who can, but the tutors are closed at the moment so the channel doesn't have official support
2014-10-13 18:49:05	relsqui	if you can't get an answer tonight, you can always stop by the cs lounge in the morning
2014-10-13 19:30:14	ripper	thanks, I am stuck on something that I need to finish by 10pm.  it is just a minor bug that doesn't make sense
2014-10-13 19:35:49	Slim	go ahead and ask the question ripper!
2014-10-13 19:36:26	Slim	:)
2014-10-13 19:54:02	ripper	can you tell me why this doesn't work? do{ ... } while ((response != "y") || (response != "n")) --- response is checked in a debugger and both options are tried but neither works
2014-10-13 20:02:28	relsqui	ripper: what's the intended behavior?
2014-10-13 20:02:35	relsqui	also, what's the value of response in your test?
2014-10-13 20:02:44	relsqui	(this turns out to not be java-specific so I might be able to answer it after all :P)
2014-10-13 20:33:43	ripper	yeah, it isn't java specific from what I can tell but the desired behave is that the do-while will end when a "y" or "n" has been entered as a response.  both have been tried and it always loops
2014-10-13 20:34:10	Slim	ripper: the reason it's always looping is because you're checking if it's not y and if it's not n
2014-10-13 20:34:35	Slim	oh, oops ignore that :x
2014-10-13 20:35:02	relsqui	ripper: what's the type and value of response in the test case?
2014-10-13 20:35:37	relsqui	(this might actually be language-specific; I don't know how C-like Java strings are)
2014-10-13 20:36:47	Slim	it may also be a good idea to use response.toLowerCase() in case the user inputs a capital Y or capital N
2014-10-13 20:37:16	ripper	i am not worried about capital at the moment.
2014-10-13 20:38:21	ripper	the check while(response != "y") means that it should only loop if something other than "y" isn't entered which implies that if I enter a "y" it should not loop
2014-10-13 21:49:15	ripper	nevermind, assignment is submitted and I will hopefully figure out what was up soon

2014-10-13 21:50:55	relsqui	oh, I see, yes

2014-10-14 16:23:22	askore	as long as you aren't adding at the head of the list, any changes you make will be in the other LLL
2014-10-14 16:23:37	askore	if you're adding at the head (or might be) then at the end you have to say head1=head again
2014-10-14 16:24:31	User984	oh ok thanks, cause I lose all of my nodes when I did it that way
2014-10-14 16:24:53	askore	are head and head1, etc. pointers?
2014-10-14 16:25:10	User984	yeah they are pointer to node
2014-10-14 16:25:17	askore	hmm
2014-10-14 16:25:21	askore	which part makes you lose the nodes?
2014-10-14 16:26:34	User984	i'm not sure, probably at the end of the function to_add
2014-10-14 16:27:12	User984	my friend tells me I shouldn't assign head=head1, head=head2,... and do the adding node for each LLL separately
2014-10-14 16:27:23	User984	so I just asking to make sure
2014-10-14 16:27:57	askore	yeah the idea is sound
2014-10-14 16:28:43	User984	alright, thanks

2014-10-18 12:17:46	Pyrrh	Question on CS163 homework (still on assignment 1). We are using ADTs. I have a node struct and a class; the private data members of the class are pointers to several linear lists. I need to output the data contents of each node, but using the usual traversal and 'cout << current -> data << endl;' is not displaying any data.
2014-10-18 12:18:14	Pyrrh	How can I get the stored data from each node to display, as part of a class member function called in main?
2014-10-18 12:19:14	relsqui	mm! good question. you'll need some code that actually displays the contents of a linked list
2014-10-18 12:19:41	relsqui	given the head pointer you already have in the data member
2014-10-18 12:20:02	relsqui	since cout doesn't know how to do that by itself
2014-10-18 12:21:24	relsqui	so your cout line is likely to either include or be replaced by a call to a function that can do that
2014-10-18 12:21:32	relsqui	(or, if it's in a function that's doing little else, that function can just become that)
2014-10-18 12:21:42	relsqui	do you see what I mean?
2014-10-18 12:22:23	Pyrrh	Hmm, okay. I will have to try playing with that. I'm a little confused why I can't just cout the data in the pointer, since if the list pointer is not part of a class it outputs without issue
2014-10-18 12:23:14	relsqui	... that's odd, so I must be misunderstanding something about your design. tell me more about what a test looks like where you can output it outside of a class and it does what yo uwant?
2014-10-18 12:23:40	Pyrrh	(for example, if I do node * head = new node; head -> data = "test"; head -> next = NULL; cout << head -> data << endl;
2014-10-18 12:23:51	Pyrrh	then the function call in main will output "test")
2014-10-18 12:24:18	relsqui	oh, yes
2014-10-18 12:24:38	relsqui	because the type of the linked list node data member is char *, and cout knows how to do that
2014-10-18 12:24:48	relsqui	but the type of a pointer *to* a linked list is node *, right?
2014-10-18 12:25:47	Pyrrh	Yes, pointer to the list is node * ptrName
2014-10-18 12:27:31	relsqui	so when you dereference it and cout it, you're asking C++ to print the contents of a node for you
2014-10-18 12:27:34	relsqui	and it doesn't know how to do that
2014-10-18 12:27:54	relsqui	... and even if it could, it would only print the head node, which is what that pointer points to
2014-10-18 12:28:13	Pyrrh	Well, I have a traversal loop with a temporary pointer, so the second part wouldn't be an issue.
2014-10-18 12:28:15	relsqui	so you actually need to write the loop that traverses the list and prints every member
2014-10-18 12:28:22	relsqui	oh, okay
2014-10-18 12:28:26	relsqui	this is already inside the loop?
2014-10-18 12:28:30	relsqui	(the cout in question is)
2014-10-18 12:28:52	Pyrrh	Yes, the cout is inside the traversal loop. So if C++ doesn't know how to print the contents of the node, why does the cout << head -> data; mentioned above work?
2014-10-18 12:29:51	relsqui	because it *does* know how to print the contents of a character array
2014-10-18 12:29:54	relsqui	which is what data is
2014-10-18 12:30:58	Pyrrh	Okay, but in my struct the node is {char * data; node * next;} and yet it is not outputting the tempPtr-> data
2014-10-18 12:31:37	relsqui	I think at this point I'd need to see the actual code, wanna pastebin it?
2014-10-18 12:31:44	relsqui	(also, NB: if you're on campus, the CS tutors are open today)
2014-10-18 12:31:55	relsqui	if it'd be easier to talk to someone face to face
2014-10-18 12:31:58	Pyrrh	I would love to, but I'm at work and pastebin is blocked ofc
2014-10-18 12:32:10	Pyrrh	It totally would be easier but I'm off at 5:30. Rock and a hard place :(
2014-10-18 12:32:14	relsqui	aw, sucks
2014-10-18 12:32:30	relsqui	also, is http://paste.cecs.pdx.edu also blocked? ;)
2014-10-18 12:32:46	Pyrrh	for sure. I do appreciate your help though! Hah, it is not - I will put some code in
2014-10-18 12:36:42	Pyrrh	Okay, try this: http://paste.cecs.pdx.edu/pixlwt2ur
2014-10-18 12:39:53	relsqui	hmm, okay. nothing's jumping out at me, so my next instinct is to question the assertion that the data's already been stored :) have you poked around in gdb to verify that the information is there?
2014-10-18 12:44:11	Pyrrh	Not really, as I'm pretty unfamiliar with its use. Is there a "GDB For Dummies" guide or the like floating around online somewhere?
2014-10-18 12:45:22	relsqui	there definitely are some, but I don't have one to recommend offhand
2014-10-18 12:46:02	relsqui	if you can spare an hour now to get comfy with it, it will save you a *lot* of hours later
2014-10-18 12:46:26	Pyrrh	when I run in gdb it states that "inferior 1 (process 5375) exited normally" so I assume that my program doesn't have any glaring issues.
2014-10-18 12:46:37	relsqui	in this particular case, the thing it will let you do is pause execution of the program right before your display call (or in it!), and manually display the contents of the pointers
2014-10-18 12:46:56	relsqui	yeah -- that's really just telling you it didn't segfault
2014-10-18 12:46:58	relsqui	but you knew that already :)
2014-10-18 12:47:08	Pyrrh	I definitely am planning to, I was just planning to on my next day off (Wednesday). It sounds like I will need to adjust my schedule
2014-10-18 12:47:52	relsqui	the tutors also generally do a gdb workshop, but I don't know if that's already passed this term
2014-10-18 12:49:57	Pyrrh	Thanks for your help :) I'll dig around in gdb for a bit and verify that my data is actually being stored
2014-10-18 12:50:16	relsqui	you're very welcome. good luck! it sounds like you're on the right track.

2014-10-18 16:48:56	Pyrrh	Here's to hoping :)

2014-10-18 16:50:19	Pyrrh	No :( I googled for a while and tried different things, but it wasn't breaking it down in the way I needed it to (or I wasn't understanding its feedback correctly). I just kept coding and wrote some error checks into my program. I now have my display fn set to return 0 if all the head pointers are set to NULL and it is returning 0.
2014-10-18 16:51:16	relsqui	ah, fair enough. well, if you do find some time to get down to the tutors (especially on a quieter day, e.g. right after a deadline), you can ask them to show you around it

2014-10-21 11:50:17	numbplum	Hello, I'm trying to add a node with this function(http://pastebin.com/YnF2WwCf) and it is telling me that I am getting a segmentation fault at line 24.
2014-10-21 11:50:57	relsqui	I'd check the initialization of head_registering
2014-10-21 11:51:12	relsqui	if it's NULL at line 19, then so will curr be at line 24
2014-10-21 11:51:17	relsqui	and thus not dereferenceable
2014-10-21 11:52:37	numbplum	I see. mm.. I think it was written correctly. Maybe I'm wrong, but I will post my initialization of head_registering
2014-10-21 11:53:25	relsqui	well, I misspoke slightly. initializing head_registering to NULL is probably correct (depending on what you're doing), but you're not checking whether it is
2014-10-21 11:53:25	numbplum	http://pastebin.com/hCMzQeqc
2014-10-21 11:53:37	numbplum	oh..
2014-10-21 11:53:45	relsqui	so if you're calling that on an empty list, it'll segfault :)
2014-10-21 11:53:48	numbplum	let me check if i did that
2014-10-21 11:54:20	numbplum	yeah i built the list on head_registering
2014-10-21 11:54:24	numbplum	and set the last node to null
2014-10-21 11:56:38	relsqui	I'd still check, in your original paste around line 19, whether curr is already NULL before the while loop starts
2014-10-21 11:56:59	relsqui	the easiest way to do that is with gdb, but if you're not comfortable with that yet you can just do the test in the code
2014-10-21 11:58:16	numbplum	ok someone helped me and it was just setting my while(curr) to while(curr->next != NULL)
2014-10-21 11:58:44	numbplum	I tend to think that curr is also curr->next..
2014-10-21 11:58:52	numbplum	thanks for your help!
2014-10-21 11:59:08	relsqui	np, good luck o/

2014-10-21 12:37:12	User195	sure
2014-10-21 12:38:41	User195	first time using it. shared it as public, I think
2014-10-21 12:39:33	relsqui	drop the link in here? :)

2014-10-21 12:41:02	wrabble	those little typos will get ya
2014-10-21 12:42:05	User195	did that no change though
2014-10-21 12:43:17	relsqui	paste the actual error?

2014-10-21 12:46:34	relsqui	with exactly that case?
2014-10-21 12:46:49	relsqui	(if so, show us the definition?)
2014-10-21 12:48:15	relsqui	er, wait
2014-10-21 12:48:23	relsqui	User195: you haven't defined the return type of the function
2014-10-21 12:48:54	 *	relsqui looks again
2014-10-21 12:49:02	relsqui	you want it to be a constructor, but it's not, because the case is different
2014-10-21 12:49:09	relsqui	College_life::College_Life
2014-10-21 12:49:22	relsqui	one of those is wrong, I dunno which, but it's whichever one isn't the same as your header file
2014-10-21 12:49:31	relsqui	so C++ thinks it's a regular function and needs a return type
2014-10-21 12:49:58	relsqui	if you fix the case to be consistent, it should recognize it as a constructor and stop requiring that
2014-10-21 12:50:14	User195	i added that after the error hoping to fix it. took it out and still same issue.
2014-10-21 12:50:17	User195	http://pastebin.com/jyJc1Xw7
2014-10-21 12:50:32	relsqui	okay, so they should both be capital
2014-10-21 12:50:36	relsqui	change College_life to College_Life
2014-10-21 12:51:18	relsqui	(do you see what I'm talking about/why C++ is getting confused?)
2014-10-21 12:51:48	User195	Oh yes. man. You all are awesome. thank YOU
2014-10-21 12:52:03	relsqui	:D got it?
2014-10-21 12:53:06	User195	Yes. it worked. Last place I expected
2014-10-21 12:53:11	 *	relsqui nods
2014-10-21 12:53:24	relsqui	sorry for the wild goose chase; I should've followed my own advice and started from the error
2014-10-21 12:53:45	relsqui	if it says "does not name a type," it was expecting you to name a type, and the right next question was "why"
2014-10-21 12:54:58	User195	sorry i'm so slowww. u are good. I knew it had to do with namespace but failed to see my typo
2014-10-21 12:55:15	relsqui	eh, it happens. best of luck with the rest of the project :)
2014-10-21 12:55:53	User195	thanks. I appreciate your help

2014-10-26 18:03:23	relsqui	at a minimum, it can tell you *where* the segfault is; if you compile your program with the -g flag, you can then `gdb a.out` and type `run` to start it and then `bt` to see where it segfaulted
2014-10-26 18:03:48	relsqui	(sorry, I'm not a tutor and I don't have a ton of time to help debug right now, but I can at least point you in a direction and maybe someone else who's freer will pop up)

2014-10-27 11:47:14	Mike	I hear we can ask some questions on this...
2014-10-27 11:47:25	relsqui	indeed!
2014-10-27 11:47:26	relsqui	what's up?
2014-10-27 11:48:44	Mike	C++ (163 homework). Got a queue that will hold an ordered list.
2014-10-27 11:49:07	Mike	The queue is a circular array. The ordered list is a dynamic array.
2014-10-27 11:49:30	Mike	My brain fart is that I can't think of how to do the constructor.
2014-10-27 11:49:39	relsqui	aha. well, what do you need to construct?
2014-10-27 11:49:47	Mike	Good question...
2014-10-27 11:50:02	Mike	So the data for the node should be the store name.
2014-10-27 11:50:08	relsqui	d'you remember what in general constructors are necessary for?
2014-10-27 11:50:20	Mike	so that's a character array... I do remember, yes.
2014-10-27 11:51:02	Mike	The product info would, I'm currently thinking be a pointer to an object of the type of my product_info class.
2014-10-27 11:51:16	relsqui	if you're still figuring out the schema, do that first
2014-10-27 11:51:26	relsqui	know the types of all your class variables before you start writing the constructor
2014-10-27 11:51:29	relsqui	then writing the constructor is easy
2014-10-27 11:53:03	Mike	hmm. okay then.
2014-10-27 11:53:11	relsqui	make sense/see why? :)
2014-10-27 11:56:49	Mike	That I get, sure. I'm just trying to get how when I define the enqueue function. For example int enqueue(priority_list & list, char * store_name), I'll be passing, ultimately, the address of the list.
2014-10-27 11:57:38	Mike	So the q_node's data would, really, only need to store a pointer of type priority_list and a pointer of type char.
2014-10-27 11:57:57	Mike	And those are the pointers that I'd create when I use the constructor.
2014-10-27 11:58:16	relsqui	the pointers are *created* when you instantiate the class; the constructor's job is just to initialize stuff
2014-10-27 11:58:27	relsqui	especially but not only pointers
2014-10-27 11:59:13	Mike	Right. Let me correct myself. I'll be initializing the pointers that were created to NULL. I can define the struct I'm using to store the store_name and list using pointers.
2014-10-27 12:00:05	Mike	Though, now I'm thinking I'll need to define the function as:
2014-10-27 12:00:33	Mike	Well...
2014-10-27 12:00:53	Mike	maybe not... Maybe I have it right. I'll give it a go.
2014-10-27 12:01:35	 *	relsqui grins
2014-10-27 12:01:37	relsqui	when in doubt, try it
2014-10-27 12:06:50	Mike	duh, of course I'm setting my q_node itself to null in the constructor... I don't need to create a node there.

2014-10-29 11:22:39	Harris	Yo, got a question...
2014-10-29 11:23:03	Harris	(hi, howdy, and good morning!)
2014-10-29 11:23:46	relsqui	(morning!)
2014-10-29 11:24:12	Harris	Okay, FYI, homework is submitted, this is just a best practices kind of question...
2014-10-29 11:24:26	Harris	C++ 163 is where I'm at.
2014-10-29 11:24:48	relsqui	mmkay
2014-10-29 11:24:57	Harris	Okay, so say I've got a list of stores I want to keep track of as well as a reject stack of stores I visited that didn't work out.
2014-10-29 11:25:16	Harris	Is there any particular reason I shouldn't implement these under a single class?
2014-10-29 11:25:43	Harris	For the assignment 2, I get it, shuffling things from one class to another is part of what we were learning.
2014-10-29 11:26:42	relsqui	I haven't seen the assignment, but from that description I'd have to give you the pretty unsatisfying answer of "it depends"
2014-10-29 11:27:02	Harris	But, couldn't I have, say, a store_data class (or something) and in that class as private data have a node for a flexible array and a q_node for a CLL (assuming I wanted to use these types of structures)
2014-10-29 11:27:23	relsqui	the whole point of object-oriented programming is to keep the pieces of the program in discrete chunks, not necessarily because you need them to be right now, but because you might later
2014-10-29 11:27:30	Harris	Right.
2014-10-29 11:27:37	Harris	Totally get that.
2014-10-29 11:27:44	relsqui	so it could very well be true that for your particular program you didn't need them to be two classes
2014-10-29 11:27:58	relsqui	but if they were both part of a larger program and something else was going to be operating on each piece, it would make more sense
2014-10-29 11:28:04	Harris	Valid point.
2014-10-29 11:28:10	relsqui	this is one of the hard things about programming academically
2014-10-29 11:28:16	relsqui	you sort of have to take design stuff like that on faith
2014-10-29 11:28:19	Harris	lol
2014-10-29 11:28:22	Harris	Fair enough.
2014-10-29 11:28:30	relsqui	because for most of the time you're in school you won't be working on very large projects over a long period of time
2014-10-29 11:28:40	relsqui	and you only get a few chances to collaborate on them
2014-10-29 11:29:00	relsqui	(which, of course, is a good reason to do personally-interesting projects whose outcome you care about in your spare time ;) )
2014-10-29 11:29:33	Harris	Indeed. I need to get up to speed on git and github and find some projects...
2014-10-29 11:30:35	relsqui	that++
2014-10-29 11:30:36	Harris	Would the tutors be willing to chat about side projects and how to get myself up to speed on git/github?
2014-10-29 11:30:43	Harris	Not over irc, mind you.
2014-10-29 11:30:57	Harris	(++that ... come on!)
2014-10-29 11:31:05	Harris	;-)
2014-10-29 11:31:14	relsqui	no harm in asking :) even if the tutors themselves don't have an idea in mind, asking around the CS lounge is a good idea in and of itself
2014-10-29 11:31:20	relsqui	I use an optimizing compiler, doesn't make a difference ;)
2014-10-29 11:31:31	Harris	haha
2014-10-29 11:31:34	Harris	Cool thanks.
2014-10-29 11:31:38	relsqui	np. good luck!
2014-10-29 14:08:20	Slim-Reaper	Harris: for general CS chat we also have a #cschat channel. If you go over there we can talk about talking abou git some time :)
2014-10-29 14:09:55	Slim-Reaper	Or I'm sure that's relevant enough for this channel haha... Where are you at with your git knowledge?

2014-11-02 18:49:35	Pyrrh	I've got a compile issue in c++ (taking 163 right now). I can tell that it's got an issue with data types and/or lack of operator overload, but I can't tell why. Anyone around willing to try to help me pin it down?
2014-11-02 18:51:14	relsqui	can try, but no promises :) got a pastebin?
2014-11-02 18:53:36	Pyrrh	Putting it together; one min
2014-11-02 19:00:53	Pyrrh	http://pastebin.com/7bLAs2r7
2014-11-02 19:02:37	relsqui	what's the error?
2014-11-02 19:02:44	relsqui	oh derp, it's in there, sorry
2014-11-02 19:03:01	Pyrrh	I snuck it in at the end :)
2014-11-02 19:05:06	relsqui	what's the return type of user_info::copy_entry()?
2014-11-02 19:05:24	Pyrrh	nt
2014-11-02 19:05:26	Pyrrh	*int
2014-11-02 19:05:40	Pyrrh	probably should be bool since it's just 0 or 1, but...
2014-11-02 19:05:45	relsqui	so you're trying to assign that int to a position in your array of user_info pointers
2014-11-02 19:05:48	relsqui	and C++ is going "wat?"
2014-11-02 19:05:52	Pyrrh	oh!
2014-11-02 19:05:54	relsqui	:)
2014-11-02 19:05:58	Pyrrh	no, that's not what I want at all
2014-11-02 19:06:02	Pyrrh	hmm, okay
2014-11-02 19:07:20	Pyrrh	now I just have to figure out how to actually get that data into the array. Thank you!
2014-11-02 19:10:03	 *	relsqui grins
2014-11-02 19:10:06	relsqui	you're welcome!
2014-11-02 19:10:14	relsqui	want a hint?
2014-11-02 19:11:05	Pyrrh	Definitely :D
2014-11-02 19:11:20	Pyrrh	I know I'm forgetting something I already know how to do
2014-11-02 19:11:44	relsqui	you can pass the location where you want it to be stored *into* the copy function
2014-11-02 19:12:50	Pyrrh	I had a feeling it was going to require pointers and a function rework.
2014-11-02 19:13:16	relsqui	just a little bit.
2014-11-02 19:13:23	Pyrrh	Welp
2014-11-02 19:13:23	relsqui	you probably either just had or are just about to have a lab which uses this technique
2014-11-02 19:13:28	Pyrrh	time to roll up  my sleeves
2014-11-02 19:13:30	relsqui	(I'm not currently tutoring so I haven't seen the assignments/labs in a while)
2014-11-02 19:13:32	relsqui	have fun! :)
2014-11-02 19:13:48	Pyrrh	I'm sure I"ll be back if (when?) I mess something up and can't quite figure it out
2014-11-02 19:13:57	Pyrrh	Thanks again! It is much appreciated
2014-11-02 19:14:25	relsqui	of course!

2014-11-03 19:11:48	Pyrrh	Hello :) Back again with another type mismatch issue and still no resolution (I gave up on the previous one in the interest of time and am running into the problem in a different part of my program). Trying to store data into a CLL, whose node is of a class datatype, using the datatype's member functions. Anyone around who wants to help straighten me out?
2014-11-03 20:27:53	+Hubris	you really have to go down the line from node to data member to data member of that data member
2014-11-03 20:28:03	+Hubris	I can't really help you without seeing the code
2014-11-03 20:28:13	+Hubris	pastebin or something similar can help
2014-11-03 20:31:04	Pyrrh	http://pastebin.com/k4MnpFA0
2014-11-03 20:32:29	+Hubris	what line is the compiler error on?
2014-11-03 20:33:11	+Hubris	oh nvm
2014-11-03 20:33:17	Pyrrh	It appears on line 56 of the queue.cpp file
2014-11-03 20:33:25	+Hubris	did you make a new store?
2014-11-03 20:34:04	Pyrrh	No, I just made a new q_node which has an empty store
2014-11-03 20:34:28	+Hubris	no you didn't
2014-11-03 20:34:36	+Hubris	when you allocate memory for a node
2014-11-03 20:34:51	+Hubris	you get a pointer to a store thatshould be null
2014-11-03 20:35:02	+Hubris	so when you use the line referenced by a tutor
2014-11-03 20:35:16	+Hubris	you should use curr->store = new store
2014-11-03 20:35:28	+Hubris	which allocates memory for a store
2014-11-03 20:35:43	+Hubris	and then you can copy?
2014-11-03 20:35:51	Pyrrh	I will certainly give that a try
2014-11-03 20:36:07	+Hubris	or you can set that in your node constructor
2014-11-03 20:36:23	+Hubris	that any time you make a new node it automatically makes memory for a store
2014-11-03 20:36:53	+Hubris	either or, but remember what scope you are in or you won't have access
2014-11-03 20:37:29	+Hubris	if not the tutors are open from 11 am to 6 pm and you can get more help
2014-11-03 20:38:38	Pyrrh	So I now have
2014-11-03 20:39:59	+Hubris	?
2014-11-03 20:40:04	Pyrrh	 q_node * current = new q_node;  current -> store = new user_info; //this is the data type of store;    current -> store.copy_entry(visitHere); and have the same issue. I also tried current -> store = visitHere.copy_entry(visitHere), but it also does not work (and I expected it not to)
2014-11-03 20:40:15	Pyrrh	I will have to try to swing in tomorrow. Crossing my fingers they let me out of work!
2014-11-03 20:41:40	+Hubris	i think you might have some issues with enqueue
2014-11-03 20:41:59	Pyrrh	This is quite possible
2014-11-03 20:42:00	+Hubris	current->next = rear doesn't add at the end
2014-11-03 20:43:09	+Hubris	you should set current->next = rear->next
2014-11-03 20:43:16	Pyrrh	Ah, yes. That particular block of code is the special case where rear is the only node in the list. I also have another block where current -> next = rear -> next
2014-11-03 20:43:26	+Hubris	oh
2014-11-03 20:43:32	+Hubris	sorry i'm really tired
2014-11-03 20:43:37	Pyrrh	You and me both :)
2014-11-03 20:43:44	Pyrrh	Those midterms, tho
2014-11-03 20:44:04	Pyrrh	Appreciate the help ^^
2014-11-03 20:44:09	+Hubris	the issue was a const store * and store * mismatch?
2014-11-03 20:44:32	+Hubris	i mean const user_info and user_info * mismatch
2014-11-03 20:44:40	Pyrrh	Yes
2014-11-03 20:44:43	+Hubris	i see it with current->store
2014-11-03 20:44:59	+Hubris	so current->store is still a pointer to user_info
2014-11-03 20:45:12	Pyrrh	rather than the data itself. That makes sense
2014-11-03 20:45:18	+Hubris	so using a pointer = object cannot work
2014-11-03 20:45:32	+Hubris	because you are passing an object as the argument
2014-11-03 20:46:12	+Hubris	did you use that line you pasted on line 56 as well?
2014-11-03 20:46:28	+Hubris	oh wait
2014-11-03 20:46:42	+Hubris	it should be current->store = new user_info
2014-11-03 20:46:58	+Hubris	current->store->copy(visitHere)
2014-11-03 20:47:12	+Hubris	I'm assuming your user_info copy function takes a const user_info
2014-11-03 20:47:36	Pyrrh	Can I use indirect access store -> copy if store is of user_info type and copy is a member function of user_info?
2014-11-03 20:47:47	+Hubris	yeah
2014-11-03 20:48:14	+Hubris	dot for object arrow for pointer
2014-11-03 20:48:27	Pyrrh	holy hell it compiles finally
2014-11-03 20:48:31	+Hubris	yup
2014-11-03 20:48:41	+Hubris	gj
2014-11-03 20:48:53	Pyrrh	you are spot on about needing to allocate the store memory
2014-11-03 20:48:58	Pyrrh	Ten thousand thank-yous
2014-11-03 20:49:03	+Hubris	that's usually the case
2014-11-03 20:49:07	+Hubris	your welcome
2014-11-03 20:49:38	Pyrrh	Now I just have to test it all in main

2014-11-03 20:49:58	+Hubris	lol good luck

2014-11-04 21:51:45	SIRAF	I'm trying to delete a key from a dictionary in python but getting that key from a list. I can't seem to get it right since the dictinoary key has quotes and the name from the list does not come out with the quotes.
2014-11-04 21:52:19	relsqui	the quotes are actually in the data in the dictionary key?
2014-11-04 21:52:32	SIRAF	yes
2014-11-04 21:52:39	SIRAF	it doesn't seem to work without them
2014-11-04 21:52:59	relsqui	oh -- you need to use quotes to refer to the string, yes
2014-11-04 21:53:04	relsqui	it doesn't mean the quote marks are actually in the data
2014-11-04 21:53:18	SIRAF	okay, noted
2014-11-04 21:55:23	SIRAF	I'm trying to use this...
2014-11-04 21:56:05	SIRAF	del dinv[inv[discinv]]
2014-11-04 21:56:39	SIRAF	where dinv is the dictionary and inv is the list and discinv is the index number of the item in the list
2014-11-04 21:58:02	relsqui	so far so good
2014-11-04 21:58:04	relsqui	what's not working?
2014-11-04 21:59:50	SIRAF	if I try to delete the last index item I get an error
2014-11-04 22:00:02	relsqui	aha
2014-11-04 22:00:12	relsqui	how many items are in the list?
2014-11-04 22:00:26	SIRAF	IndexError: list index out of range
2014-11-04 22:00:57	SIRAF	I was working with 2 and upped it to 3
2014-11-04 22:01:02	 *	relsqui nods
2014-11-04 22:01:06	relsqui	and what's the number of the index when it fails?
2014-11-04 22:01:41	SIRAF	when it was 2 items I was trying to del dinv[inv[1]]
2014-11-04 22:01:57	SIRAF	1 being the variable value of discinv
2014-11-04 22:02:41	relsqui	is that the only deletion, or are you deleting other stuff first? (like iterating through the indices)
2014-11-04 22:03:54	SIRAF	ahh, yes, I'm deleting the inv list first... it should work if I just reverse the order yes?
2014-11-04 22:04:16	relsqui	maybe -- what are you actually trying to do?
2014-11-04 22:05:10	SIRAF	rudementary inventory system that as per assignment has to use tuples list and dictionary, I'm trying to delete something from the inventory list and dictionary
2014-11-04 22:05:55	SIRAF	it appears that just swapping the order has it working
2014-11-04 22:06:22	SIRAF	thanks relsqui you saved me a bunch of time and head bashing
2014-11-04 22:06:36	relsqui	haha, I didn't quite follow that last bit but of it works it works
2014-11-04 22:06:39	relsqui	welcome! :)
2014-11-04 22:08:11	SIRAF	relsqui++
2014-11-04 22:08:19	SIRAF	not sure if that works here or not
2014-11-04 22:08:24	relsqui	nope, but thanks *g*
2014-11-04 22:44:49	SIRAF	if I have code to catch someone putting in invalid input si there a way to have it error and start them over? Currently I have it print an error message and break
2014-11-04 22:47:17	relsqui	there are a couple; have you learned about loops yet? :)
2014-11-04 22:47:28	SIRAF	like for and while loops?
2014-11-04 22:47:36	relsqui	yup
2014-11-04 22:47:49	SIRAF	generally yes but I wouldn't say I'm all that terrific with them
2014-11-04 22:48:38	relsqui	well, this is a chance to practice if you want to :) you can have it keep looping as long as the input is invalid
2014-11-04 22:49:16	SIRAF	 /thinks about how to do that...
2014-11-04 22:49:23	relsqui	I'll brb so you have some time to chew on it
2014-11-04 23:01:21	SIRAF	okay, it seems to work if I put a whiie True: at the start of the section
2014-11-04 23:01:32	SIRAF	but I'm not sure I completely understand why
2014-11-04 23:04:12	SIRAF	also if I don't force an error it does reset to the top
2014-11-04 23:43:15	SIRAF	I think I got it working
2014-11-04 23:43:33	SIRAF	make sure every if has an else (at some point)
2014-11-05 01:09:54	relsqui	SIRAF: sorry, had to take off, but remind me some time and we can look at it :)

2014-11-05 14:40:33	Pyrrh	I am practicing recursion. Can someone help me understand why my display function is an infinite loop? I currently have it pass in a pointer to a node, and then I call cout << on the data (of int type), and tell it to return displayAll(head->next) + 1;
2014-11-05 14:46:14	ryan	Pyrrh: do you have a base case?
2014-11-05 14:46:41	Pyrrh	I do, when head is null it returns 0
2014-11-05 14:47:22	Pyrrh	as an if/else (so if !head return; else cout & call fn again)
2014-11-05 14:47:50	ryan	Pyrrh: That sounds correct, but are you sure that head eventually does become null?
2014-11-05 14:48:18	Pyrrh	I will double-check!
2014-11-05 14:49:48	Pyrrh	You know what, that's not even where my error is happening. I mis-identified. Thank you :)
2014-11-05 14:51:42	ryan	Pyrrh: heh, cool, well I'm glad you're back on track, good luck!
2014-11-05 14:51:49	Pyrrh	Thanks!
2014-11-05 15:07:48	Pyrrh	What do you normally pass into a recursive class function from main, when the relevant class member is private?
2014-11-05 15:09:08	ryan	Pyrrh: That sounds like it might make sense as a method of the class, but I am saying that without knowing the context - don't trust me. :)
2014-11-05 15:10:34	ryan	Pyrrh: If there is a reason you want to keep it out of the class, then you can just have a method on the class that will call the recursive function for the private data type, and use that method to indirectly call the recursive function instead.

2014-11-05 15:12:24	Pyrrh	I have the recursive display function as a member function of the class but don't know what to pass it
2014-11-05 15:12:54	ryan	ah, alright.
2014-11-05 15:13:43	ryan	Pyrrh: so you want it to recurse to the next instance of the class?
2014-11-05 15:14:40	Pyrrh	Ah, no. I've got a LLL class, which has a private head pointer as its data member. Then I have the public display function, which needs to be passed a node so that I can traverse the list
2014-11-05 15:15:47	ryan	Pyrrh: OK. you should be able to just pass it the head the first time, then the next item in the recursive call.

2014-11-05 15:17:27	ryan	ah, now I see what you mean. you could overload it with another function that takes no arguments, and passes head (which it can do, from within the class) to the overloaded recursive function.
2014-11-05 15:17:49	Pyrrh	super, thanks again!
2014-11-05 15:18:21	ryan	or, maybe it would be possible to just set the head variable as the default value for that particular argument, but I'm not sure if C++ allows that.

2014-11-05 15:31:15	MaddHatter	default parameters are actually supplied by the compiler in the TLU where the function call happens based on the function declaration
2014-11-05 15:31:40	MaddHatter	since a private value is not accessible from where the function call happens, it can't be used
2014-11-05 15:31:50	 *	ryan had a feeling there would be some technicality there. MaddHatter++, thanks!
2014-11-05 15:32:49	MaddHatter	incidentally, if you make the private value static, the compiler will probably not complain, but you'll get an error from the linker when the symbol doesn't exist
2014-11-05 15:37:26	Pyrrh	MaddHatter: Thanks!

2014-11-05 18:00:40	commander	how can i extract higher 8 bits from int and stored in char
2014-11-05 18:00:50	commander	i have the code but itsnot working
2014-11-05 18:23:19	commander	never mind
2014-11-05 19:04:59	Krampus	commander: y = x >> 8;
2014-11-05 19:27:59	kini	int is usually 32 bits
2014-11-05 19:28:09	kini	depends on the setup though
2014-11-05 19:30:46	kini	to be safe, you might want to do y = 0xFF & (x >> (sizeof(int) * 8 - 8))
2014-11-05 19:30:47	kini	lol
2014-11-05 19:30:53	kini	(even chars can be more than 1 byte)
2014-11-05 19:31:04	kini	on standard x86 you probalby want y = x >> 24

2014-11-05 21:47:57	MaddHatter	"higher" demands concern for endianness, not to mention signedness
2014-11-05 21:49:04	MaddHatter	(I assume "stored in char" doesn't mean a lexical cast here)
2014-11-05 22:01:35	kini	endianness actually doesn't matter
2014-11-05 22:01:49	kini	>> works on the uint value
2014-11-05 22:01:55	kini	(according to C semantics)
2014-11-05 22:02:02	kini	and not on the actual bit pattern in memory
2014-11-05 22:02:41	kini	and masking by 0xFF means you don't have to worry about sign extension happening

2014-11-05 23:12:58	MaddHatter	kini: the endianness matters in the char-to-int conversion, and the sign extension matters if you actually want to preserve it
2014-11-05 23:13:13	kini	where is there a char to int conversion?
2014-11-05 23:13:21	MaddHatter	"how can i extract higher 8 bits from int and stored in char"
2014-11-05 23:13:31	kini	that looks like an int to char conversion
2014-11-05 23:13:43	kini	though the english in that sentence is in sufficient disarray that I suppose there are multiple interpretations
2014-11-05 23:14:00	MaddHatter	I was reading it as "I have char[4] and want to cast it to int and get the upper byte"
2014-11-05 23:14:15	kini	I was reading it as "I have int and want to get its upper byte into a char"

2014-11-08 23:11:25	apels	what is it
2014-11-08 23:11:50	apels	it's a struct or class but what does it control
2014-11-08 23:13:48	apels	derp
2014-11-08 23:15:34	Binx	umm
2014-11-08 23:15:38	Binx	it just hold information
2014-11-08 23:15:41	apels	i see
2014-11-08 23:15:46	Binx	to be used to initiate
2014-11-08 23:15:48	apels	i was being derpy
2014-11-08 23:15:49	Binx	my Morg
2014-11-08 23:15:54	Binx	which is like a ameoba
2014-11-08 23:15:59	Binx	its a simulation
2014-11-08 23:16:57	apels	if you just need the delim
2014-11-08 23:17:16	apels	it should be in the file input.getline
2014-11-08 23:17:20	apels	as one of the args
2014-11-08 23:17:22	apels	iirc
2014-11-08 23:17:40	Binx	so I'm working off of some example code but they used a class constructor to initialize theres
2014-11-08 23:17:45	Binx	and its not organized well
2014-11-08 23:18:02	Binx	theres works for how they did it but im using a struct to pass the information
2014-11-08 23:18:07	Binx	and I dont know how to read the output
2014-11-08 23:18:17	Binx	C,8,14,Paddle,Envelop A B D,Mate
2014-11-08 23:18:22	Binx	this has a type of ameoba
2014-11-08 23:18:25	Binx	then its x loc
2014-11-08 23:18:27	Binx	then y
2014-11-08 23:18:31	Binx	then movement type
2014-11-08 23:18:35	Binx	then how it eats
2014-11-08 23:18:46	Binx	followed by the types of ameoba it can eat
2014-11-08 23:18:46	apels	so you need to create a vector or linked list of structs
2014-11-08 23:18:48	Binx	a b and d
2014-11-08 23:18:50	Binx	in this case
2014-11-08 23:18:59	Binx	yeah I have that
2014-11-08 23:19:02	Binx	its the vector string
2014-11-08 23:19:06	apels	yea just thinking

2014-11-08 23:19:20	apels	i write my ideas s/write/type/
2014-11-08 23:19:23	apels	>.>
2014-11-08 23:19:24	Binx	good deal
2014-11-08 23:19:28	Binx	not trying to argue with you
2014-11-08 23:19:31	apels	it'sk
2014-11-08 23:19:37	Binx	your obivously much more experienced than I am  =D
2014-11-08 23:19:38	apels	just trying to parse code
2014-11-08 23:19:41	Binx	yea
2014-11-08 23:19:41	apels	eh..
2014-11-08 23:19:43	Binx	i know its kinda wierd
2014-11-08 23:19:45	Binx	code to read
2014-11-08 23:19:48	Binx	thats why im stuck
2014-11-08 23:19:49	Binx	lol
2014-11-08 23:20:48	apels	seeing the surrounding code might be hhelpful...
2014-11-08 23:20:50	apels	but
2014-11-08 23:21:07	apels	so where does it seem to fail???
2014-11-08 23:21:35	apels	!
2014-11-08 23:21:43	apels	these strings and vectors
2014-11-08 23:21:57	apels	why do people not use use cstrings and manually handle an array ro linked list for stuff
2014-11-08 23:21:59	apels	anyway
2014-11-08 23:23:39	apels	so if i am right there is only one init
2014-11-08 23:23:44	Binx	yea
2014-11-08 23:23:51	Binx	so im trying to assign things from the array
2014-11-08 23:23:53	Binx	to the init
2014-11-08 23:23:55	apels	ok
2014-11-08 23:23:58	Binx	so it parses it into a vector
2014-11-08 23:23:59	apels	now it makes sense
2014-11-08 23:24:08	Binx	so vector[1] im hoping is the first position
2014-11-08 23:24:18	apels	idk how vectors work
2014-11-08 23:24:18	Binx	then init.x = vector[1]
2014-11-08 23:24:21	Binx	something like that
2014-11-08 23:24:27	apels	i usually use arrays but i prefer C over C++
2014-11-08 23:24:36	apels	ok
2014-11-08 23:24:37	Binx	yeah I usually use arrays also
2014-11-08 23:24:38	apels	i see
2014-11-08 23:24:42	Binx	but I didnt feel like allocating the space
2014-11-08 23:24:45	Binx	and stuff
2014-11-08 23:24:48	Binx	so I just went for the easy thing
2014-11-08 23:24:56	Binx	which ended up not being easy
2014-11-08 23:24:59	Binx	so i kinda regret it
2014-11-08 23:25:12	Binx	i think i might have it working i just need to fill out some test code
2014-11-08 23:25:14	Binx	to see
2014-11-08 23:25:21	apels	                std::vector<std::string> tokens = tokenize(buf, ',');
2014-11-08 23:25:27	apels	the issue is probably here then
2014-11-08 23:25:47	apels	i don't know how tokenize works
2014-11-08 23:26:00	apels	but checking the C++ docs on this
2014-11-08 23:26:02	apels	would be good
2014-11-08 23:26:37	apels	i would guess it isn't setting them correctly.. but honestly i don't know how vectors and tokenize functions so idk how much help i can be...
2014-11-08 23:27:08	apels	but
2014-11-08 23:27:59	apels	vector of strings named tokens gets some list of tokens from buf
2014-11-08 23:28:17	apels	so i might assume that tokenize does not return in such a way that the vector structure can input it
2014-11-08 23:28:29	apels	so you may have to input manually using something like getline with , as a delim
2014-11-08 23:29:11	Binx	ok
2014-11-08 23:29:51	apels	it may return an array??? or maybe a vector but vecotrs may not be able to be set by the = op
2014-11-08 23:29:56	apels	like it's being used???
2014-11-08 23:30:47	apels	you may also use a print to see if the data is reading correct
2014-11-08 23:30:55	apels	so you can see where things are failing and comment out
2014-11-08 23:31:02	apels	when it is working

2014-11-09 16:24:47	User652	I'm working on creating a hash table that stores song information (artist name, title, etc.) using each word in the song title as a key. My problem is, I can't seem to figure out how to split up the song title into individual word keys.
2014-11-09 16:26:48	User652	Any thoughts? I looked into strtok but I'm not exactly sure how it works.
2014-11-09 16:53:08	bloc	strtok does break up strings into parts. you are correct to want to use it
2014-11-09 16:56:54	bloc	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strtok/
2014-11-09 16:57:15	bloc	this ^ has a detailed explaination on the use of strtok
2014-11-09 16:57:49	User652	OK, great. But from what I gathered, it doesn't seem to actually allocate any data for new char arrays or pointer variables. So how can I hash on the tokens?
2014-11-09 16:58:09	User652	Thanks, that's the link that gave me the idea.

2014-11-09 17:30:18	User652	Nvm, you guys are right. I just tested out a fragment of code using strtok and it seems to be working how I was hoping it would. Sweet. thanks!

2014-11-09 21:34:10	User501	It's about delete

2014-11-09 21:34:24	User501	allocating data as a local variable in that function
2014-11-09 21:34:46	User501	do I need to delete that before the function returns?
2014-11-09 21:35:21	nightfly	if you allocated it with new/malloc and didn't return it, yes
2014-11-09 21:35:29	User501	And if I do return it?
2014-11-09 21:35:53	nightfly	then whatever receives it becomes responsible for ensuring it gets freed
2014-11-09 21:35:54	taron	Then you need to make sure it gets deleted once you're done with the returned value.

2014-11-10 19:31:56	Kratos	After weeks of waiting for the next hw in cs201 we finally we get a puzzle of a hw and it's over my head.
2014-11-10 19:32:14	askore	Kratos: oh? tell us about it
2014-11-10 19:34:18	Kratos	A function is being called recursively a number of times with 3 arguments. In the body of that function I have to write a function that prints out the three arguments in hex form but there are no arguments passed to it and the only library function we can use is putchar().
2014-11-10 19:45:10	Kratos	Don't know how to access the data in the variables in the caller using a callee with no arguments.
2014-11-10 19:45:58	askore	hrm
2014-11-10 19:46:05	askore	without mucking around in memory, you can't.
2014-11-10 19:46:14	askore	I'm not sure if that's the intention of the assignment
2014-11-10 19:46:16	askore	?
2014-11-10 19:52:54	dondon	Kratos: is the assignment requirements somewhere we can look at them?
2014-11-10 19:56:11	Kratos	web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/cs201/HW3.pdf
2014-11-10 19:57:52	Kratos	My idea was trying to get access into the registers themselves (%eax, %ecx, %edx, etc) but aren't successful
2014-11-10 20:10:04	malaclypse	Kratos: I was thinking about declaring a pointer in recover() and offsetting from that to the caller's stack frame. I'm not sure how well it will work yet though.
2014-11-10 20:18:14	Aatrox	that makes sense malaclypse
2014-11-10 20:23:20	Kratos	malaclypse: How would I know how to set the pointer and off set it using c code. I can see it done perfectly using assembly language and the base pointer but can't imagine the code in c.
2014-11-10 20:23:44	Aatrox	well you know how much the caller's stack frame is theoretically
2014-11-10 20:24:15	Aatrox	i haven't looked at the provided functions yet, but are they all pointers i assume?

2014-11-10 20:28:58	Kratos	None of the provided functions have pointers. The variables come in as string from main, turned into integers and passed by value into the recursive function.
2014-11-10 20:31:44	<--	persistentCrab (thx1138@webe.cat.pdx.edu) has quit (Client Quit)
2014-11-10 20:40:09	malaclypse	well (and this is just a guess), if you declare a pointer in recover, the frame pointer for recover should be at that +1, and the return address of the caller at +2, and +3 should get into the caller's local variables.
2014-11-10 20:41:17	malaclypse	it looks like foo has 3 local variables, so that takes you to +5, so +6 should be a, +7 b, +8 c. Except that doesn't take into account the compiler saving registers
2014-11-10 20:51:49	Kratos	I'll experiment with off setting. Thanks.

2014-11-11 21:01:56	Wren	s/wy/2y/
2014-11-11 21:03:09	Wren	y^2 - 1 is (y-1)(y+1), so you have x = y(y-1)(y+1), but I don't know where to go from there
2014-11-11 21:03:14	Shep	so i get to x=2y(y^2-1) and hit a wall
2014-11-11 21:03:46	Wren	Except that x is 0 when y is 0, 1, or -1
2014-11-11 21:03:48	Shep	right so x=2y(y+1)(y-1)
2014-11-11 21:04:01	Wren	but i'm stuck, try wolfram alpha
2014-11-11 21:05:07	Shep	how do i get it to solve for y
