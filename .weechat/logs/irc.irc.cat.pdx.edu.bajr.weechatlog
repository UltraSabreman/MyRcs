2014-07-20 21:51:42	sabreman	I'd love to join this game
2014-07-20 21:51:52	sabreman	if you havne't started it yet or w/e
2014-07-24 17:42:15	sabreman	This is what I was thinking for my charecter:
2014-07-24 17:42:37	sabreman	wait firstly, how is ht emilitary system for our world
2014-07-24 17:42:52	sabreman	like, is it mandatory service, how long do you server for, etc?
2014-07-24 17:45:23	sabreman	well, assuming that it's sumewhat close to ours (if it's not i'l re-work the desing)
2014-07-24 17:45:54	sabreman	I'm thinking military surgeon, served 4 years and just got out (~6 months ago)
2014-07-24 17:46:27	sabreman	never saw action, but treated plenty of people reguardless (stupid injuries, if there's some sort of conflict, people form there)
2014-07-24 17:47:37	sabreman	not sure how detailed you wnat this but anyway
2014-07-24 17:47:56	sabreman	very good surgeon, works well under pressure
2014-07-24 17:50:08	sabreman	but he amost always does what he thinks is best
2014-07-24 17:50:37	sabreman	has some basic combat traning (boot camp)
2014-07-24 17:51:49	sabreman	For a quick backstory: Had an alchacolic father and a mother that didn't really care, so had to fend for him self/ put himself through highschool + collage
2014-07-24 17:53:50	sabreman	reads a ton and learned most of his stuff from books.
2014-07-24 17:54:39	sabreman	has some sort of attentive disorder that basicly means he has a hard time relaxing + has to be doing stuff if he can help it
2014-07-24 17:55:24	sabreman	and has a *tiny* magical ability (if this is allowed) that he's not really aware of, but that helps him out and is part of the reason why he's such a good suregon
2014-07-24 17:55:33	sabreman	I think this makes sence
2014-07-24 17:55:39	sabreman	if you need more details let me know
2014-07-28 17:40:59	sabreman	?
