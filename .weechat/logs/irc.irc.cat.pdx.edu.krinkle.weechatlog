2013-02-14 11:56:00	Sabreman	Are you gonna be there between 3 and 6 today so i can give you my hours? I can also email a singed+scaned copy if you wish.
2013-02-14 11:58:35	krinkle	I will be around, but you can also hand it to one of the people at the front desk at the CAT and ask them to put it on my desk
2013-02-14 11:59:01	Sabreman	ok.
2013-03-15 15:58:25	krinkle	I need your timesheet as soon as possible!
2013-03-15 15:59:12	krinkle	If you can't get it to me by 5 today then I will need it on Monday and there is a risk of your paycheck being delayed
2013-03-16 18:29:48	sabreman	OH shoot, im so sorry. After my cs202 profficney thing on nfriday we went to get out passports updated in seattle, I totaly forgot to do this.

2013-03-16 19:08:27	krinkle	looks good
2013-03-16 19:08:50	krinkle	in general you can just go ahead and submit it, if I need you to correct it you can "retrieve" it and fix it
2013-03-16 19:14:57	sabreman	awesome thanks. I'll do my best not to forget next time.
2013-03-16 19:15:32	sabreman	one more thing, is there any way i could possible probably mabie get a few extra hours next term?

2013-03-16 19:17:13	krinkle	okay, might be best to assume you will so that I don't have to change the schedule once classes start

2013-06-12 11:21:26	krinkle	so timesheets are due on the 15th of every month or the Friday before. It's fine if you want to email it to me, but you have till Friday to give it to me and it looks like you're working tomorrow.

2013-06-12 14:59:03	sabreman	at least thinking that it was due on the 12th is better than forgeting about it till the 17th.
