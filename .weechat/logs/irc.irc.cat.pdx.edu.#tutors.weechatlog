2013-01-18 12:07:01	+alevar	I'm trying to understand how Karla wants the 163 students to return from the symbol table's get() method.
2013-01-18 12:07:08	+alevar	Is it just a pointer to a struct?
2013-01-18 12:13:21	@krinkle	I'd guess printing it to stdout would suffice, otherwise make a copy or return a reference
2013-01-18 12:14:05	+alevar	k
2013-01-18 12:14:09	+alevar	thx
2013-01-22 00:41:56	+alevar	The linked list of arrays used in 163 is an unrolled linked list
2013-01-22 00:42:36	+alevar	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list
2013-01-22 11:14:57	@krinkle	lpl: if knick (re: #cshelp) comes in, ping me and I'll come over
2013-01-22 14:45:07	+lpl	krinkle: got it. Im not sure if he came in, but beaker is my go to guy for that starting at 12, so I think we have it covered
2013-01-22 14:45:40	@krinkle	cool
2013-01-22 14:45:47	@krinkle	I think there's also acm people
2013-01-22 17:56:23	+avi	does anyone know about the message "The users access request is pending with CPSO" when requesting keycard access?
2013-01-22 18:41:17	@krinkle	I'm not sure, but I don't think it hurts to send it again
2013-01-22 19:20:41	+avi	I checked the key card history and there was request from Jan 15. His card still doesn't work by now.
2013-01-25 11:36:18	@krinkle	I'm having second thoughts about opening early, I have a feeling it won't be successful. Let me know if you guys have feelings about it or if you get feedback from students about it.
2013-01-25 11:38:53	@krinkle	but for now let's just keep it at 11
2013-01-25 12:40:49	nUbee	krinkle: What did you have in mind? Like 9 or 10 AM?
2013-01-25 12:43:33	@krinkle	 10am was the plan, but I don't think anymore that it will be busy enough that early to warrant that
2013-01-25 12:47:25	nUbee	It is pretty quiet in the morning. I could see people needing help after 6pm (especially the procrastinators), but I'm not sure how realistic that would be. Personally, I'd tutor after 6
2013-01-28 15:44:30	@krinkle	I'm thinking no meeting tomorrow...I don't really have anything to talk about.
2013-01-28 15:44:53	@krinkle	If there are no objections...
2013-01-28 16:09:57	+askore	no objections here

2013-02-01 09:04:57	@krinkle	If anyone is able I would very much appreciate it if someone could cover my shift 11-2ish today. I'm feeling very ill.
2013-02-01 09:08:31	@krinkle	The shift is till 3:30 but askore gets there at 2, so the length of the shift would be up to the person covering

Who would I ask/coordinate with to reserve that room?
2013-02-05 16:48:57	@krinkle	lpl: talk to beth
2013-02-05 16:49:41	@krinkle	I think they really only reserve that room for CS and MCECS things

2013-02-05 16:54:58	+lpl	Sounds fair, the date is the end of Feb. Should I email beth then?

2013-02-13 09:25:48	nUbee	hey guys! so I'm trying to determine whether or not I'm fit to come in today. The fever is gone, however I still have a pretty stuffy nose and muffled hearing. I'm not sure if that means I'm still contagious. What do you guys think?
2013-02-13 09:29:46	lewisrjc	my uninformed opinion is go back to sleep
2013-02-13 09:45:28	+askore	my similarly uninformed opinion agrees
2013-02-13 09:45:40	nUbee	I guess me staying home would be for the best. I really don't want to spread any illness.
2013-02-13 09:46:25	nUbee	physically, I can tutor. But it's not worth getting students sick
2013-02-13 09:48:22	nUbee	will there be enough on duty today?
2013-02-13 10:04:46	@krinkle	nUbee: yep, I'm pretty sure we'll be fine

2013-02-19 13:20:09	jesusaurus	wow, really? 202 students need an hour-long tutorial on how to use an editor?
2013-02-19 13:20:34	jesusaurus	is it mostly trivia like what the classpath should be in our environment, or is it actually how to use an ide?
2013-02-19 13:23:48	@krinkle	I think it's really how to use the idea
2013-02-19 13:24:06	@krinkle	monleezy: what kinds of things did you cover when you did this workshop?
2013-02-19 13:25:51	jesusaurus	i guess it is before they get into the foray of learn-to-teach-yourself of operating systems and compilers
2013-02-19 13:26:27	jesusaurus	but still, it makes me sad that they need a tutorial above and beyond a list of environment settings
2013-02-19 13:35:53	@krinkle	also probably a little "what is a jre" etc
2013-02-19 13:45:09	lewisrjc	krinkle: I will probably be on campus that day, and have even used that environment profesionally (gasp) admittedly briefly and could probably be convinced to do a tutorial

2013-02-19 14:39:08	monleezy	and if there's time/interest from students, built-in plugin repos (CDT for c/c++, git/hg, fun stuff like emacs/vim bindings)
2013-02-19 14:46:19	monleezy	iirc i just made some derived HelloWorld objects with print statements that showed dynamic binding
2013-02-19 14:51:41	lewisrjc	yeah, all right, so the basics then
2013-02-19 14:51:45	lewisrjc	figured as such
2013-02-19 14:51:46	lewisrjc	thanks
2013-02-19 15:07:39	monleezy	no prob
2013-02-19 15:10:56	@krinkle	lewisrjc: room is 40-06, exact time she says is 10:15-12:05

2013-02-20 07:52:41	lewisrjc	it looks like it has to do with the dynamic nature of the language (scope has less meaning when variables are just...where ever

2013-03-05 10:18:51	lewisc	but I wouldn't reccommend that
2013-03-05 10:19:20	lewisc	either restart your screen twice a term or find a box that doesn't get rebooted would be my suggestion

2013-03-14 13:56:26	@krinkle	tutors and trainees: if your schedule needs to be altered for finals next week please let me know asap
2013-03-14 13:57:23	@krinkle	will also need availability for next term soonish
2013-03-14 14:09:57	beaker_	krinkle: are you in the zonebah?
2013-03-14 14:10:11	@krinkle	beaker_: yep
2013-03-14 14:10:22	beaker_	ok will drop off time sheet now
2013-03-14 14:10:28	@krinkle	kk
2013-03-14 14:13:02	beaker_	also, i may be a bit late getting schedule to you for next quarter, i need to wait for departmental acceptance before i can sign up for anymore upper division CS classes
2013-03-14 14:18:02	@krinkle	beaker_: okay
2013-03-15 10:57:03	@krinkle	nUbee: you forwarded something to tutors@cs yesterday, did you also answer her question?
2013-03-15 12:15:00	nUbee	krinkle: I did not, she sent her code to me, and not tutors@cs. I assumed she was sending more code in regards to that #cshelp session you mentioned, so I didn't answer it
2013-03-15 12:15:25	nUbee	I also was guessing she replied to me, and not "to all"
2013-03-15 12:28:40	+alevar	Oh no. There's quite a bit left for her to do.
2013-03-15 12:29:37	+alevar	Or did she just cut out the code that handles anything except for jobs?
2013-03-15 12:32:54	+alevar	Oh, nvm, she did
2013-03-17 19:17:01	protoben	krinkle: I should be able to submit my availability by tomorrow. Also, it looks like I misread the finals schedule, and it turns out I have a final that goes until 11:15 tomorrow. So I might be a little late to my 11:00 shift, although I'll try not to be. Sorry for not letting you know sooner.
2013-03-17 19:36:12	@krinkle	protoben: no problem, thanks for letting me know

2013-04-12 15:49:36	+lewisc	ah
2013-04-12 15:49:39	+lewisc	odd
2013-04-12 15:49:41	+lewisc	that's...
2013-04-12 15:49:45	+lewisc	going to confuse people
2013-04-12 15:49:47	+lewisc	but whatever
2013-04-12 15:50:19	@krinkle	why?
2013-04-12 15:51:13	+lewisc	uh open ended assignments are always a little confusing to beginners
2013-04-12 15:51:21	@krinkle	oh I hadn't read it yet
2013-04-12 15:51:27	+lewisc	since they don't usually realize that the point is the concept not the code
2013-04-12 15:51:35	+lewisc	and "for example, compound interest"
2013-04-12 15:51:38	+lewisc	yeah no
2013-04-12 15:51:56	+lewisc	it's "do something with math"
2013-04-12 15:52:06	 *	lewisc reads to make sure he isn't making an ass of himself
2013-04-12 15:52:26	+lewisc	"because math is fun
2013-04-12 15:52:40	+lewisc	There's a bitter part of my sould that loves this guy
2013-04-12 15:52:45	+lewisc	both sarcastically and really
2013-04-12 15:53:55	@krinkle	oh yeah "Decide what your program will do", that's a little wtf
2013-04-12 15:54:24	+lewisc	and then the example is a fairly subtle calc 2/3 concept
2013-04-12 15:54:34	+lewisc	that's going to just be noise distracting them
2013-04-12 15:54:46	+lewisc	but whatever
2013-04-12 15:54:53	+lewisc	we'll muddle through somehow
2013-04-12 15:55:07	+lewisc	brian g on the other hand I am leaving you to deal with

2013-04-12 15:59:31	@krinkle	is this a real karla assignment?
2013-04-12 15:59:54	+lewisc	I don't think so
2013-04-12 16:00:02	+lewisc	hazarding a guess it's something for his work
2013-04-12 16:00:10	+lewisc	which he shouldn't be doing on school computers
2013-04-12 16:00:13	+lewisc	but uh...
2013-04-12 16:00:14	+lewisc	yeah
2013-04-12 16:00:21	+lewisc	I am going to let you figure that one out
2013-04-12 16:00:32	 *	lewisc is largely speculating there
2013-04-12 16:00:42	 *	krinkle looks
2013-04-12 16:02:11	@krinkle	it's not in her first assignment
2013-04-12 16:02:20	@krinkle	but he cc'd karla
2013-04-12 16:02:22	@krinkle	weird
2013-04-12 16:02:51	+lewisc	I am suspicious
2013-04-12 16:03:08	+lewisc	um
2013-04-12 16:03:15	+lewisc	oh I just got more suspicious
2013-04-12 16:03:18	+lewisc	here's a hint guys
2013-04-12 16:03:29	+lewisc	if your CTO and COO are in cs 161
2013-04-12 16:03:35	+lewisc	people are going to be suspicious
2013-04-12 16:07:41	+lewisc	huh he's a math guy apparently

2013-04-25 22:59:06	@krinkle	alevar: think you could cover? i could take 11-1 or 11-2 so you don't have to be there the whole day

2013-06-03 15:45:01	+askore	looks good to me, I do have a final on thursday the 13th that overlaps with my hours by a few minutes. very unlikely to actually cause a problem, just a heads up.

2013-06-04 12:04:21	--	Guest1212 is now known as lewisrjc
2013-06-04 13:44:33	@krinkle	meeting today I think
2013-06-04 14:18:54	lewisrjc	yeah just noticed that
2013-06-05 10:26:54	nUbee	there is a Lenovo AC adapter on the front desk. Does this belong to any of you? Or shall I take it to the CAT?
2013-06-05 11:35:58	+alevar	An idea: Why don't we request that Karla run the assignments by a tutor or two before assigning them?
2013-06-05 11:36:05	+alevar	Just a check for clarity.
2013-06-05 11:36:45	+alevar	We spend/waste way too much time on frankly poorly worded specifications.
2013-06-05 11:54:49	beaker	i second alevar
2013-06-05 13:07:08	lewisrjc	mmm...second guessing profs isn't really our business.
2013-06-05 13:57:11	+alevar	lewisrjc: Or *anyone* who might give some advice. We've wasted many hours trying to decode a sentence or two.
2013-06-05 14:00:39	jesusaurus	maybe get a grad student to do it?
2013-06-05 14:01:23	@krinkle	I think it might be more practical for us to read the assignments after she posts them but prior to a tutor meeting, then we can discuss them and ask her for clarification if necessary
2013-06-05 15:40:07	+alevar	If should had someone take a look over it (not necessarily us), it could save a lot of people a lot of time.
2013-06-05 15:42:12	+alevar	Not just for us and our tutorees. For everyone in the class.
2013-06-05 21:25:05	Racoon	Agree with alevar
2013-06-05 21:35:47	Racoon	it'd be really cool to have a list of things she is looking for from these wacky karla structures
2013-06-06 09:22:02	lewisrjc	krinkle: that's actually what I was thinking
2013-06-06 09:22:32	lewisrjc	Racoon: my impression for what she's looking for is code
2013-06-06 10:16:22	@krinkle	^ basically. Things she cares about won't be vague (such and such data structure, must be able to insert, display, remove, whatever). Everything else is completely subject to interpretation and will get full points.
2013-06-06 10:16:40	<--	krinkle has kicked Guest76739 (Guest76739)
2013-06-06 10:17:07	@krinkle	oops, I didn't realize dragging on a name in weechat would kick someone
2013-06-06 10:17:47	@krinkle	alevar: sorry ^
2013-06-06 10:18:08	+askore	was that alevar?
2013-06-06 10:27:40	@krinkle	 /whois says it was
2013-06-06 11:20:20	protoben	krinkle: next term's schedule: looks like i'll have class mon-thurs 2:15-3:20, and i have a class that starts right at 6 tues and thurs, so it'd be hard for me to close up. otherwise i'm free.
2013-06-06 12:34:51	Racoon	lewisrjc: oh right, but it'd be nice to have a list detailing the level of expectation in terms of control constructs, pointer usage and such
2013-06-06 12:35:32	Racoon	on of my biggest problems is not knowing what level these guys are and I'm sick of catching myself pushing copy constructors on 162 students :P
2013-06-06 12:39:30	lewisrjc	I am responding to that tutor request btw, going to at least find out what's going on
2013-06-06 13:36:33	@krinkle	Racoon: if you check out her website each class has a section for lecture materials, and that page is kind of like a syllabus for the class
2013-06-06 13:36:58	@krinkle	you should be able to glean very basically what a cs162/163/202 student should be learning and what they should have already covered
2013-06-06 13:37:32	@krinkle	lewisrjc: which request?
2013-06-06 13:39:14	Racoon	krinkle: good call
2013-06-06 13:40:30	Racoon	krinkle: heads up, I'm going to be just a couple minutes late to my shift today
2013-06-06 13:55:30	lewisrjc	krinkle: there was a blast from beth about some lady needing a cs 162 tutor which made me confused
2013-06-06 13:56:15	lewisrjc	sorry, it was from the ungergrad coordinator
2013-06-06 14:03:07	@krinkle	oh must be in my student mail
2013-06-06 14:33:49	lewisrjc	I am going to evaluate the situation, I am suspicious that either a) she's a pcc student or b) she isn't aware tutors exists
2013-06-06 14:34:07	lewisrjc	in the case of the latter I will point her to us, if she actually wants 1:1 time I will offer it
2013-06-06 14:43:28	+alevar	askore: The kicked user was alevar-exiled.

2013-06-23 11:36:35	+alevar	krinkle: What's happening with a tutor meeting over the summer?
2013-06-23 11:46:15	+alevar	BTW, Monday before 6 or any time Tuesday/Thursday are my best times for a tutor meeting.
2013-06-24 11:11:04	+alevar	A heads up: I just got a cold that has totally knocked out several people who got it.
2013-06-24 11:11:28	+alevar	I might at some point need to be filled in for if it gets intense enough.
2013-06-24 11:11:32	+alevar	krinkle: ^
2013-06-24 11:12:29	Racoon	I /win 9
2013-06-24 11:13:14	Racoon	If I'm not hitting my limit on hours I could fill in if needed alevar:
2013-06-24 11:14:17	+alevar	Ugh. I was hoping this wouldn't happen. :(
2013-06-24 13:21:44	nUbee	Do we have a limit if we're not taking classes?
2013-06-24 17:45:40	@krinkle	as I understand it, PSU's limit when you're not taking classes is 40 hours/week
2013-06-24 17:46:11	@krinkle	the CS department or MCECS or something might have a slightly different idea, but I've never been clear on what it is or whether it matters

2013-06-25 07:47:10	@krinkle	I told karla to send account requests for online students to me when I should have said tutors@cs, I'm going to forward them
2013-06-25 07:47:52	@krinkle	If you guys could validate these accounts in crack and then send them the formletter in /stash/tutors/docs/moarp_communication.txt (and cc tutors@cs) that would be awesome
2013-06-25 07:48:17	@krinkle	make sure to fill in <these things> with actual values
2013-06-25 07:49:47	@krinkle	let me know if you have questions

2013-06-25 11:48:58	Racoon	krinkle: one user is asking for password reset and verification of username, should i reset and attach the printout or ask them to come in?
2013-06-25 11:50:21	@krinkle	the moarp site can handle password resets
2013-06-25 11:50:31	@krinkle	when they log in it shows them a pdf of the account sheet
2013-06-25 11:50:45	@krinkle	same for new accounts
2013-06-25 11:51:03	@krinkle	don't attach any account information for anyone

2013-06-25 12:19:13	lewisrjc	Oh whoops, was that oh...know
2013-06-25 12:19:20	lewisrjc	I think it's a blank page if nothing is pending
2013-06-25 12:19:41	lewisrjc	that might be an enhancement request to post a "if you expect something, wait a half hour"
2013-06-25 12:20:09	lewisrjc	but we'll hear back in a bit if it failed
2013-06-25 12:21:23	Racoon	gotcha
2013-06-25 12:21:49	lewisrjc	krinkle: can you confirm this behavior?

2013-06-25 12:58:12	lewisrjc	looks like moarp isn't working
2013-06-25 12:59:49	@krinkle	it won't show you anything if you haven't made your own account or reset your password

2013-06-26 19:36:48	lewisrjc	5:00 would be ideal, 5:30 would be survivable

2013-06-30 20:04:21	+alevar	Because of the time that my capstone group meets, I'm going downtown on Monday just for the meeting. It would be handy to combine tutoring and meeting, if you're okay with it.
2013-07-01 14:14:31	protoben	alevar: sorry, just saw your message. are you asking me to cover for you tuesday? I'm afraid I have desk shift next door until 4.
2013-07-01 14:14:54	protoben	i could cover the second half, though, if you could get someone else to do the first.
2013-07-01 15:34:07	+alevar	protoben: I was looking at switching shifts if it was convenient for you. Apparently it is not, neh?

2014-11-10 10:51:50	protoben	so, i seem to have picked up a case of food poisoning somewhere.
2014-11-10 10:52:08	protoben	don't think i'll be able to make my shift today.
2014-11-10 10:52:48	protoben	i'll see if i'm done shivering and vomiting by the 1-ish, though. maybe i can make the second half.
2014-11-10 10:53:06	protoben	sorry for the late notice. came on kind of sudden.
2014-11-10 11:20:44	sabreman	protoben: hope you feel better soon.
2014-11-10 12:11:41	@nUbee	oh that reminds me: TIMESHEETS!
2014-11-10 12:11:53	@nUbee	Please have them to me as soon as you have a moment
2014-11-10 12:12:15	@nUbee	in fact, I'd ask any tutor on duty to take a break from tutoring to do that
2014-11-10 12:43:50	sabreman	nUbee: are you at the cat?
2014-11-10 12:45:59	@nUbee	sabreman: not at the moment
